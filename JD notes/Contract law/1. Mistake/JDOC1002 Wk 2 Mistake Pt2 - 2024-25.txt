Elements to be established for rectification of instrument ( Tang Kwai 
Cheung v Yeung Sze Ting [2024] 2 HKLRD 1324, HKCA):
the parties had a continuing common intention, whether or not 
amounting to an agreement, in respect of a particular matter in the 
instrument to be rectified;
there was an outward expression of accord;
the intention continued at the time of the execution of the instrument 
sought to be rectified; and
by mistake, the instrument did not reflect that common intention.
Is the common intention determined on the basis of objective 
intentions or subjective intentions of the parties?
Rectification of contracts
UK: 
Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] 1 AC 1101 per Lord 
Hoffmann (obiter): 
objective intentions
FSHC Group Holdings Ltd v Glas Trust Corporation Ltd [2020] Ch 365 (Eng

objective intentions critical
If contract formed at the same time as when the written document was 
executed: subjective intentions critical

Non est factum
Signed contract may be void under doctrine 
(defence) of non est factum (it is not my deed)
Non est factum applies where person did not 
sign document
Non est factum
Non est factum also applies where person signed where:
Signer was under disability that prevents them from being 
able to read or understand document
Fundamental or radical difference between document 
signed and what signer believed they were signing
Signer was not careless
See Saunders v Anglia Building Society [1971] AC 1004
Failure by person of full capacity to read document 
before signing not sufficient to establish non est factum
Non est factum
Mistake as to legal effect of document also insufficient 
to establish non est factum
Saunders v Anglia Building Society
Kincheng Banking Corp v Kao Yu Kuei [1986] HKC 212

signed involved him taking up some obligation re

of option under belief that he was signing a receipt
Petulin v Cullen (1975) 132 CLR 355
But not radical difference where signing guarantee 
of existing and future indebtedness, believing 
guarantee to only cover future indebtedness
O’Brien v Australia and New Zealand Bank Ltd (1971) 
5 SASR 347
Non est factum and unilateral 
mistake
Where unmistaken party seeks to enforce contract:
No need to establish absence of carelessness by 
mistaken party to render contract void: Petulin v 
Cullen
Apply principles of operative unilateral mistake as to 
terms where mistake known by other party 
Non est factum and unilateral 
mistake
Where case involves rights of third party who acted in 
good faith in reliance on signed document without 
notice of mistake
Mistaken party not entitled to assert absence of consensus 
ad idem against third party (ie unilateral mistake principles 
not applied; only basis for setting aside contract is non est 
factum)
Why? Estoppel? 
Alternatively not true estoppel but person not allowed to 
take advantage of own wrong against third party (where 
there was carelessness): Saunders v Anglia per Lord 
Hodson
