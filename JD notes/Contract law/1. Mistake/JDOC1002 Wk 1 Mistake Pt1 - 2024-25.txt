Law of Contract II
JDOC1002
1. Mistake –Pt 1
General
Scenario: one or both parties enter into contract under a mistake as 
to some matter
Are the parties bound by the contract? 
Should the parties be bound?
General
The law: is there a remedy for the mistaken party (or parties)?
Often no: the contract stands and is binding
Why?
Objective theory of contract
Certainty of contracts
But factors favouring a remedy:
Fairness
Need for “integrity” of actual agreement: consensus ad idem
Reasons why mistake may arise
Examples of circumstances involving mistake:
Mistake caused by misrepresentations
Often (but not always), sufficient to analyse under law of 
misrepresentation
Mistake arising through no fault of either party 
Categories of mistake
Common mistake –both parties under same mistake
Mutual mistake –parties at cross -purposes
But be careful re terminology: terms not always used consistently 
by judges or writers
Unilateral mistake –only one party mistaken
Legal consequences / remedies 
where operative mistake
Main remedy: no contract formed (or contract void ab 
initio)
Other (potential) equitable remedies:
Contract voidable in equity (contract may be rescinded)
Refusal to grant specific performance of contract
Rectification of contract
Mutual mistake
Where mutual mistake operative:
No contract formed
Offer and acceptance do not coincide (no 
consensus ad idem)
Possible that parties not ad idem even if there is literal 
correspondence between offer and acceptance
Mutual mistake
Raffles v Wichelhaus (1864) 2 H & C 906
Facts:
Agreement for purchase of cotton to arrive by ship 
“Peerless from Bombay”
But two ships named Peerless, one sailing in October, 
other in December
Goods shipped in December
Buyer refused to take delivery
Mutual mistake
Issue:
Could fact that there were two ships with same name 
give def buyer a defence to a claim by pl seller for 
the price?
Held: yes
Case interpreted as giving rise to possibility of 
contract being void for mutual mistake (no contract 
formed –parties not ad idem)
Mutual mistake
Is result consistent with objective theory of contract?
Yes
Latent ambiguity in words used: either interpretation of 
words is reasonable
Objectively, not possible to determine that there is 
correspondence between offer and acceptance
Mutual mistake
Scriven Bros & Co v Hindley & Co [1913] 3 KB 564
Facts:
Pl selling hemp and tow by auction
Auction catalogue: described 2 sets of goods with same shipping mark (S.L. Lots 
63–67 (47 bales) and S.L. Lots 68 –79 (176 bales))
Samples of both Lots available for inspection at pl’s showroom –Lot numbers 
shown
Def buyer inspected first sample (hemp) but did not inspect second sample 
(tow), believing it was also hemp 
Def made bids for both Lots at auction; goods knocked down to def 
After discovering that second set of Lots was tow, def refused to pay  
Mutual mistake
Jury’s findings of fact:
Auctioneer intended to sell tow (for Lots 68 –79)
Def intended to bid for hemp
Held:
No contract formed for purchase of tow
Parties not ad idem as to subject matter of sale
True ambiguity: offer and acceptance did not coincide 
Goods never properly described in catalogue nor 
showroom
Mutual mistake
Mutual mistake operative only if the objective 
facts are equivocal (as to which interpretation is 
correct)
If one interpretation can objectively be 
determined to be correct, then there is only 
unilateral mistake
Mutual mistake
Goldsborough Mort & Co Ltd v Quinn (1910) 10 CLR 674
Facts:
Contract for sale of land –price of £1, 10s per acre “calculated on a freehold basis”
Was price simply £1, 10s per acre (vendor’s view) or did price payable require 
deduction for conversion from leasehold to freehold (purchaser’s view)?
Held:
Purchaser’s interpretation correct
Wording clear and unambiguous in meaning
Unilateral mistake on part of vendor and not mutual mistake
Unilateral mistake
Mistake about some matter relating to the 
contract is not sufficient on its own to give rise to 
operative mistake
Even if other party to contract knows that 
mistaken party is contracting under the mistake: 
Smith v Hughes (1871) LR 6 QB 597
Caveat emptor –let the buyer beware
Unilateral mistake
Smith v Hughes (1871) LR 6 QB 597
Facts:
S offered to sell oats to P, with sample given to P
P agreed to buy
P discovered oats were new oats and not old 
oats; refused to take delivery
S sued P
Unilateral mistake
Court of Queen’s Bench: if contract never specified 
that oats are to be “old” oats, then –
S’s knowledge that P intended to purchase old oats is 
not decisive in rendering mistake operative
Parties ad idem if contract was simply for sale of the 
oats corresponding to the sample inspected by P
But position different if S knew that P believed that old 
oats was a term of the contract (ie P’s belief is that S 
warrants that old oats are being sold)
Unilateral mistake –mistake as to 
terms of contract
Principle that can be derived from Smith v 
Hughes :
Unilateral mistake is operative if there is a 
mistaken belief as to a term of the contract and 
the other party knew (or ought reasonably to 
have known) of that mistake
Unilateral mistake –mistake as to 
terms of contract
Compare “snapping up” cases
Hartog v Collin & Shields [1939] 3 All ER 566
Sale of hare skins stated at a price “per pound”
Seller intended to sell at price “per piece”
Buyer snapped up offer, as price per pound 
would be a bargain (3 pieces correspond to 1 
pound)
No contract as parties not ad idem
Contract void for operative 
unilateral mistake
Remedy where unilateral mistake operative: no 
contract (or contract void) –
Smith ; Hartog
Is this consistent with objective theory of contract?
One view: this is an exception to the objective 
theory (since subjective intention of mistaken party 
protected)
but exception justified and does not conflict with 
rationale of objective theory
Contract void for operative 
unilateral mistake
Alternative view: this is still an application of the 
objective theory
Eg Hartog : 
Objectively possible to ascertain that real agreement was 
price per piece
No reasonable person could form view that there was 
agreement on the literal terms
Objectively, not reasonable for P to believe that there was 
consensus ad idem for sale at price per pound
True intentions, objectively ascertained, do not correspond 
to the literal agreement  
Additional remedy for operative 
unilateral mistake
“Apparent contract” void (because of mistake 
of mistaken party)
But actual contract enforceable on terms as 
intended by mistaken party (and known to other 
party) –to reflect true intentions:
Ulster Bank Ltd v Lambe [2012] NIQB 31
Where unilateral mistake not known by 
unmistaken party
Court may deny specific performance if unjust 
to impose burden on mistaken party due to 
hardship:
Burrow v Scammell (1881) 19 Ch D 175 at 182
Tamplin v James (1880) 15 Ch D 215 at 221
But mistaken party still liable for damages for 
breach of contract if party does not perform:
Webster v Cecil (1861) 30 Beav 62 at 64
Unilateral mistake –mistake as to 
identity of contracting party
Usual scenario: mistake induced by misrepresentation of 
rogue (fraudster)
Eg A purports to contract with B, believing B to be C because 
of B’s misrepresentation
Contract voidable for misrepresentation
But is contract void for unilateral mistake (no contract)?
Issue is critical where contract involves sale of goods to rogue 
who then sells to innocent third party
Nemo dat quod non habet (no one can give what they do not 
have)
Unilateral mistake –mistake as to 
identity of contracting party
Where offer made personally to specific individual, no other person 
can accept offer so as to bind the offeror:
Boulton v Jones (1857) 157 ER 232
Alternative analysis (putting the same point differently):
Where specific identity is intended to be a term of the contract, 
then unilateral mistake as to identity is operative to render contract 
void where unmistaken party knew of the mistake
But contract not void if mistaken party indifferent as to whether only 
a specific individual is to be the contracting party
Ie not intended by mistaken party that specific identity of other 
party is to be a term of the contract
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing face -to-face
Strong presumption that parties intend to deal with person in front of them
Phillips v Brooks Ltd [1919] 2 KB 243 
Facts:
Pl jeweller sold pearls + ring to rogue (R) in shop
R paid by cheque as a Sir George Bullough
Pl knew of the latter; checked directory and address given by R
Pl allowed R to take ring first after receiving cheque
Cheque dishonoured; R pawned ring with def pawnbrokers
Pl sued def
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing face -to-face
Held:
Contract between pl and R not void (only voidable)
Pl intended to deal with person in shop (R) even though 
mistaken as to R’s identity
Pl’s claim against def failed
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing face -to-face
Ingram v Little [1961] 1 QB 31:
Facts:
Sale of car by Elsie and Hilda Ingram
R test drove car and wished to pay by cheque, but Elsie 
declined
R then said he was Mr P G M Hutchinson of Stanstead House, 
Stanstead Rd, Caterham
Hilda checked phone directory at post office
Sisters then agreed to accept cheque
R sold car to def
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing face -to-face
Eng CA (maj) held:
Presumption that parties dealing face -to-face intend to 
deal with person physically present; rebutted only on clear 
evidence
Presumption rebutted on facts of the case
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing face -to-face
Lewis v Averay [1972] 1 QB 198 
Facts:
Pl (Lewis) sold car to R who misrepresented that he was the 
actor Richard Greene
Pl accepted cheque after R produced special admission 
pass to Pinewood Studios with the name “Richard A 
Green” and photo of R
R sold car to def (Averay)
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing face -to-face
Eng CA held:
Contract formed between pl and R
Contract voidable but not void
Lord Denning MR and Phillimore LJ: nothing to rebut 
presumption
Megaw LJ: pl failed to prove that identity of person was a 
matter of vital importance, as opposed to general 
concern for creditworthiness
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing face -to-face
Can cases be reconciled?
Each case depends on its own facts/circumstances
Basic issue: whether identity was intended to be a term 
of the contract
Not easy to prove (face -to-face cases)
Strong presumption that it is not (face -to-face cases)
Can be rebutted only in exceptional circumstances 
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing at a distance in writing
Same broad principle as for face -to-face cases but presumption 
different
Cundy v Lindsay (1878) 3 App Cas 459:
Facts:
Blenkarn (R) ordered goods from Lindsay (L) by letter
Order form: R gave name of Blenkiron & Co, of 37 Wood St, Cheapside 
L knew of reputable firm Blenkiron & Co (carried on business at 123 Wood St, 
Cheapside)
L despatched goods without checking address of firm
R sold goods to Cundy
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing at a distance in writing
Held:
No contract between R and L
L only intended to contract with Blenkiron & Co (as 
specified in written correspondence)
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing at a distance in writing
Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson [2004] 1 AC 919
Facts:
Motor dealer was to sell car to R
R required loan finance from finance company and transaction was 
structured as a hire purchase: car to be sold to finance co, who 
would lease car to R
R used stolen drivers licence (Mr Durlabh Patel) as proof of identity; 
draft hire purchase agreement specified Durlabh Patel as customer 
Finance co ran credit check on Durlabh Patel and then approved 
transaction
R took car and then sold to def (Hudson)
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing at a distance in writing
Issue:
Did finance co or H own car?
Nemo dat: R did not own car and could not confer title on H
But exception under Hire Purchase Act 1964 if R was “debtor” 
under hire purchase agreement with finance co
Was there a valid hire purchase agreement?
Maj of HL Held:
Hire purchase contract void; R was not debtor under hire 
purchase agreement within Act
Finance co entitled to car
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing at a distance in writing
Lord Hobhouse emphasised:
Hire purchase agreement referred to contracting party as 
Durlabh Patel
Identity of customer fundamental for finance co under 
consumer credit contract; not simply willing to deal with any 
person
Lord Phillips:
Hire purchase co only intended to deal with specific person 
Durlabh Patel
Thus no contract could be formed between hire purchase co 
and R
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing at a distance in writing
General principle:
Presumption that parties intend to contract with persons 
named in written agreement
Written agreement with named party tends to indicate 
that identity intended to be a term of the contract 
[condition precedent to formation of contract]
Presumption rebuttable though
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing at a distance in writing
King’s Norton Metal Co v Edridge Merrett & Co Ltd
(1897) 14 TLR 98
Facts:
Wallis (R) sent letter to pls to seek quotation for purchase of 
metal
Letter had name Hallam & Co on letterhead
No such firm existed
Pls sent quotation, R made order, goods despatched to R
Price not paid; R sold to defs
Mistake as to identity –parties 
dealing at a distance in writing
Eng CA held:
Contract formed between pls and R
Pls intended to contract with writer of letters
Cundy v Lindsay distinguished because no firm Hallam & 
Co in existence; no intention on part of pls to contract 
specifically and only with Hallam & Co 
Mistake as to identity –is law 
satisfactory?
Critique of English case law and approach in Cundy v 
Lindsay :
Unprincipled?
Possible to rationalise case law on basis of principle –it is a 
question of whether the mistaken party intended identity to be a 
term (ie whether the mistaken party intended to only contract 
with person having that identity)
But unsatisfactory from policy perspective?
Compare Shogun per Lord Nicholls (dissent)
Original owner who parts with goods without full payment should 
bear risks
