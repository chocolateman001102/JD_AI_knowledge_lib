Preface to the Tenth Edition
This book has three principal aims. The first is to provide an exposition of the rules that
make up the law of contract. To this end it seeks to describe and to analyse the central
doctrines of the modern law of contract and to explore the principal controversies
associated with these doctrines. It seeks to fulfil this aim through a combination of text,
cases, and materials. The function of the text is both to explain and to evaluate the
principal rules and doctrines of contract law and to provide a commentary on the
leading cases and statutes. The cases chosen for inclusion in the book are the leading
cases on the law of contract. The ‘materials’ consist of statutes, statutory instruments,
re-statements of contract law, extracts from textbooks, and academic articles. Secondly,
the book aims to explore the law of contract in its transactional context. It is not
confined to an analysis of the doctrines that make up the law of contract but extends to
the terms that are to be found in modern commercial contracts and the principles that
are applied by the courts when seeking to interpret these contracts. The third aim is to
explore English contract law in a transnational and comparative perspective. This is not
a book on comparative contract law but it does attempt to take account of documents
such as the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts and the
Principles of European Contract Law.
The book is supported by online resources. The website will be updated annually and
can be accessed at 
www.oup.com/he/mckendrick10e
. The principal purposes of the
website are to provide critical summaries of recent developments in the law and to
provide links to helpful websites where further information can be obtained. The
number of new developments incorporated into this edition is fewer than has typically
been the case in recent years. Without doubt, the most significant new decision is the
decision of the Supreme Court in 
Pakistan International Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times
Travel (UK) Ltd
 
which is discussed in 
Chapters 15
 
and 
20
 
and which has resulted in
extensive re-writing of 
Chapter 18
 
in relation to the scope of lawful act duress. Other
cases of significance include the decision of the Supreme Court in 
Triple Point
Technology Inc
 
v. 
PTT Public Co Ltd
 
(dealing with the interpretation of exclusion
clauses and agreed damages clauses) and the decision of the Privy Council in 
Attorney-
General of the Virgin Islands
 
v. 
Global Water Associates Ltd
 
on remoteness of damage.
The text has been fully updated to incorporate other recent changes in the law and a
short section has been added to take account of the Covid-19 pandemic and the question
whether the effect of the pandemic may be to frustrate contracts.
This edition was completed shortly before my retirement from the University of Oxford
and Lady Margaret Hall. I am grateful to the University and the College for the support
which they have provided to me over the last 21 years (which corresponds with the
lifespan of this book).
I am also grateful to the publishers for their assistance and encouragement at every
stage. Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Rose, and our children, Jenny, Sarah,
Rachel, and Katie; their husbands, AJ, Richard, and Sam; and our grandchildren,
Emma, Alfie, Daniel, Rosalie, James, Alice, Edward, and Thomas for the welcome
combination of their encouragement, support, and distraction from the task of putting
together this new edition. My greatest debt is to my wife, Rose, without whose help and
support, in so many ways, this book would never have been written. This book is
dedicated to her with my love and thanks.
The law is stated on the basis of the information available to me as at 20 September
2021.

Introduction
1.1
 
The Aims of this Book
This book has three principal aims. The first is to provide an exposition of the rules that
make up the law of contract. To this end it seeks to describe and to analyse the central
doctrines of the modern law of contract and to explore the principal controversies
associated with these doctrines. It seeks to fulfil this aim through a combination of text,
cases, and materials. The function of the text is both to explain and to evaluate the
principal rules and doctrines of contract law and to provide a commentary on the
leading cases and statutes. The cases chosen for inclusion in the book are the leading
cases on the law of contract. I have chosen to rely on longer extracts from a smaller
range of cases rather than try to include short extracts from every case that can claim to
have made an important contribution to the development of the law of contract. The
decision to restrict the number of cases was made for two reasons. First, it is important
to allow the judges to speak for themselves. Too great a willingness on the part of an
editor to use cut and paste can create a misleading picture, particularly where the
extract consists of the conclusions reached by the judge without setting out the
reasoning that led him or her to that conclusion. Secondly, it is important that law
students get used to reading cases. The ability to read judgments and to extract from
them the principle that is to be applied to the facts of the case at hand is an important
skill that lawyers must acquire. They will not acquire that skill if their legal education
does not expose them to judgments and instead provides them with books that do all the
editing for them. The ‘materials’ consist of statutes, statutory instruments, restatements
of contract law, extracts from textbooks, and academic articles. I have used the extracts
from academic articles largely for the purpose of illustrating particular points or
different interpretations of a case. It has not been possible, for reasons of space, to
include lengthy extracts from major theoretical writings on the law of contract.
Secondly, the book aims to explore the law of contract in its transactional context. It is
not confined to an analysis of the doctrines that make up the law of contract but extends
to the terms that are to be found in modern commercial contracts and the principles
that are applied by the courts when seeking to interpret these contracts. Many of the
‘rules’ that regulate modern contracts are to be found, not in the rules of law, but in the
terms of the contract itself. The rules of law are often ‘default’ rules, that is to say they
apply unless they have been excluded by the terms of the contract. Many modern
commercial contracts do displace the rules that would otherwise be applicable,
especially in the case of contracts concluded between substantial commercial entities.
These are often substantial documents that make elaborate provision for various
eventualities. It is therefore important to have regard to the standard terms that are to
be found in modern commercial contracts (often referred 
to as ‘boilerplate clauses’). The
book does not attempt to provide detailed guidance on the drafting of contract clauses.
But nor does it ignore drafting issues. On a number of occasions I have included the text
of the clause that was in issue between the parties for the purpose of trying to identify
the issues that can and do confront lawyers in practice. This is particularly so in relation
to the drafting of clauses such as exclusion clauses (see 
Chapter 13
); force majeure
clauses (
12.3.5
); entire agreement clauses (see 
12.3.10
); and agreed damages clauses (see
23.11
). It is important to understand why it is that lawyers insert such clauses into their
contracts and why, in the case of clauses such as exclusions and limitations of liability,
they can be the subject of vigorous negotiation between the parties (or their lawyers).
The third aim is to explore English contract law from a transnational and comparative
perspective. This is not a book on comparative contract law, but it is no longer possible
to ignore the fact that transactions in the modern world are frequently entered into on a
cross-border basis. As the Lord Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on Legal Education
stated in its 
First Report on Legal Education and Training
 
(HMSO, 1996) at para 1.13:
Legal transactions are increasingly international in character. An understanding of the different ways that
civilian lawyers approach common law problems can no longer be regarded as the preserve of a few specialists.
Legal education in England and Wales must be both more European and more international.
It should not, however, be thought that the mere fact that the parties to the contract are
from different jurisdictions has the inevitable consequence that their contract is
regulated by rules that differ from those applicable to purely domestic transactions. The
law affords to contracting parties considerable freedom to choose the law that is to
govern their contract (see further 
12.3.6
), and they will generally select as the applicable
law the law of a nation state (usually, but not always, the domestic law of one of the
parties to the contract). In the ‘choice of law’ stakes English law has done remarkably
well. The volume of international trade that has been done on contracts governed by
English law is enormous. A glance at the law reports will tell you that some of the
leading contract cases have been litigated between parties who had no connection with
England other than the fact that their contract was governed by English law. The
explanation for this undoubtedly lies in this country’s great trading history, which has
been of great profit to the City of London and to English law, if not to other parts of the
United Kingdom. Some commodities markets have had their centres in England and
many standard form commodity contracts are governed by English law. London has also
been, and continues to be, a major centre for international arbitration. However, it can
no longer be assumed that international contracts will continue to be governed
exclusively by the laws of a nation state. Developments have taken place at a number of
different levels.
First, there has been the impact of the period of our membership of the European
Union. European Union law has had a significant impact on the law relating to certain
particular types of contract (especially in the context of public procurement) but its
impact on the general principles of contract law has been relatively small. The most
important development has been the European Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer
Contracts, which was first enacted into English law in the Unfair Terms in Consumer
Contracts Regulations 1994 and is now implemented by Part 2 of the Consumer Rights
Act 2015 (see further 
Chapter 14
 
where some of the leading English decisions decided
under the applicable implementing legislation are discussed in more detail and the
influence of European law on the development of this 
area of law is noted). Other
examples of legislation introduced as a result of our membership of the European Union
include the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (SI
2008/1277); the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional
Charges) Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/3134); and the Consumer Protection (Amendment)
Regulations 2014 (SI 2014/870). However, the impact of EU law will diminish now that
the United Kingdom has left the European Union.
At the second level we have internationally agreed conventions such as the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (‘the Vienna
Convention’). The Convention has been ratified by most of the major trading nations in
the world but not by the United Kingdom. The Convention is obviously confined to
international contracts for the sale of goods and so is not of general application
throughout the law of contract. But it is nevertheless an extremely significant document
and it has exercised, and will continue to exercise, considerable influence on the
development of the law of contract in various jurisdictions around the world.
At a third level there have been attempts to draft statements of non-binding principles
of contract law. There are two notable examples in this category. The first is the Unidroit
Principles of International Commercial Contracts and the second is the Principles of
European Contract Law. It is important to stress that neither of these documents is
legally binding in the sense that it is intended to be ratified by States and incorporated
into their law. Rather, in the short to medium term these Principles are intended for use
by contracting parties and can be incorporated into their contract as a set of terms or,
possibly, as the applicable law (at least in the case of arbitration). We shall encounter
both sets of Principles at various points in this book.
This introduction is divided into four further parts. Section 
1.2
 
explores the limits of the
subject and in particular the fact that English law does not have a formal definition of a
contract. The third section turns to consider some transactional elements of contract
law. The fourth section moves on to consider the possible development of an
international contract law. The final section consists of a brief examination of some of
the conflicting policies that can be seen at work in the law of contract.
1.2
 
The Scope of the Law of Contract
English law has no formal definition of a contract. In the absence of a Code it has not
needed one. Textbook writers frequently commence their books with a definition of the
law of contract, but the definition is not part of the law itself. Such definitions are
indicative or illustrative; they do not purport to be definitive or comprehensive. Two
examples suffice to illustrate the point. First, the opening chapter of 
Anson’s Law of
Contract
 
(31st edn, Oxford University Press, 2020, J Beatson, A Burrows, and J
Cartwright (eds)), pp. 1–2 states that:
[t]he law of contract may be provisionally described as that branch of the law which determines the
circumstances in which a promise shall be legally binding on the person making it.
The tentative nature of this statement can be seen from the fact that it is expressly stated
to be ‘provisional’ and it does not attempt to explain why it is that the law regards some
promises as legally binding and others not. A second example is provided by 
Treitel on
The Law 
of Contract
 
(edited by Edwin Peel, 15th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020), which
begins with the following words:
A contract is an agreement giving rise to obligations which are enforced or recognised by law. The factor which
distinguishes contractual from other legal obligations is that they are based on the agreement of the contracting
parties.
Treitel notes that, while this proposition ‘remains generally true’, it is subject to ‘a
number of important qualifications’. First, the law is ‘often concerned with the objective
appearance, rather than the actual fact, of agreement’ (see further 
Chapter 2
). Secondly,
the proposition that contractual obligations are based on agreement must be qualified
because ‘contracting parties are normally expected to observe certain standards of
behaviour’ so that, for example, terms are implied into many contracts as a matter of law
rather than as a product of the agreement of the parties (see further 
Chapter 10
).
Thirdly, the idea that contractual obligations are based on agreement must be qualified
‘in relation to the scope of the principle of freedom of contract’. For example, the judges
and Parliament have, in recent years, qualified the scope of the principle of freedom of
contract in an attempt to protect the weaker party to a contract.
The lack of an agreed definition of a contract is a product of the way in which contract
law in England has evolved. English contract law is unusual in that it did not develop
from some underlying theory or conception of a contract but rather developed around a
form of action known as the action of assumpsit. What mattered was the procedure, or
the form of action, not the substance of the claim. With the abolition of the forms of
action by the Common Law Procedure Act 1852, the grip of procedural considerations
over substantive law began to decline. At about the same time the practice of writing
treatises on the law of contract began to increase and the authors of these texts sought to
rationalize the existing mass of case-law in principled terms. In so doing they relied
heavily on the works of continental jurists (see generally AWB Simpson, ‘Innovation in
Nineteenth Century Contract Law’ (1975) 91 
LQR
 
247). The outcome of this process was
a number of influential books, written most notably by Sir Frederick Pollock and Sir
William Anson, which sought to set out the general principles of the law of contract.
While these authors succeeded in establishing a series of general principles that
commanded almost universal acceptance it was still not necessary to frame a precise
definition of a contract.
While there is no universally agreed definition of a contract, the basic principles of the
law of contract can be set out with a large degree of certainty. To conclude a contract the
parties must reach agreement, the agreement must be supported by consideration, and
there must be an intention to create legal relations. The courts generally decide whether
an agreement has been reached by looking for an offer made by one party to the other,
which has been accepted by that other party: the acceptance, if it is to count, must be a
mirror image of the offer (see 
Chapter 3
). The rule that the agreement must be
supported by consideration perhaps requires further explanation. The doctrine of
consideration is a distinctive, if somewhat elusive, feature of English contract law (see
further 
Chapter 5
). The essence of consideration is that something must be given in
return for a promise in order to render that promise enforceable. It does not matter how
much has been given in return for the promise; that is a matter for the parties to decide.
All that matters is that 
something
 
the law recognizes as being of value has been given.
Thus if I agree to sell my house for £1, that is an enforceable promise because it is
supported by consideration. On the other hand, a promise to give you 
my house for
nothing is not enforceable, unless contained in a deed (on which see 
6.3
). In essence
therefore the law of contract does not enforce gratuitous promises, although it will
occasionally provide protection for a party who has acted to his detriment upon a
gratuitous promise via the doctrine of estoppel (see 
5.3
). While the doctrine of
consideration has excited considerable academic interest, it gives rise to few practical
problems because it can be avoided either by the provision of nominal consideration or
by including the promise in a deed (see further 
6.3
). The requirement that there be an
intention to create legal relations similarly gives rise to few practical problems. This is
because there is a heavy presumption in a commercial context that the parties intended
to create legal relations. The function of the doctrine is, essentially, to keep the law of
contract out of domestic and social relations (see further 
Chapter 7
).
The scope of the contract is generally limited to the parties to it, unless the contracting
parties agree to confer a right to enforce a term of the contract on a third party and that
agreement satisfies the requirements of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
The 1999 Act has made a significant change to the shape of English contract law in that,
prior to its enactment, the general rule was that a third party could neither take the
benefit of, nor be subject to a burden by, a contract to which he was not a party. This is
the doctrine of privity of contract. The rule has been heavily modified in relation to the
ability of contracting parties to confer rights of action upon third parties, but the 1999
Act has not altered the general rule that a third party cannot be subjected to a burden by
a contract to which he is not a party.
The law also polices the terms of contracts and the procedures by which a contract is
concluded. Thus a contract may be set aside where it has been entered into under a
fundamental mistake (
Chapter 16
); where it has been procured by a misrepresentation
(
Chapter 17
), duress (
Chapter 18
), or undue influence (
Chapter 19
); where its object or
method of performance is illegal or contrary to public policy (see the online resources
which support this book); or where an event occurs after the making of the contract
which renders performance impossible, illegal, or something radically different from
that which was in the contemplation of the parties at the time of entry into the contract
(
Chapter 21
). Assuming that a valid contract has been made, a failure to perform an
obligation under the contract without a lawful excuse is a breach of contract (
Chapter
22
). A breach of contract gives to the innocent party a claim for damages, the aim of
which is to put the innocent party in the position in which he would have been had the
contract been performed according to its terms (
Chapter 23
). Where the breach is of an
important term of the contract the innocent party may also be entitled to terminate
further performance of the contract without incurring any liability for doing so (
Chapter
22
). But the law does not generally require the party in breach to perform his obligations
under the contract: specific performance is an exceptional remedy, not the primary
remedy (
Chapter 24
). The law is committed to give a money substitute for performance,
not performance itself.
Two points should be noted about this outline. The first is that it purports to be of
general application; that is to say the propositions outlined purport to be applicable to
all contracts and not just to some. In this sense they claim to be of general application.
This claim must not be taken too seriously. The reality today is that many contracts are
the subject of specific regulation, so that the general principles of the law of contract are
either excluded or are of limited significance. Thus employment contracts, contracts
between landlords and tenants, contracts of marriage, and consumer credit contracts
are the subject of distinct regulation. While this regulation builds on the foundation laid
by the general principles of the law of contract, the detailed rules applicable to these
contracts depart from the general principles in significant respects. This book does not
purport to deal with the law relating to specific 
contracts, such as contracts of
employment. That must be left to specialist textbooks. The aim of this book is to provide
a foundation for the study of the law of particular contracts by examining the principles
that are applicable to all contracts, unless they have been excluded.
The second point to note about this outline is that it would generally be recognized by
authors of contract textbooks in the late nineteenth century. The formal structure of the
law has not changed a great deal. There is less emphasis on matters such as contractual
capacity (discussed in more detail in the online resources which support this book) and
requirements of form (
Chapter 6
) but Sir William Anson, who published the first edition
of his book on contract law in 1879, would not have dissented a great deal from the
outline given earlier (with, perhaps, the exception of the law relating to third party
rights of action). A feature of the development of English contract law is that the pace of
change has generally been slow: English law favours incremental rather than
revolutionary change.
The gradual nature of the change should not, however, be allowed to hide the extent of
the changes that have taken place. Some, such as Professor Hugh Collins (see 
The Law
of Contract
 
(4th edn, Butterworths, 2003)), have argued that the law of contract has
undergone a transformation from the ideals of the classical law of contract set out by
Anson and others. Any such transformation is not reflected in the formal doctrines of
the law of contract. Freedom of contract and freedom from contract remain the
underlying norms, and doctrines such as consideration (but not privity) remain as
central doctrines of the law of contract. Nevertheless, significant changes have taken
place. The modern law of contract pays more overt attention to the fairness of the
bargain (both in procedural and substantive terms) than did the law in the nineteenth
century. Thus doctrines such as economic duress (see 
18.4
) and undue influence (see
Chapter 19
) flourished in the last quarter of the twentieth century. Statute has
intervened more widely to regulate the fairness of the bargain (see, for example, Part 2
of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (
Chapter 14
), the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (see
13.3
), and the Consumer Credit Act 2006). The commitment to freedom from contract
(that is to say the principle that, as long as a contract has not been concluded, the parties
are free to withdraw from negotiations without incurring liability for doing so) has also
been eroded. The extent of the departure is not at first sight apparent. English law still
refuses to recognize the existence of a duty to negotiate with reasonable care, nor does it
formally recognize a doctrine of good faith in the context of the negotiation of contracts
(see 
Chapter 15
). But careful examination of recent cases demonstrates that the courts
have been able to place not insignificant limits on the ability of parties to withdraw from
negotiations without incurring any liability for doing so. They have done so largely by
drawing upon doctrines from outside the law of contract by, for example, imposing a
restitutionary obligation to pay for work done in anticipation of a contract which does
not materialize (see, for example, 
British Steel Corporation
 
v. 
Cleveland Bridge and
Engineering Co Ltd
 
[1984] 1 All ER 504, 
3.3.1
). Occasionally, the courts have been able,
by a benevolent interpretation of the facts, to find that those who appear to be
negotiating parties have in fact concluded a contract (see, for example, 
Blackpool and
Fylde Aero Club Ltd
 
v. 
Blackpool Borough Council
 
[1990] 1 WLR 1195, 
3.2.3
). Via such
covert means the courts have been able to give the appearance that formal contract
doctrine has not changed. The reality is otherwise. There can be little doubt that
freedom from contract has been whittled away to the extent that the law should now
consider whether it has reached the point where it ought to recognize openly what it
appears to be doing surreptitiously, namely recognize that negotiating parties can, in
some circumstances, be subject to a duty to exercise reasonable care or to act in good
faith.
The subtle, incremental nature of the changes that have taken place is important. It
raises the question of the extent of the changes that have taken place in the law of
contract and 
the impact that these changes should have on the structure of the law. It
would be possible to organize a book around the ideals or principles that are said to
influence the modern law of contract and thus give greater emphasis to ideas such as
fairness, co-operation, and autonomy. The approach taken in this book is more
conservative. It adheres to the formal structure of the law that we have inherited from
our predecessors (both judicial and academic) but at the same time endeavours to
reflect the nature of the changes that are taking place both in terms of contract doctrine
(for example, the increasing significance of doctrines such as duress (
Chapter 18
) and
undue influence (
Chapter 19
)) and the questions that have been raised over the future of
the doctrine of consideration (
Chapter 5
) and in relation to the content of modern
contracts (see 
Chapter 12
).
1.3
 
Transactions
To my knowledge there has been no attempt to engage in a systematic analysis of
contract forms and styles of drafting in use in this country. One must therefore proceed
largely by way of impression. Two points seem worthy of comment by way of
introduction.
The first is the growth in the use of standard form contracts. Standard form contracts
assume different forms (see, for example, the judgment of Lord Diplock in 
A Schroeder
Music Publishing Co Ltd
 
v. 
Macaulay
 
[1974] 1 WLR 1308). These standard forms may
be industry wide, an example being the JCT contracts which are in wide use within the
construction industry. These contract forms perform useful functions in so far as they
lay down industry-accepted standards which save valuable negotiation time. And they
give rise to few legal problems, apart from difficulties of interpretation and these depend
largely on the quality of the drafting of the contract form itself. Standard form contracts
produced by individual businesses have given rise to greater legal difficulties. In the case
of inter-business transactions, the use of standard terms of business has given rise to
‘battles of the forms’ as each business seeks to ensure that its standard terms prevail in
the transactions which it concludes (on which see 
3.3.1
). Standard form contracts under
which businesses seek to impose their terms upon consumers have given rise to greater
problems because these terms can be one-sided. A particular problem has been the
sweeping exclusion clauses which these contracts frequently contain. The common law
largely failed to deal with this problem. Lord Denning did his best but he could not
persuade his colleagues to give themselves the power to strike down unreasonable
exclusion clauses (see 
13.1
). Although the courts were sometimes able to protect the
weaker party by applying stringent rules of interpretation (see 
13.2
) or by refusing to
incorporate the exclusion clause into the contract (see 
Chapter 9
), the general picture
was one of the impotence of the common law. Instead it was left to Parliament to
intervene to control the excesses of these standard form contracts. Parliament was slow
to intervene. It was not until 1977 that it found the time to enact the Unfair Contract
Terms Act 1977, and even then it was via a private member’s Bill. Consumers have
recently been given greater protection, courtesy of Europe. Part 2 of the Consumer
Rights Act 2015, the origin of which can be traced back to a European Directive, gives
consumers much broader protection from unfair terms in contracts (see 
Chapter 14
).
The law has finally adjusted to the existence of these standard form contracts. But it has
done so slowly and it may continue to evolve.
The second point to note is that the form and the content of modern contracts have
become increasingly complex. Contracts today often include a vast array of clauses
which seek to provide for various eventualities which may have an impact upon the
performance of 
the contract. Some of these clauses are designed to take away rights
which the law would otherwise give, as in the case of exclusion and limitation clauses
(see 
Chapter 13
) and entire agreement clauses (see 
12.3.10
). Other clauses are a
response to the perceived rigidities of the common law. The common law has generally
set its face against court adjustment of contract terms and is reluctant to conclude that
hardship can discharge a contract: to meet this problem parties have included within
their contracts complex hardship and force majeure clauses which enable the contract to
be adjusted, suspended, or terminated in the event of hardship or the dislocation of
performance (see 
12.3.9
). Some clauses are examples of attempts to exploit
opportunities which the common law affords, as in the case of retention of title clauses
(see 
12.3.2
) and agreed damages clauses (see 
23.11
). It is no easy matter to draft these
clauses. On the one hand, they must be wide enough in order to achieve their purpose
but on the other hand they must not be over-broad because then they may fall foul of
legislative or judicial controls over the content of clauses (for example, in the case of
exclusion clauses see the powers given to the courts under the Unfair Contract Terms
Act 1977, 
13.3
).
1.4
 
Transnational Contract Law
It is important to see these transactions in their international context. While the law of
contract is often described in national terms (so that the focus of this book is principally
upon the English law of contract), transactions are not confined by national borders.
The increase in significance of cross-border transactions has led to calls for the creation
of a law of contract which can straddle national borders. The most significant
development over the last forty to fifty years was our membership of the European
Union, which until our departure from the EU provided a legal framework within which
it was possible to regulate aspects of the law of contract across the different Member
States (in particular in relation to contracts to which consumers are a party). An
alternative approach to the development of a suitable framework for transnational
transactions is the formulation of uniform rules or principles that do not have the force
of law but can nevertheless be adopted by contracting parties. In this connection the
Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts assume considerable
significance. What are the aims of such a document? The Preamble to the Unidroit
Principles states:
These Principles set forth general rules for international commercial contracts.
They shall be applied when the parties have agreed that their contract be governed by them.
They may be applied when the parties have agreed that their contract be governed by general principles of
law, the 
lex mercatoria
 
or the like.
They may be applied when the parties have not chosen any law to govern their contract.
They may be used to interpret or supplement international uniform law instruments.
They may be used to interpret or supplement domestic law.
They may serve as a model for national and international legislators.
Three points are worth noting about the Unidroit Principles. First, they are not legally
binding. They are intended for incorporation into contracts by contracting parties. The
type of situation in which use may be made of the Principles is the case where parties
who come from different parts of the world cannot agree upon which law is to govern
their contract. 
In such a case they may agree to use the Principles as a set of neutral
terms. While the parties can incorporate the Principles as a set of contract terms, they
may not be able to incorporate them into the contract as the applicable law. Within
Europe, parties to litigation must choose the law of a nation state as the applicable law
(see 
12.3.6
) so that the choice of the Principles will take effect subject to the national law
that is found to be applicable to the contract applying the usual conflict of law rules.
Secondly, the Principles may possibly have a role to play when developing national rules
of contract law. To date the English courts have not made use of the Principles in this
way. But this may change (and the Unidroit Principles, together with the Principles of
European Contract Law, are cited at various points in this book when seeking to
consider whether English law should develop in a different direction). Thirdly, the
Principles may have an important role to play in terms of the development of a common
understanding of the basic rules and principles of the law of contract which may in time
lead to the development of an international code of contract law (although it has to be
said that the likelihood of such a Code being developed and agreed in the near future is
extremely remote).
1.5
 
Conflicting Policies
The aim of this final section is to sketch out some of the conflicting policies that
underpin the law of contract. The classical law of contract is based upon freedom of
contract and sanctity of contract; that is to say it is up to the parties to decide for
themselves the terms of their contract and the task of the court is to give effect to the
agreement that the parties have reached. But the law of contract was never committed to
freedom of contract to the exclusion of all other policies. The law has always had a
concern for the fairness of the bargain and the protection of the weak. Thus children
have very little contractual capacity and the courts have refused to enforce contracts that
are illegal. In the former case the demands of freedom of contract give way to the need
to protect the inexperienced and the vulnerable, whereas in the case of illegal contracts
freedom of contract has to bow to broader public policy considerations. The law
attempts to strike a balance between the conflicting demands of freedom of contract, on
the one hand, and fairness on the other hand. These conflicting policies have been
labelled ‘market-individualism’ and ‘consumer-welfarism’ by Professors Adams and
Brownsword. The following extract sets out the essence of these two policies. It also
draws on cases that will be discussed at later points in the book. The reason for
including this extract at this stage in the book is to convey the general idea that
conflicting policies are at work in the law of contract. The aim is not to descend into the
details of that conflict and its resolution.

CONTRACT LAW’

I The Ideologies of the Contract Rule-Book
There is an important academic debate about just where the boundaries of the law of contract lie, about
which mix of statutes and cases constitutes the law of contract. Functionalists will argue that the law of
contract is about the regulation of agreements, and so any legal materials concerned with the regulation
of agreements should belong within the law of contract. 
Traditionalists, however, take a narrower view,
the view implicit in the standard contract textbooks. Here, a well-known litany of cases (together with a
few statutes), organized in a very similar way from one book to another, is taken to represent the law of
contract. Without entering into this debate, let us follow the narrower view and assume that the contract
rule-book comprises just those materials which traditionalists take for the law of contract.
Our contention, as we have said, is that these materials are to be interpreted in the light of two basic
ideologies, Market-Individualism and Consumer-Welfarism. Accordingly, we devote this part of the article
to mapping out the salient features of these two contractual ideologies, and to illustrating their linkage to
particular doctrines and ideas current in the contract rule-book.
1.
 
Market-Individualism
The ideology of Market-Individualism has both market and individualistic strands. The strands are
mutually supportive, but it aids exposition to separate them. We can look first at the market side of this
ideology and then at its individualistic aspect.
(1)
 
The market ideology
According to Market-Individualism, the market place is a site for competitive exchange. The function of
contract is not simply to facilitate exchange, it is to facilitate 
competitive
 
exchange. Contract establishes
the ground rules within which competitive commerce can be conducted. Thus, subject to fraud, mistake,
coercion and the like, bargains made in the market must be kept. In many ways, the line drawn between
(actionable) misrepresentation and mere non-disclosure, epitomizes this view. There are minimal
restraints on contractors: the law of the market is not the law of the jungle, and this rules out
misrepresentations. However, non-disclosure of some informational advantage is simply prudent
bargaining—contractors are involved in a competitive situation and cannot be expected to disclose their
hands. In line with these assumptions, the market-individualist philosophy attaches importance to the
following considerations.
First, security of transactions is to be promoted. This means that where a party, having entered the
market, reasonably assumes that he has concluded a bargain, then that assumption should be
protected. This interest in security of contract receives doctrinal recognition in the objective approach to
contractual intention, the traditional caution with respect to subjective mistake, and the protection of third
party purchasers. Ideally, of course, security of transactions means that a party gets the performance he
has bargained for, but, as the market reveals an increasing number of transactions where performance
is delayed, the opportunities for non-performance increase. To protect the innocent party, contract
espouses the expectation measure of damages (it is the next best thing to actual performance), and in
the principle of sanctity of contract (which we will consider under the individualistic side of Market-
Individualism) it takes a hard line against excuses for non-performance.
Secondly, it is important for those who enter into the market to know where they stand. This means
that the ground rules of contract should be clear. Hence, the restrictions on contracting must not only be
minimal (in line with the competitive nature of the market), but also must be clearly defined (in line with
the market demand for predictability, calculability etc). The postal acceptance rule is a model for Market-
Individualism in the sense that it is clear, simple, and not hedged around with qualifications which leave
contractors constantly unsure of their position. Similarly, the traditional classification approach to
withdrawal encapsulates all the virtues of certainty, which are dear to Market-Individualism.
Thirdly, since contract is concerned essentially with the facilitation of market operations, the law
should accommodate commercial practice, rather than the other way round. Deference to commercial
practice is evident in the market-individualist doctrine of incorporation of terms by reasonable notice, as
it is in the 
Hillas
 
v. 
Arcos
 
[
4.1
] approach to certainty of terms and the re-alignment of the law in 
The
(i)
(ii)
Eurymedon
 
[
25.3.4
]. Also, we should not overlook the import of the commonplace that many of the rules
concerning formation (e.g. the rules determining whether a display of goods is an offer or an invitation to
treat) simply hinge on convenience. This may well be a statement of the obvious, but the obvious should
never be neglected. Contract’s concern to avoid market inconvenience is a measure of its commitment
to the market-individualist policy of facilitating market dealing.
(2)
 
The individualistic ideology
A persistent theme in Market-Individualism is that judges should play a non-interventionist role with
respect to contracts. This distinctive non-interventionism derives from the individualistic side of the
ideology. The essential idea is that parties should enter the market, choose their fellow-contractors, set
their own terms, strike their bargains and stick to them. The linchpins of this individualistic philosophy are
the doctrines of ‘freedom of contract’ and ‘sanctity of contract’.
The emphasis of freedom of contract is on the parties’ freedom of choice. First, the parties should be
free to choose one another as contractual partners (i.e. partner-freedom). Like the tango, contract takes
two. And, ideally the two should consensually choose one another. Secondly, the parties should be free
to choose their own terms (i.e. term-freedom). Contract is competitive, but the exchange should be
consensual. Contract is about unforced choice.
In practice, of course, freedom of contract has been considerably eroded. Anti-discrimination statutes
restrict partner-freedom; and term-freedom has been restricted by both the common law (e.g. in its
restrictions on illegal contracts) and by statute (e.g. the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977—UCTA) [
13.3
].
Moreover, the development of monopolistic enterprises, in the public and private sector alike, has made
it impossible for the weaker party actually to exercise the freedoms in many cases. For example, if one
wants a British family car, a railway ride, telephone services etc. the other contractual partner is virtually
self-selecting. Similarly, where the other side is a standard form or a standard price contractor, the
consumer has no say in setting the terms. Nevertheless, none of this should obscure the thrust of the
principle of freedom of contract, which is that one should have the freedoms, and that the law should
restrict them as little as possible—indeed, it is consistent with the principle (in a widely held view) that
the law should facilitate the freedoms by striking down monopolies.
Although the principle of partner-freedom still has some life in it (e.g. in defending the shopkeeper’s
choice of customer), it is the principle of term-freedom which is the more vital. Term-freedom can be
seen as having two limbs:
The free area within which the parties are permitted, in principle, to set their own terms should be
maximized; and,
Parties should be held to their bargains, i.e. to their agreed terms (provided that the terms fall
within the free area).
…
The second limb of term-freedom is none other than the principle of sanctity of contract. By providing
that parties should be held to their bargains, the principle of sanctity of contract has a double emphasis.
First, if parties must be held to their bargains, they should be treated 
as masters of their own bargains,
and the courts should not indulge in ad hoc adjustment of terms which strike them as unreasonable or
imprudent. Secondly, if parties must be held to their bargains, then the courts should not lightly relieve
contractors from performance of their agreements. It will be appreciated that, while freedom of contract
is the broader of the two principles, it is sanctity of contract which accounts for the distinctive market-
individualistic stand against paternalistic intervention in particular cases.

(7)
The law is littered with examples of the principle of sanctity of contract in operation. It is the
foundation for such landmarks as the doctrine that the courts will not review the adequacy of
consideration; the principle that the basis of implied terms is necessity not reasonableness; the hard-line
towards unilateral ‘collateral’ mistake, common mistake and frustration; the cautious reception of
economic duress; the anxiety to limit the doctrine of inequality of bargaining power; the resistance to the
citation of relatively unimportant uncertainty as a ground for release from a contract and the reluctance
to succumb to arguments of economic waste or unreasonableness as a basis for release from a bargain.
The principle of sanctity of contract is a thread which runs through contract from beginning to end,
enjoining the courts to be ever-vigilant in ensuring that established or new doctrines do not become an
easy exit from bad bargains.
2.
 
Consumer-Welfarism
The consumer-welfarist ideology stands for a policy of consumer-protection, and for principles of fairness
and reasonableness in contract. It does not start with the market-individualist premise that all contracts
should be minimally regulated. Rather, it presupposes that consumer contracts are to be closely
regulated, and that commercial contracts, although still ordinarily to be viewed as competitive
transactions, are to be subject to rather more regulation than Market-Individualism would allow. The
difficulties with Consumer-Welfarism appear as soon as one attempts to identify its particular guiding
principles (i.e. its operative principles and conceptions of fairness and reasonableness).
Without attempting to draw up an exhaustive list of the particular principles of Consumer-Welfarism,
we suggest that the following number amongst its leading ideas:
The principle of constancy: parties should not ‘blow hot and cold’ in their dealings with one
another, even in the absence of a bargain. A person should not encourage another to act in a
particular way or to form a particular expectation (or acquiesce in another’s so acting or forming
an expectation) only then to act inconsistently with that encouragement (or acquiescence). …
The principle of proportionality: an innocent party’s remedies for breach should be proportionate
to the seriousness of the consequences of the breach. … We can also see this principle at work
in regulating contractual provisions dealing with the amount of damages. Thus, penalty clauses
are to be rejected because they bear no relationship to the innocent party’s real loss (they are
disproportionately excessive) and exemption clauses are unreasonable because they err in the
opposite direction.
The principle of bad faith: a party who cites a good legal principle in bad faith should not be
allowed to rely on that principle. …
The principle that no man should profit from his own wrong:…
The principle of unjust enrichment: no party, even though innocent, should be allowed unfairly to
enrich himself at the expense of another. Accordingly, it is unreasonable for an innocent party to
use another’s breach as an opportunity for unfair enrichment: hence, again, the prohibition on
penalty clauses, the anxiety about the use made of cost of 
performance damages, and perhaps
the argument in 
White & Carter
 
[
22.6
] which (unsuccessfully) pleaded the unreasonableness of
continued performance. Equally, frustration should not entail unfair financial advantage.
The better loss-bearer principle: where a loss has to be allocated to one of two innocent parties, it
is reasonable to allocate it to the party who is better able to carry the loss. As a rule of thumb,
commercial parties are deemed to be better loss-bearers than consumers.
The principle of exploitation: a stronger party should not be allowed to exploit the weakness of
another’s bargaining situation; but parties of equal bargaining strength should be assumed to
(8)
(9)
(10)
(11)
have a non-exploitative relationship. The first part of this principle, its positive interventionist
aspect, pushes for a general principle of unconscionability, and justifies the policy of consumer-
protection. The latter (qualifying) aspect of the principle, however, is equally important, for it
invites a non-interventionist approach to commercial contracts.
The principle of a fair deal for consumers: consumers should be afforded protection against sharp
advertising practice, against misleading statements, against false representations, and against
restrictions on their ordinary rights. Moreover, consumer disappointment should be properly
compensated.
The principle of informational advantage: representors who have special informational advantage
must stand by their representations; but representees who have equal informational opportunity
present no special case for protection. The positive aspect of the principle of informational
advantage is protective, but its negative aspect offers no succour to representees who are judged
able to check out statements for themselves.
The principle of responsibility for fault: contractors who are at fault should not be able to avoid
responsibility for their fault. This principle threatens both exemption clauses which deal with
negligence; and indemnity clauses which purport to pass on the risk of negligence liability.
The paternalistic principle: contractors who enter into imprudent agreements may be relieved
from their bargains where justice so requires. The case for paternalistic relief is at its most
compelling where the party is weak or naïve. Although the consumer-welfarist line on common
mistake and frustration suggests a general concern to cushion the effects of harsh bargains, it is
an open question to what extent Consumer-Welfarism would push the paternalistic principle for
the benefit of commercial contractors.
As we have seen, some of these ideas can generate novel doctrines such as equitable estoppel and
unconscionability. However, Consumer-Welfarism also attempts to feed reasonableness into such
existing contractual categories as implied terms, mistake, and frustration (thereby opening the door to
the employment of the particular principles of the ideology). Whilst Lord Denning’s attempts to make
such a move in respect of implied terms and frustration have failed, the equitable doctrine of common
mistake continues to enjoy support [that support has since been withdrawn, see 
16.5
]. The most
spectacular doctrinal success, however, has been with exemption clauses which are, of course,
generally regulated now under a regime of reasonableness by UCTA.
Consumer-Welfarism suffers from its pluralistic scheme of principles. Where a dispute clearly falls
under just one of its principles, there is no difficulty; but, as soon as more than one principle is relevant,
there is potentially a conflict. Without a rigid hierarchy of principles, the outcome of such conflicts will be
unpredictable, as different judges will attach different weights to particular principles. It follows that
Consumer-Welfarism is unlikely ever to attain the unity and consistency of its market-individualist rival.

Agreement: Objective or Subjective?
Central Issues
When deciding whether or not parties have in fact reached agreement
the law could either seek to examine the subjective intentions of the
parties or it could have regard to their intention, objectively
ascertained.
English law has chosen to adopt an objective approach. The reasons
for this choice will be examined in this chapter, together with the
different forms that the objective test can take. It will be suggested
that the approach adopted by the judges is to attempt to put
themselves in the position of a reasonable person in the position of
the parties (principally, but not exclusively, the promisee of the
disputed promise). The judges do not adopt the perspective of the
reasonable detached observer.
Finally the chapter concludes by considering whether or not the law
adopts a subjective approach in the case where one party attempts to
‘snap up’ an offer which he knew that the offeror did not intend and in
the case where one party was at fault in failing to notice that the other
party’s offer contained a mistake, or he was himself responsible for
inducing that mistake in the other party. The conclusion that will be
reached is that it is not necessary to resort to a subjective approach in
order to explain these cases, and that they can be analysed in terms
consistent with the objective test that is generally applied by the
courts.
2.1
 
Introduction
A party who wishes to establish that a legally binding contract has been formed between
himself and another party must prove a number of matters. The first is that the parties
have reached agreement. This is usually done by demonstrating that one party has made
an offer that the other has accepted. The rules relating to offer and acceptance are
discussed in 
Chapter 3
. Secondly, the agreement must be expressed in a form that is
sufficiently certain for the court to be able to enforce. The tests applied by the courts
when deciding whether a term has been expressed in a form that is too vague,
incomplete, or uncertain to be enforced 
are discussed in 
Chapter 4
. Thirdly, the
agreement must be supported by consideration (although it is possible that effect may
be given to a promise that is unsupported by consideration via an estoppel). The
doctrine of consideration and the role that estoppel can play in giving effect to promises
that are unsupported by consideration are discussed in 
Chapter 5
. Fourthly, the law may
only recognize the validity of the agreement if it is entered into in a particular form
(such as writing). The significance of requirements of form has diminished in recent
years but they have not been entirely abolished. Requirements of form are discussed in
Chapter 6
. Finally, the parties must have had an intention to create legal relations. This
intention is presumed in commercial transactions, but in the case of domestic and social
agreements the law initially presumes that the parties did not intend to be legally bound
by their agreement. The doctrine of intention to create legal relations is discussed in
Chapter 7
.
The function of this chapter is to discuss a preliminary matter, namely the approach
adopted by the courts when seeking to ascertain the intention of the parties. Many of the
rules of contract law are said to rest on the intention of the parties. But how does the
court ascertain their intention? Does it seek to examine the actual, subjective state of
mind of the parties or does it look to the outward manifestation of their intention (as
expressed in the words used, their appearance, conduct, etc.)? The general rule is that
the existence and content of an agreement are objective questions that must be
answered by reference to the intention of the parties, objectively ascertained. As Lord
Clarke observed in the Supreme Court in 
RTS Flexible Systems Ltd
 
v. 
Molkerei Alois
Müller GmbH & Co KG (UK Production)
 
[2010] UKSC 14, [2010] 1 WLR 753, [45]:
whether there is a binding contract between the parties and, if so, upon what terms
depends upon what they have agreed. It depends not upon their subjective state of
mind, but upon a consideration of what was communicated between them by words or
conduct, and whether that leads objectively to a conclusion that they intended to create
legal relations and had agreed upon all the terms which they regarded or the law
requires as essential for the formation of legally binding relations.
The proposition that the test for the existence and content of an agreement is objective
rather than subjective raises three issues. The first relates to the justification for the
adoption of an objective approach. If contract is about the enforcement of promises
voluntarily made, why does the law not place primary emphasis on the subjective
intentions of the parties? The reasons for the adoption of an objective approach are,
essentially, the need to encourage certainty in commercial transactions and the desire to
avoid the evidential difficulties associated with an inquiry into the actual state of mind
of a party to the contract. Lord Steyn, writing extrajudicially (‘Contract Law: Fulfilling
the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men’ (1997) 113 
LQR
 
433), put the matter as
follows:
It is a defensible position for a legal system to give predominance to the subjective intentions of the parties.
Such a policy can claim to be committed to the ideal of perfect individualised justice. But that is not the English
way. Our law is generally based on an objective theory of contract. This involves adopting an external standard
given life by using the concept of the reasonable man. The commercial advantage of the English approach is that
it promotes certainty and predictability in the resolution of contractual disputes. And, as a matter of principle, it
is not unfair to impute to contracting parties the intention that in the event of a dispute a neutral judge should
decide the case applying an objective standard of reasonableness.
The second issue relates to the definition or the scope of this ‘objective theory of
contract’. Lord Steyn’s definition is a broad one in that it places considerable emphasis
on the concept of ‘reasonableness’ (more than one might, perhaps, expect from a judge
sitting in a court in England). There are in fact different variants of the objective theory
of contract. Howarth (‘The Meaning of Objectivity in Contract’ (1984) 100 
LQR
 
265)
identifies three varieties. The first he terms ‘promisor objectivity’ (that is to say the
promise is to be understood in the way in which it would have been understood by a
reasonable person in the position of the promisor); the second is ‘promisee objectivity’
(according to which the promise is to be understood in the way in which it would have
been understood by a reasonable person in the position of the promisee); and the third
is ‘detached objectivity’ (in which case the perspective adopted is that of the reasonable
man who is independent of the two parties to the contract). Howarth is himself an
advocate of ‘detached objectivity’. The distinction that he draws between ‘promisor’ and
‘promisee’ objectivity is, however, a troublesome one in application because in an
ordinary bilateral contract the parties are both promisors and promisees (for criticism of
Howarth’s analysis along these lines see J Vorster, ‘A Comment on the Meaning of
Objectivity in Contract’ (1987) 103 
LQR
 
274). Thus in the case of a contract for the sale
of goods the seller is a promisor in relation to the promise to sell the goods but a
promisee in relation to the buyer’s promise to pay for them, while the buyer is a
promisor in relation to his promise to pay for the goods but a promisee in relation to the
seller’s promise to deliver the goods. What does Howarth himself mean by the use of the
labels ‘promisor’ and ‘promisee’? He defines his concepts in footnote 5 of his article
where he states:
The use of promisor/promisee terminology, rather than plaintiff/defendant or offeror/offeree, serves as a
convenient means of distinguishing the party wishing to enforce a contract or contractual promise (the
promisee) from the party wishing to avoid the enforcement of that promise (the promisor).
As we shall see (
2.2
, 
2.3
, and 
2.4
), this distinction gives rise to considerable difficulty in
terms of application and should, for that reason, be rejected. Nevertheless, despite these
terminological difficulties, Howarth’s insight is a useful one because it points out that
the objective test can be viewed from different perspectives. Generally, there are two
parties to a contract and the law could adopt the perspective of the reasonable person in
the position of either party to the contract or it could adopt the position of the
reasonable independent observer.
The third issue relates to the role of the subjective intentions of the parties to the
contract. Are they irrelevant (at least to the extent that they do not coincide with the
result reached by the application of the objective test) or do they have some residual
significance? Cases in which it has been argued that the courts have resorted to a
subjective approach are cases in which one party attempts to snap up an offer which she
knows the other party did not intend (see 
Hartog
 
v. 
Colin & Shields
 
[1939] 3 All ER 566,
2.3
) and where one party was at fault in not realizing that the other party had made a
mistake (see 
Scriven Brothers & Co
 
v. 
Hindley & Co
 
[1913] 3 KB 564, 
2.4
). We shall
examine these cases and consider whether they do in fact adopt a subjective approach
after we have discussed two leading cases that consider the scope of the objective test,

The Objective Theory Illustrated
SMITH V. HUGHES
(1871) LR 6 QB 597, Court of Appeal
The facts are set out in the judgment of Cockburn CJ.
Cockburn CJ
This was an action brought in the county court of Surrey, upon a contract for the
sale of a quantity of oats by plaintiff to defendant, which contract the defendant had
refused to complete, on the ground that the contract had been for the sale and
purchase of old oats, whereas the oats tendered by the plaintiff had been oats of
the last crop, and therefore not in accordance with the contract.
The plaintiff was a farmer, the defendant a trainer of racehorses. And it
appeared that the plaintiff, having some good winter oats to sell, had applied to the
defendant’s manager to know if he wanted to buy oats, and having received for
answer that he (the manager) was always ready to buy good oats, exhibited to him
a sample, saying at the same time that he had forty or fifty quarters of the same
oats for sale, at the price of 35s. per quarter. The manager took the sample, and
on the following day wrote to say he would take the whole quantity at the price of
34s. a quarter.
Thus far the parties were agreed; but there was a conflict of evidence between
them as to whether anything passed at the interview between the plaintiff and
defendant’s manager on the subject of the oats being old oats, the defendant
asserting that he had expressly said that he was ready to buy old oats, and that
the plaintiff had replied that the oats were old oats, while the plaintiff denied that
any reference had been made to the oats being old or new.
The plaintiff having sent in a portion of the oats, the defendant, on meeting him
afterwards, said, ‘Why, those were new oats you sent me’, to which the plaintiff
having answered, ‘I knew they were; I had none other’. The defendant replied, ‘I
thought I was buying old oats: new oats are useless to me; you must take them
back’. This the plaintiff refused to do and brought this action.
It was stated by the defendant’s manager that trainers as a rule always use old
oats, and that his own practice was never to buy new oats if he could get old. But
the plaintiff denied having known that the defendant never bought new oats, or that
trainers did not use them; and, on the contrary, asserted that a trainer had recently
offered him a price for new oats. Evidence was given for the defendant that 34s. a
quarter was a very high price for new oats, and such as a prudent man of business
would not have given. On the other hand, it appeared that oats were at the time
very scarce and dear.
The learned judge of the county court left two questions to the jury: first,
whether the word ‘old’ had been used with reference to the oats in the
conversation between the plaintiff and the defendant’s manager; secondly, whether
the plaintiff had believed that the defendant believed, or was under the impression,
that he was contracting for old oats; in either of which cases he directed the jury to
find for the defendant.
It is to be regretted that the jury were not required to give specific answers to
the questions so left to them. For, it is quite possible that their verdict may have
been given for the defendant on the first ground; in which case there could, I think,
be no doubt as to the propriety of the judge’s direction; whereas now, as it is
possible that the verdict of the jury—or at all events of some of them—may have
proceeded on the second ground, we are called 
upon to consider and decide
whether the ruling of the learned judge with reference to the second question was
right.
For this purpose we must assume that nothing was said on the subject of the
defendant’s manager desiring to buy old oats, nor of the oats having been said to
be old; while, on the other hand, we must assume that the defendant’s manager
believed the oats to be old oats, and that the plaintiff was conscious of the
existence of such belief, but did nothing, directly or indirectly, to bring it about,
simply offering his oats and exhibiting his sample, remaining perfectly passive as
to what was passing in the mind of the other party. The question is whether, under
such circumstances, the passive acquiescence of the seller in the self-deception of
the buyer will entitle the latter to avoid the contract. I am of opinion that it will not.
[He set out his reasons and continued]
It only remains to deal with an argument which was pressed upon us, that the
defendant in the present case intended to buy old oats, and the plaintiff to sell new,
so the two minds were not ad idem; and that consequently there was no contract.
This argument proceeds on the fallacy of confounding what was merely a motive
operating on the buyer to induce him to buy with one of the essential conditions of
the contract. Both parties were agreed as to the sale and purchase of this
particular parcel of oats. The defendant believed the oats to be old, and was thus
induced to agree to buy them, but he omitted to make their age a condition of the
contract. All that can be said is, that the two minds were not ad idem as to the age
of the oats; they certainly were ad idem as to the sale and purchase of them.
Suppose a person to buy a horse without a warranty, believing him to be sound,
and the horse turns out unsound, could it be contended that it would be open to
him to say that, as he had intended to buy a sound horse, and the seller to sell an
unsound one, the contract was void, because the seller must have known from the
price the buyer was willing to give, or from his general habits as a buyer of horses,
that he thought the horse was sound? The cases are exactly parallel.
The result is that, in my opinion, the learned judge of the county court was
wrong in leaving the second question to the jury, and that, consequently, the case
must go down to a new trial.
Blackburn J
In this case I agree that on the sale of a specific article, unless there be a warranty
making it part of the bargain that it possesses some particular quality, the
purchaser must take the article he has bought though it does not possess that
quality. And I agree that even if the vendor was aware that the purchaser thought
that the article possessed that quality, and would not have entered into the contract
unless he had so thought, still the purchaser is bound, unless the vendor was
guilty of some fraud or deceit upon him, and that a mere abstinence from
disabusing the purchaser of that impression is not fraud or deceit; for, whatever
may be the case in a court of morals, there is no legal obligation on the vendor to
inform the purchaser that he is under a mistake, not induced by the act of the
vendor …
But I have more difficulty about the second point raised in the case. I
apprehend that if one of the parties intends to make a contract on one set of terms,
and the other intends to make a contract on another set of terms, or, as it is
sometimes expressed, if the parties are not ad idem, there is no contract, unless
the circumstances are such as to preclude one of the parties from denying that he
has agreed to the terms of the other. The rule of law is that stated in 
Freeman
 
v.
Cooke
 
2 Ex 663. If, whatever a man’s real intention may be, he so conducts
himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to the terms
proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the
contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he
had intended to agree to the other party’s terms.
The jury were directed that, if they believed the word ‘old’ was used, they
should find for the defendant—and this was right; for if that was the case, it is
obvious that neither did the defendant intend to enter into a contract on the
plaintiff’s terms, that is, to buy this parcel of oats without any stipulation as to their
quality; nor could the plaintiff have been led to believe he was intending to do so.
But the second direction raises the difficulty. I think that, if from that direction
the jury would understand that they were first to consider whether they were
satisfied that the defendant intended to buy this parcel of oats on the terms that it
was part of his contract with the plaintiff that they were old oats, so as to have the
warranty of the plaintiff to that effect, they were properly told that, if that was so,
the defendant could not be bound to a contract without any such warranty unless
the plaintiff was misled. But I doubt whether the direction would bring to the minds
of the jury the distinction between agreeing to take the oats under the belief that
they were old and agreeing to take the oats under the belief that the plaintiff
contracted that they were old.
The difference is the same as that between buying a horse believed to be
sound, and buying one believed to be warranted sound; but I doubt if it was made
obvious to the jury, and I doubt this the more because I do not see much evidence
to justify a finding for the defendant on this latter ground if the word ‘old’ was not
used. There may have been more evidence than is stated in the case; and the
demeanour of the witnesses may have strengthened the impression produced by
the evidence there was; but it does not seem a very satisfactory verdict if it
proceeded on this latter ground. I agree, therefore, in the result that there should
be a new trial.
Hannen J
[…]
It is essential to the creation of a contract that both parties should agree to the
same thing in the same sense. Thus, if two persons enter into an apparent contract
concerning a particular person or ship, and it turns out that each of them, misled by
a similarity of name, had a different person or ship in his mind, no contract would
exist between them: 
Raffles
 
v. 
Wichelhaus
 
2 H & C 906.
But one of the parties to an apparent contract may, by his own fault, be
precluded from setting up that he had entered into it in a different sense to that in
which it was understood by the other party. Thus in the case of a sale by sample
where the vendor, by mistake, exhibited a wrong sample, it was held that the
contract was not avoided by this error of the vendor: 
Scott
 
v. 
Littledale
 
8 E & B 815.
But if in the last-mentioned case the purchaser, in the course of the
negotiations preliminary to the contract, had discovered that the vendor was under
a misapprehension as to the sample he was offering, the vendor would have been
entitled to shew that he had not intended to enter into the contract by which the
purchaser sought to bind him. The rule of law applicable to such a case is a
corollary from the rule of morality which Mr Pollock [counsel for the plaintiff] cited
from Paley, 
Moral and Political Philosophy
, Book III, ch. V, that a promise is to be
performed ‘in that sense in which the promiser apprehended at the time the
promisee received it’, and may be thus expressed: ‘The promiser is not bound to
fulfil a promise in a sense in which the promisee knew at the time the promiser did
not intend it’. And in considering the question, in what sense a promisee is entitled
to enforce a promise, it matters not in what way the knowledge of the meaning in
which the promiser made it is brought to the mind of the promisee, whether by
express words, or by conduct, or previous dealings, or 
other circumstances. If by
any means he knows that there was no real agreement between him and the
promiser, he is not entitled to insist that the promise shall be fulfilled in a sense to
which the mind of the promiser did not assent.
If, therefore, in the present case, the plaintiff knew that the defendant, in
dealing with him for oats, did so on the assumption that the plaintiff was contracting
to sell him old oats, he was aware that the defendant apprehended the contract in
a different sense to that in which he meant it, and he is thereby deprived of the
right to insist that the defendant shall be bound by that which was only the
apparent, and not the real bargain.
This was the question which the learned judge intended to leave to the jury; … I
do not think it was incorrect in its terms, but I think that it was likely to be
misunderstood by the jury. The jury were asked, ‘whether they were of opinion, on
the whole of the evidence, that the plaintiff believed the defendant to believe, or to
be under the impression that he was contracting for the purchase of old oats? If so,
there would be a verdict for the defendant’. The jury may have understood this to
mean that, if the plaintiff believed the defendant to believe that he was buying old
oats, the defendant would be entitled to the verdict; but a belief on the part of the
plaintiff that the defendant was making a contract to buy the oats, of which he
offered him a sample, under a mistaken belief that they were old, would not relieve
the defendant from liability unless his mistaken belief were induced by some
misrepresentation of the plaintiff, or concealment by him of a fact which it became
his duty to communicate. In order to relieve the defendant it was necessary that
the jury should find not merely that the plaintiff believed the defendant to believe
that he was buying old oats, but that he believed the defendant to believe that he,
the plaintiff, was contracting to sell old oats.
I am the more disposed to think that the jury did not understand the question in
this last sense because I can find very little, if any, evidence to support a finding
upon it in favour of the defendant. It may be assumed that the defendant believed
the oats were old, and it may be suspected that the plaintiff thought he so believed,
but the only evidence from which it can be inferred that the plaintiff believed that
the defendant thought that the plaintiff was making it a term of the contract that the
oats were old is that the defendant was a trainer, and that trainers, as a rule, use
old oats; and that the price given was high for new oats, and more than a prudent
man would have given.
Having regard to the admitted fact that the defendant bought the oats after two
days’ detention of the sample, I think that the evidence was not sufficient to justify
the jury in answering the question put to them in the defendant’s favour, if they
rightly understood it; and I therefore think there should be a new trial.
Commentary
Smith
 
was decided at a time when juries were still in common use in civil disputes. As
Cockburn CJ states in his judgment, the judge left two questions for the jury. Had he
required the jury to answer these questions separately, the appeal to the Court of Appeal
might have been avoided. The jury entered a verdict for the defendant but, as a
consequence of their failure to answer the two questions separately, the plaintiff was
able to secure a new trial because of the possibility that the jury had misunderstood the
second question and had entered judgment for the defendant only as a result of that
misapprehension.
There are two points of importance that emerge from 
Smith
. The first relates to the
scope of the doctrine of mistake. This is a topic to which we shall return in 
Chapter 16
.
Here it suffices to note that the Court of Appeal distinguished between the case where
the plaintiff believed that the defendant thought he was buying old oats and the case
where the 
plaintiff believed that the defendant thought that he was buying oats which
the plaintiff had promised were old. In the former case the defendant is liable to take the
oats and must take the consequences of his own mistake, whereas in the latter he is not
liable to take the oats on the ground that the parties were at cross-purposes as to the
terms of the contract (for a modern affirmation of this rule see 
Statoil ASA
 
v. 
Louis
Dreyfus Energy Services LP
 
[2008] EWHC 2257 (Comm), [2008] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 685).
The second point, and the issue with which we are here concerned, relates to the
submission that the parties were not ‘ad idem’ and that, consequently, no contract had
been concluded between the parties. In considering whether or not the parties had
reached agreement, the Court of Appeal clearly did not adopt a subjective approach
because the fact that the defendant mistakenly believed that the oats were old oats was
not sufficient to persuade the court to hold that no contract had been concluded. So the
court applied an objective approach.
But which variant of the objective test did the Court of Appeal apply? The judgments do
not appear to offer any support for ‘detached objectivity’. Howarth interprets the
judgment of Hannen J as support for ‘promisor objectivity’ and the judgment of
Blackburn J as support for ‘promisee objectivity’ (at (1984) 100 
LQR
 
265, 268, and 271
respectively). But here we encounter the problem, alluded to earlier (see 
2.1
), of the
identification of the ‘promisor’ and the ‘promisee’. The seller was the promisor in
relation to his promise to sell the oats, while the buyer was the promisor in relation to
his promise to pay for them. Was the subject matter of the dispute the buyer’s promise
to pay or the seller’s promise to sell? There is a real sense in which the dispute was about
the buyer’s promise to pay, in that the seller was suing for the price and so was
attempting to enforce the buyer’s promise to pay. But neither the buyer nor the seller
disputed that the buyer had promised to pay for the oats at 34s per quarter. The dispute
between the parties related to the seller’s promise to sell the oats and, in particular, the
buyer’s understanding of that promise. In relation to that promise, the seller was the
promisor and the buyer was the promisee. But it is unlikely that either Blackburn J or
Hannen J thought it necessary to distinguish between ‘promisor objectivity’ on the one
hand and ‘promisee objectivity’ on the other. It seems more likely that they intended to
examine the case from the perspective of the reasonable person in the position of both
parties.
Applied to the facts of 
Smith
 
this approach works out as follows. The seller sues for the
price. The buyer cannot deny that he promised to pay for the oats. But he denies that he
is liable to pay for them because he alleges that the seller promised to sell him old oats.
This focuses attention on the seller’s promise. Does the court attempt to put itself in the
position of the reasonable man in the position of the buyer or the reasonable man in the
position of the seller? It starts with the reasonable man in the position of the buyer (who
is the promisee in relation to the seller’s promise to sell). How would a reasonable man
in the position of the buyer understand the seller’s offer? Assuming that the seller did
not use the word ‘old’ to describe the oats the reasonable man would understand it to be
an offer to sell oats. This being the case, the contract was for the sale of oats and the
buyer was liable to pay the price to the seller. But it does not follow from this that the
court has no concern with the position of the seller (or, more accurately, the reasonable
person in the position of the seller). On the facts of 
Smith
 
the court gave little overt
attention to the position of the seller because the reasonable man in the position of the
seller would understand the buyer’s promise as a promise to buy oats. But suppose that
the seller knew that the buyer had misunderstood the terms of his offer and, further, he
knew that the buyer believed that the seller had offered to sell him old oats. In such a
case the seller would not be entitled to rely on the objective appearance created by the
buyer’s promise to pay for the oats because of his knowledge that the buyer did not
intend to buy the new oats. The law does 
not allow a party to snatch at a bargain which
he knew was not intended (see 
Hartog
 
v. 
Colin & Shields
 
[1939] 3 All ER 566, 
2.3
). This,
indeed, is the point that was made by Hannen J in the context of his quotation from the
work of Paley.
Suppose a further variation of the facts of 
Smith
 
(based on the example given by Hannen
J in the second paragraph of his judgment). Assume that the seller did not in fact intend
to sell oats. He intended to sell barley but took along oats as his sample because he was
unable to distinguish between oats and barley. When he delivers the barley the buyer
refuses to take delivery or to pay for it. Again the buyer does not deny that he promised
to pay for the goods. His defence is that the goods delivered were not those he
contracted to buy. He states that he contracted to buy oats and not barley. The seller
maintains that he intended to sell barley and not oats. So, once again, it is the subject
matter of the seller’s promise that is in dispute. How would a reasonable person in the
position of the buyer understand the seller’s offer? He would understand it as an offer to
sell oats and, this being the case, the buyer would not be liable to pay for the barley. Any
argument by the seller to the effect that he did not intend to offer oats for sale would be
dismissed by the court on the ground that a reasonable person in the position of the
buyer would understand his offer as an offer to sell oats and the seller would be bound
by the appearance created by his conduct.
It is therefore suggested that the court does not have to choose between adopting the
position of the reasonable person in the position of one party or the other. In relation to
the promise, the meaning of which is disputed, the law starts from the position of the
reasonable person in the position of the promisee but it does not stop there. It then goes
on to examine the transaction from the perspective of the reasonable person in the
position of the other party to the contract.

The plaintiffs let premises to the defendants for a term running from 1 December
1978 to 24 December 1989 at a yearly rental of £68,320, payable from 25
December 1978 and subject to a rent review from 25 December 1982. The
agreement between the parties contained the following rent review clause:
PROVIDED ALWAYS and it is hereby agreed that the rent hereby reserved shall on the Twenty-fifth day
of December One thousand nine hundred and eighty-two be increased to the then current market rental
value of the demised premises and in this connection the following procedure shall be adopted namely—
A.
B.
C.
D.
E.
At least six months before the Twenty-fifth day of December One thousand nine hundred and
eighty-two the Lessor and the Lessee or their duly authorised preresentatives (sic) will endeavour
to reach agreement on the then current market rental value of the demised premises and if they
are able to agree such current market rental value within a period of three months they shall
certify the amount of the then current market rental value as agreed between them –
In the event of the parties hereto failing to reach agreement as to the then current market rental
value within the said period of three months by sub-clause A hereof
PROVIDED then the matter shall be referred to an independent surveyor or valuer (to be
appointed within a further period of one month by the President for the time being 
of the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors) for assessment and not by way of arbitration and the
assessment of such independent surveyor shall be communicated to the parties hereto in writing
and shall be final and binding upon them. …
Upon the signing of the Certificate by the duly authorised representative of the Lessor and
Lessee respectively or the receipt by the Lessor and the Lessee of the independent surveyor’s or
valuer’s written communication as to the then current market rental value the rent hereby
reserved shall as from the twenty-fifth day of December One thousand nine hundred and eighty-
two be increased to the amount so certified or assessed
Under no circumstances shall this proviso operate to effect a reduction in the rent below that
which was payable immediately before the particular date of any rent revision hereunder …
On 22 June 1982 a letter was written to the defendants on behalf of the plaintiffs by
their solicitors which invited the defendants to agree that the ‘current market rental
value’ of the premises was £65,000. The defendants’ company secretary replied to
this letter on the following day and he agreed that £65,000 was the appropriate
figure. The plaintiffs received this letter on 28 June and immediately one of their
partners telephoned the defendants to inform them that the letter of 22 June 1982
contained an error and that they had intended to propose a current market rental
value of £126,000, not £65,000. The plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to the defendants in
similar terms on the following day. But the defendants refused to accept the
amended terms and insisted that the parties had concluded a binding agreement
at a rental of £65,000.
The plaintiffs issued a writ against the defendants and sought a declaration that
no legally binding agreement had been made between the parties in respect of the
reviewed rent payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs from 25 December 1982
and a declaration that the plaintiffs were entitled to refer the assessment of the
current market rental value to an independent surveyor or valuer in accordance
with sub-clause B of the rent review clause.
The trial judge held that the plaintiffs were entitled to summary judgment. The
(1)
(2)
defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal who allowed the appeal and gave the
defendants unconditional leave to defend the action.
Slade LJ
[giving the judgment of the court]
The essence of the plaintiffs’ case is, and has at all times been, that the parties
have failed to reach ‘agreement’ as to the ‘current market rental value’ of the
demised premises within the meaning of sub-paragraphs A and B of the rent
review provision and that the plaintiffs are accordingly entitled to have matters
referred to an independent surveyor pursuant to sub-paragraph B. To establish this
claim, it was and is necessary for them to satisfy this Court that the two letters of
the 22nd and 23rd June did not result in the conclusion of any ‘agreement’ within
the meaning of those sub-paragraphs.
So far as their affidavit evidence revealed, the two grounds upon which the
plaintiffs intended to argue the latter proposition were in effect:
that not even an apparent binding agreement was concluded by these two
letters, because, on the true construction of the rent review provision, there
could be no binding agreement until the parties had signed the
contemplated certificate;
that even if the two letters did evidence an apparent binding agreement,
there was in fact no binding agreement in law, on the grounds that the
defendants, in responding as they did to the letter of the 22nd June, were
trying to take advantage of what they knew, or ought reasonably to have
known, was an error on the part of the plaintiffs’ solicitors.
When the Order XIV
 
summons came on for hearing before Mr Justice Harman,
the plaintiffs shifted their position. They did not attempt to pursue the first of these
two points. As to the second, they accepted that there was a substantial disputed
issue of fact as to whether the defendants on the 23rd June 1982, knew, or ought
reasonably to have known, of the alleged error on the part of the plaintiffs.
Correspondingly, they conceded that they could not expect to obtain summary
judgment on the basis of any such alleged knowledge on the part of the
defendants since the disputed issue as to the defendants’ state of knowledge is
one that can only be appropriately resolved at the trial.
1
This concession having been made, in our opinion correctly, the plaintiffs were
confronted with at least formidable difficulties on their application for summary
judgment. On the face of it, the letter of the 22nd June 1982 constituted a formal,
unequivocal and unambiguous offer made to the defendants on behalf of the
plaintiffs, with an intent to create legal relations, to agree that the ‘current market
rental value’ of the demised premises, for the purpose of sub-paragraph A of the
rent review provision, was £65,000 per annum. On the face of it, the letter of the
23rd June 1982 constituted a formal, unequivocal and unambiguous acceptance of
that offer by the defendants. The plaintiffs’ solicitors indeed assert that they
erroneously inserted the figure of £65,000 in the letter of the 22nd June 1982 in
substitution for the figure of £126,000, which they had intended to insert; and like
the learned Judge we are prepared to accept the truth of this assertion for the
purpose of dealing with the present application. But in the absence of any proof, as
yet, that the defendants either knew or ought reasonably to have known of the
plaintiffs’ error at the time when they purported to accept the plaintiffs’ offer, why
should the plaintiffs now be allowed to resile from that offer? It is a well-established
principle of the English law of contract that an offer falls to be interpreted not
subjectively by reference to what has actually passed through the mind of the
offeror, but objectively, by reference to the interpretation which a reasonable man
in the shoes of the offeree would place on the offer. It is an equally well-established
principle that ordinarily an offer, when unequivocally accepted according to its
precise terms, will give rise to a legally binding agreement as soon as acceptance
is communicated to the offeror in the manner contemplated by the offer, and
cannot thereafter be revoked without the consent of the other party. Accepting, as
they do, that they have not yet proved that the defendants knew, or ought
reasonably to have known, of their error at the relevant time, how can the plaintiffs
assert that the defendants have no realistic hope of establishing an agreement of
the relevant nature by virtue of the two letters of the 22nd and 23rd June 1982?
Mr Richard Scott [counsel for the plaintiffs] in answer has submitted an
argument to the following effect. The ‘agreement’ envisaged by sub-paragraphs A
and B of the rent review provision is a genuine agreement, a real meeting of the
minds. In the present case there was no real meeting of the parties’ minds
because of the plaintiffs’ error. True it is that their intentions would have fallen to be
judged objectively, according to their external manifestation, if the defendants had
not only purported to accept the offer but had further altered their position as a
(a)
(b)
result. However, so the argument runs, the general rule that the intentions of an
offeror must be judged objectively is based on estoppel. Accordingly, if the person
who has accepted 
the offer has not altered his position in reliance on the offer, no
such estoppel arises. In the present case, it is submitted, the critical fact is that the
figure of £65,000 was lower than the rent currently payable under the Lease
immediately before the 25th December 1982. In these circumstances, it is said, the
defendants in agreeing that figure, did not alter their position in any way. Because
of sub-paragraph E of the rent review provision, the current rent of £68,320 would
have continued to be payable after the 25th December 1982, notwithstanding the
agreement. In all the circumstances, it is submitted, the plaintiffs, having proved
their error at the relevant time, were at liberty to withdraw the offer contained in the
letter of the 22nd June 1982, even after it had been accepted, and they duly did so
at the end of June 1982. …
The nature of the apparent contract concluded by the two letters of the 22nd
and 23rd June 1982 is what is sometimes called a ‘bilateral contract’. It was
concluded by
an offer by the plaintiffs to treat £65,000 as the ‘current market rental value’
of the premises for the purpose of the Lease if the defendants would
promise to accept that figure as that value, followed by
the giving of a promise by the defendants in those terms.
Where the nature of an offer is to enter into a bilateral contract, the contract
becomes binding when the offeree gives the requested promise to the promisor in
the manner contemplated by the offer; the mutual promises alone will suffice to
conclude the contract. In our opinion, subject to what is said below relating to
consideration, it is contrary to the well established principles of contract law to
suggest that the offeror under a bilateral contract can withdraw an unambiguous
offer, after it has been accepted in the manner contemplated by the offer, merely
because he has made a mistake which the offeree neither knew nor could
reasonably have known at the time when he accepted it. And in this context,
provided only that the offeree has given sufficient consideration for the offeror’s
promise, it is nothing to the point that the offeree may not have changed his
position beyond giving the promise requested of him.
For these reasons we think that the plaintiffs’ submissions based on mistake
cannot, as matters stand, suffice to negative the existence of the apparent
agreement of the parties to treat £65,000 as the current market rental value for the
purpose of the Lease and to deprive the defendants of the right to defend this
action on the basis of such agreement, though we are not, of course, saying that
the plea of mistake as formulated in the statement of claim will not succeed at the
trial…
This is a case where the defendants clearly ought to be given leave to defend
this action, unless the plaintiffs can satisfy the Court that the defendants have no
realistic prospect of establishing an agreement of the relevant nature at the trial.
The plaintiffs have not so satisfied us on the evidence now before the Court.
Commentary
It is important to note that the plaintiffs in this case were seeking summary judgment
against the defendants under what was Order 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (see
now Part 24 of the Civil Procedure Rules). Order 14 rule 1 provided:
Where in an action to which this rule applies a statement of claim has been served on a defendant and that
defendant has given notice of intention to defend the action, the plaintiff may, on the ground that the defendant
has no defence to a claim included in the writ, or to a particular part of such a claim, or has no defence to such a
claim or part except as to the amount of any damages claimed, apply to the Court for judgment against that
defendant.
The court in an Order 14 case could either give judgment for the plaintiff or give the
defendant leave to defend. The Court of Appeal in the present case gave the defendants
unconditional leave to defend the action. All this means is that the defendant is entitled
to defend the claim so that the plaintiff must proceed to trial if he is to succeed in his
claim. This being the case, the plaintiffs’ claim in 
Centrovincial
 
would proceed to trial
unless the parties were able to settle it before trial.
What would the plaintiffs have to prove in order to win their claim at trial? According to
Slade LJ they would have to prove that the ‘defendants either knew or ought to have
known of the plaintiffs’ error at the time when they purported to accept the plaintiffs’
offer’. One might think that the fact that the proposed rental was lower than the existing
rental (and that sub-clause E stated that effect could not be given to a proposal to lower
the rent) would have alerted the defendants to the fact that the proposed reduction in
the rental value was a mistake. But Mr Evans, a chartered surveyor who acted for the
defendants and who drafted the defendants’ letter of 23 June, swore an affidavit in
which he ‘strongly denied that he either knew or ought reasonably to have known of any
such error and supported this denial by a number of reasons’. The state of the
defendants’ knowledge was therefore a matter of dispute and, as Slade LJ stated, that
dispute could ‘only be appropriately resolved at the trial’.
The decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Centrovincial
 
establishes a number of points of
importance. First, it affirms the general rule that the intentions of the parties are to be
ascertained objectively and not subjectively. Secondly, it rejects the proposition that this
general rule is based on estoppel.
 
It is a rule of contract law and is not confined to
estoppel. Thus it was not necessary for the defendants to establish that they had acted to
their detriment in reliance upon the plaintiffs’ offer in order to hold the plaintiffs to the
terms of their offer. The fact that they had accepted the offer was sufficient to give rise to
a binding contract, notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiffs were mistaken and that
they pointed out their mistake to the defendants immediately and before the defendants
had acted on it in any way. This aspect of the decision has aroused some controversy.
Thus Professor Atiyah has asked (‘The Hannah Blumenthal and Classical Contract Law’
(1986) 102 
LQR
 
363, 368–369):
Why should an offeree be entitled to create legal rights for himself by the bare act of acceptance when he has in
no way relied upon the offer before being informed that it was made as a result of a mistake and did not in
reality reflect the intention of the offeror? Now that liability for misleading statements is an accepted part of tort
law, it becomes increasingly anomalous if in a contractual context a party is able to sue upon an unrelied-upon
statement, whereas in any other context he is not. A misleading offer is a commercial or perhaps a social
nuisance which should be discouraged, and for which compensation may be due, if loss is thereby caused, but
surely the principles governing such misleading communications ought not to depend upon whether the
communication can be classified as an offer or not?
The answer given by the Court of Appeal to Professor Atiyah’s questions is that, while a
binding promise may render reliance possible, it is not the case that it is the reliance
that renders the promise binding. The parties were bound to one another the moment
that the defendants accepted the plaintiffs’ offer and there was nothing further that the
defendants needed to do in order to render the contract binding. Were the law otherwise
parties would not be able to have confidence in the security of their transactions unless
and until they had acted to their detriment upon the promise made by the other party.
The plaintiffs’ offer was therefore 
binding upon them from the moment of acceptance,
2
and they could not unilaterally bring that agreement to an end by the assertion that their
offer contained within it a mistake. On its facts the decision in 
Centrovincial
 
may seem
harsh on the plaintiffs. But any appearance of hardship is mitigated by two factors. The
first is that the plaintiffs may well have had an action in negligence against their
solicitors who mistakenly inserted the figure of £65,000 in the offer. The second is the
need to consider the position of the defendants and, more generally, the need for a
measure of security in commercial transactions. Assuming that the defendants neither
knew nor ought reasonably to have known of the plaintiffs’ mistake, why should they not
be entitled to the benefit of their bargain? Parties need to know where they stand in
relation to transactions that have been concluded and, were the law to allow a party to
escape from an agreement by the mere assertion that he entered into it under a mistake,
such security would be significantly undermined (see further D Friedmann, ‘The
Objective Principle and Mistake and Involuntariness in Contract and Restitution’ (2003)
119 
LQR
 
68).
Finally, the Court of Appeal noted that it was open to the plaintiffs to prove at trial that
the defendants either knew or ought reasonably to have known of the plaintiffs’ mistake
at the time they purported to accept the plaintiffs’ offer. Cases in which the defendant
knew of the plaintiffs’ mistake at the time at which he purported to accept the plaintiffs’
offer are commonly referred to as examples of ‘snapping up’. These cases are discussed
in the next section. Cases in which the defendants ought reasonably to have known of
the plaintiffs’ mistake are slightly more difficult to classify. They could be examples of
‘snapping up’. But there is a wider category of case in which one party was at fault in
failing to notice that the other party’s offer contained a mistake, or he was himself
responsible for inducing that mistake in the other party. In such a case the party at fault
may not be entitled to hold the other party to the terms of his offer. These cases are
discussed in the final section of this chapter.
 
The terms of Order 14 are set out in the Commentary following the extract from the judgment of Slade LJ.

The ‘Snapping Up’ Cases
HARTOG V. COLIN & SHIELDS
[1939] 3 All ER 566, King’s Bench Division
The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had agreed to sell him 30,000 Argentine
hare skins and that, in breach of contract, the defendants had failed to deliver
them. He accordingly brought an action for damages against the defendants. The
defendants denied that any binding contract had been entered into. They
maintained that they had made a mistake in offering to sell the hare skins at a price
per pound when they had intended to sell the skins at a price per piece (the value
of a piece being approximately one third of the value of a pound). Further, the
defendants alleged that the plaintiff was well aware of the mistake and had
‘fraudulently’ accepted an offer which ‘he well knew that the defendants had never
intended to make’. It was held that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages
from the defendants on the ground that he must have known that the defendants’
offer contained a material mistake.
Singleton J
In this case, the plaintiff, a Belgian subject, claims damages against the
defendants because he says they broke a contract into which they entered with
him for the sale of Argentine 
hare skins. The defendants’ answer to that claim is:
‘There really was no contract, because you knew that the document which went
forward to you, in the form of an offer, contained a material mistake. You realised
that, and you sought to take advantage of it.’
Counsel for the defendants took upon himself the onus of satisfying me that the
plaintiff knew that there was a mistake and sought to take advantage of that
mistake. In other words, realising that there was a mistake, the plaintiff did that
which James LJ, in 
Tamplin
 
v. 
James
 
(1880) 15 Ch D 215, 211, described as
‘snapping up the offer’. It is important, I think, to realise that in the verbal
negotiations which took place in this country, and in all the discussions there had
ever been, the prices of Argentine hare skins had been discussed per piece, and
later, when correspondence took place, the matter was always discussed at the
price per piece, and never at a price per pound. Those witnesses who were called
on behalf of the plaintiff have had comparatively little experience of dealing in
Argentine hare skins. Even the expert witness who was called had had very little.
One witness, Mr Caytan, I think, had had no dealings in them for some years,
though before that he had had some, no doubt. On the whole, I think that the
evidence of Mr Wilcox, on behalf of the defendants, is the more likely to be right—
namely, that the way in which Argentine hare skins are bought and sold is
generally per piece. That is shown by the discussions which took place between
the parties in this country, and by the correspondence. Then on 23 November
came the offer upon which the plaintiff relies. It was an offer of 10,000 Argentine
hares, winters (100 skins equalling 16 kilos), at 10d per lb; 10,000 half hares at 6d
per lb; 10,000 summer hares at 5d per lb. Those prices correspond, roughly, in the
case of the winter hares, to 3d per piece, half hares 2d per piece, and summer
hares 1d per piece. The last offer prior to this, in which prices were mentioned, was
on 3 November from the defendants, and the price then quoted for winter hares
was 10d per piece. Even allowing that the market was bound to fall a little, I find it
difficult to believe that anyone could receive an offer for a large quantity of
Argentine hares at a price so low as 3d per piece without having the gravest
doubts of it. …
I cannot help thinking that, when this quotation in pence per pound reached Mr
Hartog, the plaintiff, he must have realised, and that Mr Caytan, too, must have
realised, that there was a mistake. Otherwise I cannot understand the quotation.
There was an absolute difference from anything which had gone before—a
difference in the manner of quotation, in that the skins are offered per pound
instead of per piece.
I am satisfied that it was a mistake on the part of the defendants or their
servants which caused the offer to go forward in that way, and I am satisfied that
anyone with any knowledge of the trade must have realised that there was a
mistake. I find it difficult to understand why, when Mr Caytan bought in this way at
11d per lb, he could not tell me what the total purchase price was, and I cannot
help thinking that there was an arrangement of some sort, amounting rather to a
division of the spoil. That is the view I formed, having heard the witnesses. I do not
form it lightly. I have seen the witnesses and heard them, and in this case can form
no other view than that there was an accident. The offer was wrongly expressed,
and the defendants by their evidence, and by the correspondence, have satisfied
me that the plaintiff could not reasonably have supposed that that offer contained
the offerers’ real intention. Indeed, I am satisfied to the contrary. That means that
there must be judgment for the defendants.
Commentary
Singleton J attributes the phrase ‘snapping up’ to the judgment of James LJ in 
Tamplin
v. 
James
 
(a case which is discussed at 
2.4
).
Singleton J states that, on the evidence, the plaintiff ‘must have realised, and did in fact
know, that a mistake had occurred’. This suggests that he found that the plaintiff
actually 
knew that a mistake had been made. But this finding does not appear to have
been crucial to the outcome of the case because he also makes it clear in his judgment
that it sufficed for the defendants to demonstrate that the plaintiff could not reasonably
have supposed that the offer expressed the defendants’ real intention. The judgment
therefore combined subjective and objective elements. The plaintiff was not entitled to
enforce the contract either because he knew that the defendants had made a mistake or
on the ground that the reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position would have known
that the defendants had made a mistake.
What were the factors that led Singleton J to conclude that the plaintiff could not
reasonably have supposed that the offer expressed the defendants’ real intention? Two
factors appear to predominate. The first was that the prior negotiations were conducted
on the basis of a price per piece and the second was the extent of the disparity between
the price per piece and the price per pound.
A more modern illustration of the application of this rule is provided by the facts of
Chwee Kin Keong
 
v. 
Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd
 
[2004] 2 SLR(R) 594 (affirmed [2005]
SGCA 2, [2005] 1 SLR 502). The defendants mistakenly altered the price of commercial
laser printers on their website. The price was altered from 3,854 Singaporean dollars to
66 Singaporean dollars. Overnight some 4,000 printers were ordered before the
defendants were informed of their mistake. The defendants contacted all the purchasers
immediately they became aware of the mistake, informed them of the mistake, and
stated that they would not be supplying the printers at the price of S$66. The six
plaintiffs refused to accept this and claimed that they were entitled to the benefit of their
bargain. Between them the six plaintiffs had ordered 1,606 printers and they claimed
that they were entitled to the benefit of their good bargain (namely the acquisition of
printers with a market value of S$6,189,524 for S$105,996). Rajah JC held that the
plaintiffs were not entitled to succeed with their claim. He examined the evidence in
relation to all six plaintiffs (one of whom had placed orders for 1,090 printers) and
concluded that ‘they were fully conscious that an unfortunate and egregious mistake had
indeed been made by the defendant’. In reaching this conclusion he had regard to the
fact that there was a ‘stark gaping difference between the price posting and the market
price’ of the printers and the fact that the plaintiffs were ‘well-educated professionals—
articulate, entrepreneurial and, quite bluntly, streetwise and savvy individuals’. A
further factor relied upon by Rajah JC was the circumstances in which the printers were
purchased. The orders were placed in the ‘dead of night’ with ‘indecent haste’ and the
email exchanges between the plaintiffs demonstrated that they were ‘clearly anxious to
place their orders before the defendant took steps to correct the error’. In these
circumstances he held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to enforce ‘their purported
contractual rights’ and so he dismissed their claim.
Is 
Hartog
 
an example of an objective approach to agreement or a subjective approach?
It can be argued that it is an example of a subjective approach on the basis that,
objectively, the parties did reach agreement. The defendants offered to sell the hare
skins at a price per pound and the plaintiff accepted that offer. It was the fact that the
plaintiff knew that the defendants were mistaken that led Singleton J to conclude that
no contract had been concluded to sell the hare skins at a price per pound. This suggests
that the vital factor in persuading Singleton J to conclude that the plaintiff was not
entitled to recover damages was his finding that the parties were not subjectively agreed.
On the other hand, it is possible to get to the same conclusion via the application of an
objective test. Thus Professor Endicott has argued (‘Objectivity, Subjectivity and
Incomplete Agreements’ in J Horder (ed), 
Oxford Essays in Jurisprudence
, Fourth
Series (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 157) that ‘
Hartog
 
does not depart from the
objective approach, because a reasonable person who knew that A had made a blunder
in communicating a term would not treat A as having agreed to price hare skins per
pound’.
Howarth treats 
Hartog
 
as an example of ‘promisee objectivity’ ((1984) 100 
LQR
 
265,
272), while Vorster points out that the penultimate sentence in the judgment of
Singleton J adopts the standard of ‘promisor objectivity’ ((1987) 103 
LQR
 
274, 281
n.42). This further illustrates the terminological confusion which Howarth’s approach
can cause. The promise which was the subject matter of the dispute was the defendants’
offer to sell the hare skins and the court focused attention on the plaintiff’s
understanding of that offer. In relation to the promise to sell, the plaintiff was the
promisee. The reason for the focus on the position of the plaintiff was that he was
seeking to enforce his version of the contract and it was his understanding (or, more
accurately, the understanding of the reasonable person in his position) that was in issue.
But the position would have been otherwise had the defendants brought a claim against
the plaintiff on the basis that the parties had concluded a contract to sell the hare skins
at a price per piece. No such claim was brought on the facts. The defendants had not
delivered the hare skins to the plaintiff and were content simply to deny the existence of
a contract. But suppose that the defendants had attempted to deliver the hare skins and
the plaintiff had refused to pay at a price per piece. Would Singleton J have found the
existence of a contract to sell the hare skins at a price per piece? This is not an easy
question to answer. There seems little point in asking how a reasonable person in the
position of the defendants would have understood the plaintiff’s promise to pay given
that there was no dispute in relation to the promise to pay. It was the promise to sell
that was in dispute. Given that the plaintiff knew of the defendants’ mistake and must
have known that the defendants’ intention was to sell at a price per piece, should his
acceptance of their offer be regarded as an acceptance of an offer to sell at a price per
piece? It is suggested that it should not. Objectively the price agreed was a price per
pound, and the fact that the plaintiff snapped at a bargain he knew was not intended
should not result in him being bound by an offer that was never in fact made. A
reasonable person in the position of the defendants, who was aware of the fact that the
plaintiff had purported to snap at an offer which he knew was not intended, would be
more likely to conclude that no contract had been formed because the parties were at
cross-purposes and not that a contract had been concluded on his terms. This appears to
have been the view of the defendants in 
Hartog
. Their defence was that no contract had
been concluded; it was not to assert the existence of a contract on their own terms.
2.4
 
The Role of Fault
More difficult are the cases in which the mistake in relation to the terms of the contract
has been induced or caused by one of the parties to the contract. Three cases will be
discussed in this context. In all three the claim was brought by a seller. In the first and
third cases it was held that the seller was not entitled to the remedy which he sought on
the ground that he was responsible for creating in the mind of the buyer a mistake in
relation to the terms of the seller’s offer. In the second case it was held that the buyer
was responsible for his own misapprehension, and so the seller was held to be entitled to
the remedy that it sought.
DENNY V. HANCOCK
(1870) LR 6 Ch App 1, Court of Appeal
The plaintiffs put up property for sale by auction. Prior to bidding for the land, the
defendant inspected the property. He took with him a plan that had been annexed
to the particulars of sale. The plan showed that the western side of the property
was bounded by a strip of ground that was covered with a mass of shrubs or trees.
The defendant discovered an iron fence and three magnificent trees to the west of
the property and, in the belief that they represented the western edge of the
property, he bid for it. In fact the fence and the three trees belonged to an adjoining
property. The actual boundary of the property was in fact concealed by shrubs.
Further, the plan represented all the trees on the property in a conspicuous
manner but did not show the three trees seen by the defendant. The three trees
were found to be a material element in the value of the property. When he
discovered the mistake the defendant refused to complete the purchase. The
plaintiffs sought a decree of specific performance and they succeeded before
Malins VC. The defendant appealed successfully to the Court of Appeal where it
was held that the defendant had been misled by the fault of the plaintiffs and that
the plaintiffs were not entitled to a specific performance order.
Sir W.M. James LJ
I have no doubt whatever that if I had done exactly what this gentleman did, and
taken that plan in my hand, and gone through the property, and found a shrubbery,
or ground covered partly with shrubs and partly with thorns, with an iron fence
outside, I should have arrived at exactly the same conclusion as this gentleman
did, and I should have gone to the sale and bid in the belief that I was buying the
belt up to the iron fence with those trees upon it …
There is no denial in evidence of this fact, that the plan produced was
calculated to induce anybody to believe that the whole of the belt, or shrubbery, or
whatever you may call it, was included in the property sold. It is urged, however,
that the Defendant was negligent. The substance of the argument seems to be
this: that if he had looked at the plan very minutely he would have seen that the
trees in the meadows and in the garden were marked, but these three fine trees,
which added so much to the value of the property, were not marked; and it is urged
that the absence of these remarkable trees from the plan is a thing calculated to
put a man so completely on his guard that he ought not to have been misled, and
is not to be believed when he says he was misled. But it seems to me that it never
would occur to a person who entertained no doubt whatever about what the thing
was that had been sold to him, to make any inquiry about the omission of two or
three trees in that which appeared on the plan to be a mass of wood. If this
gentleman did as he says, buy it under a mistake as to the property, such mistake
was caused by the plan which was presented to him, drawn by the vendors’ agent,
and also caused by this fact, which alone might have been enough to mislead him,
that there was on the ground an apparent visible boundary, quite distinct from the
almost invisible real boundary. I think that, independently of the plan, and on this
latter ground alone, it would have required great consideration before a Court of
Equity would have fixed the purchaser with this contract, which he swears he
entered into in the belief that the property extended to its apparent boundary; but
coupling the state of the property with the representation made by the plan, I am of
opinion that it would not be according to the established principles of this Court to
compel the purchaser to complete his contract. I am also of opinion that the
mistake was occasioned by at least 
crassa negligentia
 
on the part of the vendors
in respect to what they sent out to the public. I am, therefore, unable to agree with
the Vice-Chancellor, and am of opinion that he ought to have dismissed this bill
with costs.
Sir G. Mellish LJ
 
[delivered a concurring judgment].
TAMPLIN V. JAMES
(1880) 15 Ch D 215, Court of Appeal
The plaintiffs put property up for sale under the following description:
‘All that well-accustomed inn, with the brewhouse, outbuildings, and premises known as 
The Ship
,
together with the messuage, saddler’s shop, and premises adjoining thereto, situate at 
Newerne
, in the
same parish, No 454 and 455 on the said tithe map, and containing by admeasurement twenty perches,
more or less, now in the occupation of Mrs 
Knowles
 
and Mr 
S. Merrick
.’
‘This lot is situate close to the 
Lydney Town
 
station, on the 
Severn and Wye Railway
, and abuts on
other premises of the vendors, on the canal, and on lands now or late of the Rev. W. H. Bathurst.’
The lot was not sold at the auction but the defendant, who was present at the
auction, made an offer to buy the property immediately afterwards. His offer was
accepted, and he signed a contract to purchase the property according to the
conditions of sale for £750. The defendant made his offer in the belief that two
pieces of garden were included in the sale. The reason for his belief was that he
had known the property from the time that he was a boy and he knew that the
gardens had always been occupied with the Ship Inn and the saddler’s shop. Had
he looked at the plans for the sale he would have seen that the gardens were not
included in the sale and, further, that they were not included in the description of
the sale. When he discovered his mistake the defendant refused to complete the
sale unless the gardens were conveyed to him. The plaintiffs brought an action for
specific performance. Both at first instance (before Baggallay LJ) and in the Court
of Appeal it was held that the plaintiffs were entitled to a specific performance
order.
Baggallay LJ
The Defendant insists in his statement of defence that he signed the memorandum
in the reasonable belief that the property comprised therein included the whole of
the premises in the occupation of Mrs 
Knowles
 
and of Mr 
Samuel Merrick
, and not
merely the messuages and hereditaments which the Plaintiffs allege to be the only
property comprised therein, and that such his belief was induced and confirmed by
the acts and words of the auctioneer at the sale. The Defendant has sworn
positively that he had such a belief at the time he signed the memorandum, and I
see no reason to doubt the statement so made by him; but was such a belief a
reasonable belief?
It is doubtless well established that a Court of Equity will refuse specific
performance of an agreement when the Defendant has entered into it under a
mistake, and where injustice would be done to him were performance to be
enforced. The most common instances of such refusal on the ground of mistake
are cases in which there has been some unintentional misrepresentation on the
part of the Plaintiff (I am not now referring to cases of intentional misrepresentation
which would fall rather under the category of fraud), or where from the ambiguity of
the agreement different meanings have been given to it by the different parties. …
But where there has been no misrepresentation, and where there is no ambiguity
in the terms of the contract, the Defendant cannot be allowed to evade the
performance of it by the simple statement that he has made a mistake. Were such
to be the law the performance of a contract could rarely be enforced upon an
unwilling party who was also unscrupulous. I think that the law is correctly stated
by Lord Romilly in 
Swaisland
 
v. 
Dearsley
 
29 Beav 430, 433: ‘The principle on
which the Court proceeds in cases of mistake is this—if it appears upon the
evidence that there was in the description of the property a matter on which a
person 
might 
bonâ fide
 
make a mistake, and he swears positively that he did make
such mistake, and his evidence is not disproved, this Court cannot enforce the
specific performance against him. If there appears on the particulars no ground for
the mistake, if no man with his senses about him could have misapprehended the
character of the parcels, then I do not think it is sufficient for the purchaser to
swear that he made a mistake, or that he did not understand what he was about.’
Now does it appear, or can it safely be held in this case that the Defendant
reasonably entertained a belief that the gardens were included in the property
purchased by him? I will consider first the terms of the contract itself, and then the
allegations as to the acts and words of the auctioneer and other agents of the
Plaintiffs, for it is possible that although the terms of the agreement taken per se
may have been free from doubt, enough may have been said or done by the
Plaintiffs’ agents to lead the Defendant to attribute a different meaning to its terms.
Mr 
Pearson
 
[counsel for the plaintiffs] admitted, and I think he could not well
have avoided admitting, that if the vendors had merely referred to the property as
being in the occupation of Mrs 
Knowles
 
and Mr 
Merrick
 
without more, there would
have been at any rate such an amount of ambiguity that the Defendant might
reasonably have understood that he was purchasing the whole of the property in
their occupation. But the particulars go on to state that the property sold is Nos.
454 and 455 on the tithe map and contains twenty perches. The additional land
which the Defendant claims to have included is about twenty perches more.
Therefore, if he is right in his contention, he would be entitled to double the amount
which the printed particulars state the lot to contain. There, no doubt, is force in the
argument that a person unaccustomed to measuring would not know whether a
property contained twenty perches or forty perches, but that does not get rid of the
effect of the reference to the tithe map. The Defendant appears to have purchased
in reliance upon his knowledge of the occupation of the premises without looking at
the plans, and probably without paying any attention to the details of the particulars
of Lot 1, but is a person justified in relying upon knowledge of that kind when he
has the means of ascertaining what he buys? I think not. I think that he is not
entitled to say to any effectual purpose that he was under a mistake, when he did
not think it worth while to read the particulars and look at the plans. If that were to
be allowed, a person might always escape from completing a contract by swearing
that he was mistaken as to what he bought, and great temptation to perjury would
be offered. Here the description of the property is accurate and free from
ambiguity, and the case is wholly unaffected by 
Manser
 
v. 
Back
 
6 Hare 443 and
the other cases in which the Defendant has escaped from performance of a
contract on the ground of its ambiguity.
Baggallay LJ
 
therefore made a decree for specific performance. The defendant
appealed to the Court of Appeal.
James LJ
In my opinion, the order under appeal is right. The vendors did nothing tending to
mislead. In the particulars of sale they described the property as consisting of Nos.
454 and 455 on the tithe map, and this was quite correct. The purchaser says that
the tithe map is on so small a scale as not to give sufficient information, but he
never looked at it. He must be presumed to have looked at it, and at the particulars
of sale. He says he knew the property, and was aware that the gardens were held
with the other property in the occupation of the tenants, and he came to the
conclusion that what was offered for sale was the whole of what was in the
occupation of the tenants, but he asked no question about it. If a man will 
not take
reasonable care to ascertain what he is buying, he must take the consequences.
The defence on the ground of mistake cannot be sustained. It is not enough for a
purchaser to swear, ‘I thought the farm sold contained twelve fields which I knew,
and I find it does not include them all’, or, ‘I thought it contained 100 acres and it
only contains eighty’. It would open the door to fraud if such a defence was to be
allowed. Perhaps some of the cases on this subject go too far, but for the most part
the cases where a Defendant has escaped on the ground of a mistake not
contributed to by the Plaintiff, have been cases where a hardship amounting to
injustice would have been inflicted upon him by holding him to his bargain, and it
was unreasonable to hold him to it. 
Webster
 
v. 
Cecil
 
30 Beav 62 is a good instance
of that, being a case where a person snapped at an offer which he must have
perfectly well-known to be made by mistake, and the only fault I find with the case
is that, in my opinion, the bill ought to have been dismissed with costs. It is said
that it is hard to hold a man to a bargain entered into under a mistake, but we must
consider the hardship on the other side. Here are trustees realizing their testator’s
estate, and the reckless conduct of the Defendant may have prevented their selling
to somebody else. If a man makes a mistake of this kind without any reasonable
excuse he ought to be held to his bargain.

SCRIVEN BROTHERS & CO V. HINDLEY & CO
[1913] 3 KB 564, King’s Bench Division
The plaintiffs instructed an auctioneer to sell by auction a large quantity of Russian
hemp and tow. The auctioneer prepared a catalogue which did not distinguish
between the hemp and the tow. Further, both lots were given the same shipping
mark, ‘S.L.’. Lots 63–67 were the hemp and consisted of 47 bales and lots 68–79
were the tow and consisted of 176 bales. Prior to the sale, samples of hemp and
tow were displayed in the show-rooms in Cutler Street. Opposite the samples of
hemp was written in chalk ‘S.L. 63 to 67’ and opposite the samples of tow was
written ‘S.L. 68 to 79’. The defendants’ manager, Mr Gill, inspected the hemp but
not the tow (he was not interested in bidding for the tow). At the auction the
defendants’ buyer, Mr Macgregor, bid for the 47 bales of hemp and these were
knocked down to him. Lots 68–79 were then put up for sale and the defendants’
buyer bid £17 per ton for it (an extravagant price for tow). When the defendants
discovered their mistake they refused to pay for the tow. The plaintiffs brought an
action to recover the price of the tow. The defendants denied that they had agreed
to buy the tow and claimed that the tow had been knocked down to them under a
mistake of fact.
The jury made the following findings: ‘(1) That hemp and tow are different
commodities in commerce. (2) That the auctioneer intended to sell 176 bales of
tow. (3) That Macgregor intended to bid for 176 bales of hemp. (4) That the
auctioneer believed that the bid was made under a mistake when he knocked
down the lot. (5) That the auctioneer had reasonable ground for believing that the
mistake was merely one as to value. (6) That the form of the catalogue and the
conduct of Calman [the foreman in charge of the show], or one of them,
contributed to cause the mistake that occurred. (7) That Mr Gill’s “negligence” in
not taking his catalogue to Cutler Street and more closely examining and
identifying the bales with lots contributed to cause Macgregor’s mistake.’
On the basis of these findings it was held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to
recover the price of the tow from the defendants.
A.T. Lawrence J
In this case the plaintiffs brought an action for 476l. 12s. 7d., the price of 560 cwt. 2
qrs. 27 lbs. of Russian tow, as being due for goods bargained and sold. The
defendants by their defence denied that they agreed to buy this Russian tow, and
alleged that they bid for Russian hemp and that the tow was knocked down to
them under a mistake of fact as to the subject matter of the supposed contract.
The circumstances were these.
[He stated the facts and the findings of the jury as set out earlier, and
continued]
Upon these findings both plaintiffs and defendants claimed to be entitled to
judgment. A number of cases were cited upon either side. I do not propose to
examine them in detail because I think that the findings of the jury determine what
my judgment should be in this case.
The jury have found that hemp and tow are different commodities in commerce.
I should suppose that no one can doubt the correctness of this finding. The second
and third findings of the jury shew that the parties were never ad idem as to the
subject matter of the proposed sale; there was therefore in fact no contract of
bargain and sale. The plaintiffs can recover from the defendants only if they can
shew that the defendants are estopped from relying upon what is now admittedly
the truth. Mr Hume Williams for the plaintiffs argued very ingeniously that the
defendants were estopped; for this he relied upon findings 5 and 7, and upon the
fact that the defendants had failed to prove the allegation in paragraph 4 of the
defence to the effect that Northcott knew at the time he knocked down the lot that
Macgregor was bidding for hemp and not for tow.
I must, of course accept for the purposes of this judgment the findings of the
jury, but I do not think they create any estoppel. Question No 7 was put to the jury
as a supplementary question, after they had returned into Court with their answers
to the other questions, upon the urgent insistence of the learned junior counsel for
the plaintiffs. It begs an essential question by using the word ‘negligence’ and
assuming that the purchaser has a duty towards the seller to examine goods that
he does not wish to buy, and to correct any latent defect there may be in the
sellers’ catalogue. Once it was admitted that Russian hemp was never before
known to be consigned or sold with the same shipping marks as Russian tow from
the same cargo, it was natural for the person inspecting the ‘S.L.’ goods and being
shewn hemp to suppose that the ‘S. L.’ bales represented the commodity hemp.
Inasmuch as it is admitted that someone had perpetrated a swindle upon the bank
which made advances in respect of this shipment of goods it was peculiarly the
duty of the auctioneer to make it clear to the bidder either upon the face of his
catalogue or in some other way which lots were hemp and which lots were tow.
To rely upon a purchaser’s discovering chalk marks upon the floor of the show-
room seems to me unreasonable as demanding an amount of care upon the part
of the buyer which the vendor had no right to exact. A buyer when he examines a
sample does so for his own benefit and not in the discharge of any duty to the
seller; the use of the word ‘negligence’ in such a connection is entirely misplaced, it
should be reserved for cases of want of due care where some duty is owed by one
person to another. No evidence was tendered of the existence of any such duty
upon the part of buyers of hemp. In so far as there was any evidence upon the
point it was given by a buyer called as a witness for the plaintiffs who said he had
marked the word ‘tow’ on his catalogue when at the show-rooms ‘for his own
protection.’ I ought probably to have refused to leave the seventh question to the
jury; but neither my complaisance nor their answer can create a duty. In my view it
is clear that the finding of the jury upon the sixth question prevents the plaintiffs
from being able to insist upon a contract by estoppel. Such a contract cannot arise
when the person seeking to enforce it has by his own negligence or by that of
those for whom he is responsible caused, or contributed to cause, the mistake.
I am therefore of the opinion that judgment should be entered for the
defendants.
Commentary
In 
Denny
 
and 
Scriven
 
the seller’s claim failed because the seller was at fault in creating
the mistake in the mind of the buyer, whereas in 
Tamplin
 
the fault was found to be that
of the buyer, not the seller. In this sense 
Denny
 
and 
Scriven
 
belong together. But there
is also a sense in which 
Denny
 
and 
Tamplin
 
belong together in that they both concern
the remedy of specific performance, whereas in 
Scriven
 
the seller’s action was one to
recover the price. Specific performance is a discretionary remedy (unlike a claim for
damages or the action for the price) and so a court may refuse to grant a specific
performance order notwithstanding the fact that a binding contract has been concluded
between the parties.
 
This being the case, it does not necessarily follow from the refusal
of the Court of Appeal in 
Denny
 
to make a specific performance order that no contract
had been concluded between the parties. Had the plaintiffs in 
Denny
 
brought an action
for damages then it would have been necessary for the court formally to decide whether
or not a contract had been concluded at least on the terms alleged by the seller. 
Scriven
takes matters a stage further in that there Lawrence J did decide that the plaintiffs were
not entitled to recover the price of the goods, so that it is clear that in that case there was
no contract between the parties, at least on the terms alleged by the seller.
Are these cases examples of an objective approach or a subjective approach? Take
Scriven
 
as an example. Lawrence J uses language that is consistent with a subjective test
and it could be argued that, objectively, the parties were in agreement because in the
normal case an auctioneer is entitled to assume that a bidder knows what he is bidding
for. It was the fact that the parties were not subjectively in agreement and that the
3
plaintiffs were responsible for inducing a mistake in the mind of the defendants that led
Lawrence J to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim. On the other hand, it is possible to reach the
same conclusion by virtue of the application of an objective test. Thus Professor
Endicott has argued (‘Objectivity, Subjectivity and Incomplete Agreements’ in J Horder
(ed), 
Oxford Essays in Jurisprudence
, Fourth Series (Oxford University Press, 2000), p.
159) that:
to hold that the parties had not reached agreement for the sale of tow, the court did not need to ask what the
buyer intended; a reasonable auctioneer who had induced the customer to believe that the lot was hemp would
not take the customer to be bidding for tow. The duty that the court identified gave the auctioneer reason not to
take the buyer to be bidding for tow, and bidding for a lot of tow in that context does not count as agreeing to
buy tow. So on an objective test, there was no agreement for the sale of tow.
Howarth considers 
Denny, Tamplin
, and 
Scriven
 
and states ((1984) 100 
LQR
 
265, 270–
271):
[T]he conclusion to be abstracted from these three decisions must be that there is a body of judicial support for
the principle that contract formation is to be viewed from the perspective of the promisor rather than any other
viewpoint. If contract formation is to be objectively ascertained, the stance must be that of a reasonable man in
the promisor’s position rather than that of the actual promisor.
Vorster disagrees. He states ((1987) 103 
LQR
 
274, 277) that Howarth’s conclusion is
‘misleading’ on the basis that:
these three cases are not authority for ‘promisor’ objectivity in the conventional sense of that term. In all three
cases there was disagreement about what exactly, if anything, had been bought and sold. There was, in other
words, a dispute about the content of the seller’s promise. As it was the seller’s promise which had to be
interpreted, the seller was the promisor for purposes of the dispute as to whether a binding contract had been
concluded. In all three cases it was the seller who was attempting to enforce the buyer’s obligation to pay the
agreed price. In the terminology of Howarth this made the seller the 
promisee
, whereas, according to
conventional usage, the seller would be the 
promisor
 
for purposes of the dispute.
In all three cases the court tried to determine what a reasonable man in the position of the buyer (i.e. the
promisee) would have thought he was buying. These decisions are, therefore, quite unremarkable. They are
wholly in accord with the main stream of authority in their period, as they are examples of ‘promisee’ objectivity
in the conventional meaning of that term.
Once again, we encounter our terminological problem. Vorster’s view seems the
preferable one in that all three cases are concerned to examine the buyer’s
understanding of the offer that was made and the role of the seller in producing that
understanding. But what would have been the position in 
Denny
 
or 
Scriven
 
if the buyer
had brought an action for breach of his own version of the contract? For example, in
Scriven
 
how would the reasonable person in the position of the seller have understood
the buyer’s offer to buy the lot? It is suggested that the reasonable person would have
understood it as an offer to purchase the lot that was being advertised for sale. This
being the case, there was no contract between the parties as they were at cross-purposes
as to the terms of the contract and so neither would be liable to the other in damages.
In conclusion, it is suggested that Vorster accurately captures the approach of the courts
when he states ((1987) 103 
LQR
 
274, 283):
The only practicable method of dealing with the formation of contracts, is to view the matter from the
perspectives of each of the parties concerned. … The fact that the courts do not expressly adopt this method in
cases dealing with mistake, is not necessarily due to judicial aversion to it. The majority of mistake cases have
been pleaded in such a way as to make it unnecessary for the courts to expressly formulate a comprehensive
approach to contract formation. In most cases the defendant who is sued for specific performance or damages
for breach of an apparent contract, is content to deny liability; accordingly the question whether he is entitled to
specific performance or damages for breach of 
his version
 
of the contract does not arise. If the court finds that
the plaintiff’s understanding of the contract was unreasonable, the claim fails. The same is true if the court finds
that the defendant’s understanding of the contract was reasonable. These two findings make it unnecessary for
the court to enquire into the reasonableness or otherwise of the other party’s understanding. 
Where the court
allows the claim for specific performance or damages because it accepts that the plaintiff’s understanding of the
contract was reasonable, it is at least implicit in this finding that the defendant’s understanding was
unreasonable. This has to be so, because if the differing understandings of the parties are both reasonable, there
is no contract. Where the court allows the claim because it accepts that the defendant’s understanding was
unreasonable, it is also at least implicit in this finding that the plaintiff’s version was reasonable.
In cases where the defendant does not merely deny the plaintiff’s claim, but counterclaims for specific
performance of his version of the contract it will necessarily be more apparent that the court views the question
from the perspectives of both parties.
 
Specific performance is discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 24

Offer and Acceptance
Central Issues
When deciding whether or not a contract has been concluded the
courts generally look for an offer made by one party that has been
accepted by the other. Not every contract can be analysed in terms of
offer and acceptance and indeed the ‘offer and acceptance’ model has
been criticized on the ground that it is too rigid and out of step with
commercial practice. These criticisms will be considered in the course
of this chapter.
An offer is a statement by one party of a willingness to enter into a
contract on the terms that he has put forward. An offer is generally
contrasted with an invitation to negotiate (or an ‘invitation to treat’)
which is no more than an invitation to the other party to enter into
negotiations on the terms proposed. The distinction between an offer
and an invitation to negotiate has proved to be a difficult one to draw
in certain circumstances, such as advertisements, the display of
goods for sale in shops, tenders, and auction sales. The problems
experienced by the courts in these contexts are explored in this
chapter.
An acceptance is a final and unqualified expression of assent to the
terms of an offer. The question whether an offer has been accepted
has generated a considerable amount of case-law, the outcome of
which can be expressed in the form of a number of different rules that
are set out in 
Section 3.4
. Some of these rules have given rise to
considerable difficulty in practice, particularly in connection with the
‘battle of the forms’.
An offer can be terminated by revocation, rejection by the person to
whom the offer has been made, lapse of time, the occurrence of a
stipulated event and, possibly, the death of one or other party to the
contract.
3.1
 
Introduction
It is not always an easy task to decide whether or not a contract has been concluded
between two (or more) parties. Uncertainty can exist at a number of different levels. In
the first place, it may not be clear whether the parties have entered into a contract at all.
For example, the 
parties may have been involved in protracted negotiations. These
negotiations may have produced agreement on many points but there may remain some
outstanding issues between the parties. Does the fact of these unresolved or disputed
issues preclude the existence of a binding contract? Secondly, there may be uncertainty
as to the precise point in time at which the contract was concluded between the parties.
At what point in the negotiation process did the parties cross the line from negotiating
parties to contracting parties? Or suppose that the parties have been corresponding
through the post. At what point in time do postal negotiations result in the conclusion of
a contract? Is it when the final letter, the letter of acceptance, is sent through the post or
is it when that letter is actually received (and read?) by its recipient? Finally, there may
be uncertainty as to the precise terms of the contract. The agreement between the
parties may be expressed in terms that are very vague. Does such vagueness prevent the
existence of a contract between the parties? Or what is to be done in the case where
there is agreement between the parties on the principal issues but there is disagreement
on some minor issues? Does such inconsistency mean that there cannot be a contract
between the parties? Or does the court have the power to ignore the inconsistency and
select the term that it believes is the most appropriate one to govern the relationship
between the parties?
This uncertainty should not be over-emphasized. The vast majority of contracts do not
give rise to such difficulties (or, if they do, they do not result in litigation). But when they
do arise the law must seek to resolve them. In order to do so, the courts have devised a
set of rules that they apply in order to determine whether or not the parties have, in fact,
concluded a contract. The principal rules applied by the courts can be stated relatively
shortly. A contract is created by an offer made by one party that has been accepted by
the party to whom the offer was made. There are two vital ingredients of this definition.
The first is the ‘offer’ and the second is the ‘acceptance’. Both of these words require
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
(vi)
further elaboration. An offer can be defined as a statement, whether written or oral, of a
willingness to be bound by the terms of the statement. Not every statement made in the
course of the negotiation process amounts to an offer. The statement may be no more
than a representation made by one party to the other that has induced that other to
enter into the contract but which has not been incorporated into the contract itself. This
issue will be discussed in more detail later (see 
Chapter 8
). The issue that falls to be
examined in this chapter is a different one, namely, whether or not the maker of the
statement intended to be bound by the terms put forward in his statement (in which
case it is an offer) or whether the statement simply reflects his current negotiating
position but is not a final commitment to that position (in which case it is an invitation
to negotiate or, as lawyers often call it, an ‘invitation to treat’). The distinction is easily
stated but can be difficult to apply in practice (see further 
3.2
).
The word ‘acceptance’ also requires further elaboration. Not everything that purports to
be an acceptance is, in fact, an acceptance in the eyes of the law. If the acceptance
contains terms which differ from those contained in the offer, it is not treated by the
courts as an acceptance but as a counter-offer. Thus, far from amounting to an
acceptance of the offer, a counter-offer operates as a rejection of the terms contained in
the original offer and is instead a fresh offer to be bound on the new terms put forward
(see further 
3.3.1
). These basic concepts of ‘offer’ and ‘acceptance’ have been refined by
case-law and the courts have, over time, developed a number of rules in response to the
facts of the cases that have come before them. Issues that have arisen before the courts
include the following:
when can an offer be revoked or withdrawn?
how do the rules of offer and acceptance apply to transactions concluded through
the post?
can the silence of an offeree amount to an acceptance?
must an acceptance be communicated to the offeror?
must the person to whom the offer is made comply precisely with the method of
acceptance which has been prescribed by the offeror? and
can a party accept an offer by performing an act which would otherwise amount
to an acceptance, when ignorant of the fact that an offer has been made?
These issues will be discussed in greater detail in the course of this chapter. Here it
suffices to draw attention to a number of features of the rules that have been laid down
by the courts over the years. The first is that the rules claim to be of general application.
The second is that the rules purport to give effect to the intention of the parties, albeit
their intention objectively ascertained. The third is that the rules in practice are often
inter-linked. For example, the question whether or not an offer has been accepted may
depend in a particular case on whether or not the offer was revoked before it was
accepted; a court deciding such a case must decide both when the acceptance and the
revocation took effect. Fourthly, the rules appear to attach considerable significance to
the precise moment in time at which the contract was concluded. Finally, the reception
of the offer and acceptance rules, as we know them today, is linked with the will theory
of contract, a theory that has been the subject of some criticism, particularly in its
application to unilateral contracts. Each of these features requires some further
elaboration.
3.1.1
 
General Application
The offer and acceptance rules purport to be of general application; that is to say they
are applicable to all contracts and not just to some. The supposed universality of these
rules is, in itself, a source of difficulty. Contracts are made in many different ways and it
is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to frame rules that can be applied across such a
broad spectrum. Contracts can be made in writing or orally; they can be made by letter,
email, or text message; they may be the outcome of a period of negotiation or they may
not; they may be made by an exchange of promises or they may be made by the conduct
of the parties, without any words passing between them. Further, the contract between
the parties may be bilateral or unilateral in nature. Most of the contracts discussed in
this book are bilateral in nature, that is to say, the two parties to the contract promise to
each other that they will carry out their respective obligations under the contract (in
other words, they exchange promises). In a unilateral contract, on the other hand, only
one party makes a promise to the other. The classic example of a unilateral contract is
an offer to pay a reward to someone who finds and returns a piece of lost property. In
this situation the promise is made by the party offering to pay the reward but there is no
counter-promise made in return. Members of the public do not promise that they will
look for and find the lost property. They accept the offer by doing the act stipulated in
the offer (in this instance, finding and returning the lost piece of property). As we shall
discover (in particular see 
3.2.1
 
and 
3.3.6
), the rules laid down by the courts require
some modification in their application to unilateral contracts.
The attempt by the courts to analyse all contracts in terms of offer and acceptance has
been the subject of some criticism. The leading judicial critic has been Lord Denning. In
Gibson
 
v. 
Manchester City Council
 
[1978] 1 WLR 520, 523 (the facts of which are set out
at 
3.2.1
) he stated:
To my mind it is a mistake to think that all contracts can be analysed into the form of offer and acceptance. I
know in some of the textbooks it has been the custom to do so; but, as I understand the law, there is no need to
look for a strict offer and acceptance. You should look at the correspondence as a whole and at the conduct of
the parties and see therefrom whether the parties have come to an agreement on everything that was material.
If by their correspondence and their conduct you can see an agreement on all material terms, which was
intended thenceforward to be binding, then there is a binding contract in law even though all the formalities
have not been gone through.
This statement elicited the following response from Lord Diplock when 
Gibson
 
was
subsequently appealed to the House of Lords. Lord Diplock stated ([1979] 1 WLR 294,
297):
My Lords, there may be certain types of contract, though I think they are exceptional, which do not fit easily
into the normal analysis of a contract as being constituted by offer and acceptance; but a contract alleged to
have been made by an exchange of correspondence between the parties in which the successive communications
other than the first are in reply to one another is not one of these. I can see no reason in the instant case for
departing from the conventional approach of looking at the handful of documents relied on as constituting the
contract sued on and seeing whether on their true construction there is to be found in them a contractual offer
by the council to sell the house to Mr Gibson and an acceptance of that offer by Mr Gibson. I venture to think
that it was by departing from this conventional approach that the majority of the Court of Appeal was led into
error.
Lord Diplock’s remark to the effect that cases can be found which cannot ‘easily’ be
accommodated within the offer and acceptance framework echoes a statement made by
Lord Wilberforce in 
New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
A M Satterthwaite & Co Ltd (The
Eurymedon)
 
[1975] AC 154. After noting that the relationship between the parties to the
case was of a commercial character and that the description of one set of promises as
gratuitous seemed ‘paradoxical and … prima facie implausible’, Lord Wilberforce
concluded (at p. 167):
It is only the precise analysis of this complex of relations into the classical offer and acceptance, with
identifiable consideration, that seems to present difficulty, but this same difficulty exists in many situations of
daily life, e.g. sales at auction; supermarket purchases; boarding an omnibus; purchasing a train ticket; tenders
for the supply of goods; offers of reward; acceptance by post; warranties of authority by agents; manufacturers’
guarantees; gratuitous bailments; bankers’ commercial credits. These are all examples which show that English
1
law, having committed itself to a rather technical and schematic doctrine of contract, in application takes a
practical approach, often at the cost of forcing the facts to fit uneasily into the marked slots of offer, acceptance
and consideration.
The classic example of a case that cannot be analysed in terms of offer and acceptance is
The Satanita
 
[1895] P 248 (CA), affirmed 
sub nom Clarke
 
v. 
Dunraven
 
[1897] AC 59
(HL). Both the plaintiff and the defendant entered their yachts in a regatta. In doing so
they agreed to be bound by the sailing rules of the Yacht Racing Association. One of
these rules provided that the owner of any ‘yacht disobeying or infringing any of these
rules … shall be liable for all damages arising therefrom’. In breach of one of the rules of
the Yacht Racing Association the defendant’s yacht ran into and sank the plaintiff’s
yacht. The collision occurred without fault on the part of the defendant. It was held that
the parties had accepted a contractual obligation not to disobey the sailing rules with the
result that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for the loss suffered as a result of the
breach and, further, that the effect of the agreement between the parties was to displace
the limitation on liability which would otherwise have been applicable as a result of the
application of a statutory provision. It is important to note that the issue in this case was
not one between one of the competitors and the organizers of the competition. Rather, it
was between two of the competitors and the question for the court was one that related
to the terms of the contract concluded between the competitors.
How was this contract formed? No clear answer can be given. Different views were
expressed in the Court of Appeal. Lord Esher MR stated (at p. 255) that the competitors
were bound when they began to sail and not before then. Lopes LJ concluded (at p. 261)
that the contract arose ‘directly any owner entered his yacht to sail’. Finally, Rigby LJ
stated (at p. 262) that the contract was created when the parties ‘actually came forward
and became competitors’. The House of Lords did not devote much attention to the
precise mechanism by which the contract was created. Only Lord Herschell considered
the matter and he did so very briefly. He stated (at p. 63):
I cannot entertain any doubt that there was a contractual relation between the parties to this litigation. The
effect of their entering for the race, and undertaking to be bound by these rules to the knowledge of each other,
is sufficient, I think, where those rules indicate a liability on the part of the one to the other, to create a
contractual obligation to discharge that liability.
The difficulty in using the tools of offer and acceptance to explain how the contract
between the parties came into being has been expressed by Treitel, 
The Law of Contract
(15th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited by Edwin Peel), para 2–077 in the following
terms:
It was held that there was a contract between all the competitors on the terms of the undertaking [to obey
certain rules during the race], though it is not clear whether the contract was made when the competitors
entered their yachts or when they actually began to race. In either event, it is difficult to analyse the transaction
into offer and acceptance. If the contract was made when the yachts were entered, one would have to say that
the entry of the first competitor was an offer and that the entry of the next was an acceptance of that offer and
(simultaneously) an offer to yet later competitors; but this view is artificial and unworkable even in theory
unless each competitor knew of the existence of previous ones. It would also lead to the conclusion that entries
which were put in the post together were cross-offers and thus not binding on each other.
 
If the contract was
made when the race began, then it seems that each competitor simultaneously agreed to terms proposed by the
officers of the 
club, and not that each proposed an identical set of terms amounting at the same time to an offer
to the others and to an acceptance of the offers at that instant made by them. Even if the second view of the facts
could be taken, the ‘offers’ and ‘acceptances’ would all occur at the same moment. Thus they would be cross-
offers and would not create a contract. The competitors, no doubt, reached agreement, but they did not do so by
a process which can be analysed into offer and acceptance.
What conclusion should we draw from the fact that it appears that not all contracts can
be (easily) analysed in terms of offer and acceptance? We could decide either to abandon
the offer and acceptance model in its entirety or we could recognize that, while offer and
acceptance is the usual means by which a contract is created, it is not the only one. The
first of these alternatives is a radical one. Nevertheless, it must be conceded that the
offer and acceptance model has been the subject of some criticism. For example,
Professor Collins states (
The Law of Contract
 
(4th edn, Butterworths, 2003), p. 159)
that:
To decide when consent has been given by both parties to a contract, the authors of traditional textbooks
devised an intricate set of rules employing the concepts of ‘offer and acceptance’ to fix the moment of
responsibility. These rules typify the formalist qualities of classical law: they are detailed, technical, and
mysterious, yet claim logical derivation from the idea of agreement.
As we shall see, the rules are at times detailed and technical and they are susceptible to
criticism on the ground that they appear to be rather mechanical and divorced from
commercial reality. In many ways, the difficulty lies in formulating an alternative to the
rules that are currently applied by the courts. There have been calls for the adoption of a
broader approach which focuses on the question of whether or not the parties have
reached agreement (see, for example, the approach of Lord Denning in 
Gibson
 
v.
Manchester City Council
 
extracted earlier). The problem with the latter suggestion is
that it tends to create uncertainty, in that it can often be very difficult to determine
whether or not the parties have, in fact, reached agreement. There is a need for clear
rules so that lawyers and their clients can know where they stand and do not have to
2
(a)
(b)
resort to litigation in order to be able to ascertain their rights and liabilities (see, for
example, 
Tekdata Interconnections Ltd
 
v. 
Amphenol Ltd
 
[2009] EWCA Civ 1209,
[2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 357, at [25]). Thus there is a general reluctance to abandon the old
rules in their entirety.
The more likely option is the second one, namely to recognize offer and acceptance as
the principal but not the only route by which a contract can be created. However, even
here, the courts tend to be reluctant to displace the traditional analysis (see, for
example, 
Tekdata Interconnections Ltd
 
v. 
Amphenol Ltd
). It is probably true to say that
the courts continue to employ the offer and acceptance rule-book but, as Lord
Wilberforce put it in the extract from 
The Eurymedon
, sometimes force the facts to fit
uneasily into the marked slots of offer and acceptance.
An alternative approach is overt recognition of the fact that offer and acceptance are
sufficient but not necessary ingredients of a valid contract. Thus Article 2.1.1 of the
Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts states that ‘[a] contract may
be concluded 
either
 
by the acceptance of an offer 
or by conduct of the parties that is
sufficient to show 
agreement
’ (emphasis added). The Principles of European Contract
Law arrive at the same conclusion but by a slightly more elaborate route. Article 2:101
provides that:
[i] A contract is concluded if:
the parties intend to be legally bound, and
they reach a sufficient agreement
without any further requirement.
Section 2 of Article 2 then sets out a number of rules relating to offer and acceptance
and, in doing so, recognizes that offer and acceptance is the usual model for the creation
of a contract. But section 2 concludes with the following provision (Article 2:211):
The rules in this Section apply with appropriate adaptations even though the process of conclusion of a contract
cannot be analysed into offer and acceptance.
At first sight this provision seems rather unhelpful in that it does not tell us what
constitutes an ‘appropriate adaptation’ of the rules otherwise applicable. But it is in fact
very difficult to provide more concrete guidance, other than to state that the otherwise
applicable rules should be applied by way of analogy to the facts of the case. English law
can learn at least two important lessons from the provisions on formation of contracts to
be found in the Unidroit Principles and the Principles of European Contract Law. The
first is that neither rejects the offer and acceptance analysis. On the contrary, they both
recognize that it is the usual mode of analysis but also accept the need for provision to
be made for agreements that cannot be accommodated within the offer and acceptance
framework. The second is that they both inject greater flexibility into the offer and
acceptance rules themselves and also provide some tailor-made solutions to well-known
and frequently encountered problems in commercial practice (see, for example, the
battle of the forms at 
3.3.1
).
3.1.2
 
The Intention of the Parties
The courts frequently declare that they are seeking to give effect to the intention of the
parties when applying the rules of offer and acceptance. It is, however, important to
understand that the courts do not generally seek to ascertain the subjective intentions of
the parties. It is their intention, objectively ascertained, that counts (on which see
further 
2.1
). But there is a problem here and it arises from the fact that the parties may
not have had any observable intention one way or the other. Take the case of a couple
going into a restaurant for a meal. They look at the menu outside the restaurant and
then decide to go in. When they go in a waiter gives them a copy of the menu and awaits
their order. They each order their meals. Nothing is said about who is to pay for the
meal. At the end of the meal the waiter presents a bill to one or other party and payment
is made. At what point in time did a contract come into existence between the customers
and the restaurant owner? Was it when the customers entered into the restaurant, when
they ordered the food, or when they paid for the meal? Further, how was the contract
created? Who made the offer and who accepted it? What is the status of the menu
(either outside or inside the restaurant)? Is it an offer or is it simply an 
invitation to
negotiate (or, as it is more commonly put by lawyers, an invitation to ‘treat’)? Who has
concluded the contract? Is the contract between the restaurant owner and the party who
pays the bill, or are both customers party to a contract with the restaurant owner?
Reference to the intention of the parties is unlikely to yield many answers to these
questions. The average customer in a restaurant is unlikely to have given much thought
to the precise process by which a contract is created. He or she intends to eat a meal and
to pay for it but, beyond this, is unlikely to have any discernible intention as to the
means by which or the time at which the contract is created. It falls to the courts to
devise a presumptive rule that can then be applied to the facts of the case at hand. In
this way uncertainty and inconsistency can be reduced, if not eliminated. In devising the
presumptive rule, the courts attempt to produce a rule which is workable and consistent
with what they believe would have been the intention of the parties had they given the
matter some thought. Oddly enough, there is in fact no authority on the contractual
status of a menu displayed or handed to a customer in a restaurant. The consensus of
academic opinion is that a menu amounts to an invitation to negotiate, not an offer.
3.1.3
 
The Inter-Related Nature of the Rules
It is easy to get the impression that the courts apply the offer and acceptance rules in a
rather mechanical fashion. The court first looks for an offer and, having found that, it
then moves on to look for a matching acceptance. If it finds an acceptance then a
contract is concluded; if not, no contract has been concluded. But it does not follow from
this that the rules applicable to offers and those applicable to acceptances exist in
splendid isolation. They are vitally inter-related. A simple example is provided by one of
the rules relating to the revocability of an offer. As a general rule, an offer can be
revoked at any time before it is accepted. Thus a court asked to determine whether an
offer has been validly revoked must first decide whether or not the offer has been
accepted. If the offer has been accepted, then it cannot be revoked and there is a binding
contract in existence between the parties. The readier the court is to find the existence of
an acceptance, the less room there is likely to be for the withdrawal of an offer.
A number of cases in this chapter raise issues relating both to the existence of an offer
and to the existence of an acceptance. One example is the decision of the Court of
Appeal in 
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic Smoke Ball Company
 
[1893] 1 QB 256 (see 
3.2.1
) where the
court was asked to decide, first, whether the defendant had made an offer to the plaintiff
and, secondly, assuming that such an offer had been made, whether the plaintiff had
validly accepted it. The extracts do not attempt to separate out the issues relating to the
existence of an offer from those relating to the existence of an acceptance where they
arise within a single case. They are treated together and this is done for the purpose of
emphasizing the fact that the issues are inter-related in practice.
3.1.4
 
The Time at Which the Contract Was
Created
It has been argued that the rules of contract law, and in particular the offer and
acceptance rules, attach undue significance to the precise moment in time at which the
contract between the parties was concluded. They appear to posit a world in which
parties suddenly transform themselves from negotiating parties into contracting parties.
Thus Professor Macneil has argued (‘Contracts: Adjustments of Long-Term Economic
Relations under 
Classical, Neoclassical and Relational Contract Law’ (1978) 72
Northwestern University Law Review
 
854, 864) that:
classical contract law draws clear lines between being in and not being in a transaction; e.g., rigorous and
precise rules of offer and acceptance prevail with no half-way houses where only some contract interests are
protected or where losses are shared.
This classical model may not fit with the practice of many commercial parties.
Relationships evolve rather than suddenly spring into existence. Thus many contracts
may not have a clearly defined beginning because the relationship between the parties
gradually develops as the negotiation process unfolds. Equally, they may not have a
clearly defined duration because the relationship between the parties will continue to
evolve after the conclusion of the contract with the result that the contract itself will
undergo a process of modification or adaptation. The offer and acceptance model, it is
argued, does not capture the dynamic nature of the relationship between the parties. It
presents a static model of contracts that attempts to attribute the rights and liabilities of
the parties to one particular moment in time, namely the point in time at which the
contract was concluded.
While the moment at which the contract is formed is undoubtedly of importance its
significance should not be over-emphasized. It is important in the sense that it identifies
the moment in time at which the parties became subject to the duty to perform the
obligations as set out in their contract. But it does not follow from this that the parties
did not owe each other duties while they remained negotiating parties. As we shall see
(
Chapter 17
) the law does regulate the bargaining process and, while the duties owed by
negotiating parties to each other are not as extensive as those owed by contracting
parties, they cannot be dismissed as insignificant. Thus it is not as if the parties move
suddenly from a world in which they owe each other no duties to one in which they owe
each other full contractual duties. The law does reflect the different stages in the
evolution of the relationship between the parties by imposing on the parties different
obligations at the two principal stages in the evolution of their relationship (namely as
negotiating parties and then as contracting parties). It is also important to realize that
the contract agreed by the parties can have a substantial degree of flexibility built into it.
It is not necessarily static. In the case of a long-term contract the parties are unlikely to
be able to anticipate all the future events that are likely to impinge upon the
performance of the various obligations contained in the contract. Contracting parties
who anticipate that their relationship will endure for a long period of time are therefore
likely to have to phrase their contractual obligations in rather vague, aspirational terms
in order to enable them to deal with future but as yet unanticipated problems. Thus it is
not necessarily the case that the parties must take all of their decisions at the moment of
entry into the contract. They can build into the contract clauses that will enable them to
adjust their relationship in order to reflect the altered circumstances that may later
confront them.
3.1.5
 
Offer and Acceptance and the ‘Will Theory’
of Contract
The offer and acceptance rules, as we know them today, are linked with the will theory of
contract, particularly as that theory developed in the nineteenth century. The most
influential exponents of the will theory were the French jurist Robert-Joseph Pothier
and the German jurist Friedrich von Savigny. They attributed contractual liability to the
agreement or the mutual assent of the parties. The introduction of this theory made a
significant change to English contract law. Professor Simpson (‘Innovation in
Nineteenth Century Contract Law’ (1975) 91 
LQR
 
247, 257) has put the point in the
following way:
[T]he formation of a contract today is analysed in terms of offer and acceptance, an intention to create legal
relations and the doctrine of consideration. If these requirements are satisfied there is a contract and (subject to
various provisos) this gives rise to rights in the contracting parties for whose violation the law provides
remedies in the form of actions for damages, injunctions and decrees of specific performance. Now way back in
the sixteenth century when it all began the form of action for verbal or parol 
agreements
 
(to use a neutral term)
was an action for breach of promise, and the essentials involved were neatly stated in 
Goldring’s Case
 
(1856) by
the then Solicitor General, Egerton: ‘In every action upon the case upon a promise, there are three things
considerable, consideration, promise and breach of promise’. You will notice the fact that between then and
today we have moved from an essentially one-sided conception—a 
promise
 
broken—to an essentially two-sided
notion—a 
contract
 
broken. [Emphasis in the original.]
This perception of a contract in bilateral terms, as a product of the meeting of the minds
of the two parties, has not been without its critics. Thus Professor Ibbetson has stated (
A
Historical Introduction to the Law of Obligations
 
(Oxford University Press, 1999), pp.
221–222) that:
the great merit of the Will Theory was that it had a measure of intellectual coherence that the traditional
Common law wholly lacked, though this coherence had been to some extent bought at the expense of practical
common sense. Its greatest demerit was that it was imposed on the Common law from the outside rather than
generated from within. It embodied a model of contract law significantly different from the traditional English
exchange model, and there was considerable friction between the two theories. The Common law did not—of
course—simply discard elements that did not fit neatly into the theory but strained to squeeze them into it. The
result was a mess …
As an intellectual construct, the idea that contractual liability was based on the meeting of the parties’ minds
was reasonably satisfactory, but in practical terms it was rather more problematical. All too often it might occur
that what appeared to be a perfect agreement concealed a more ragged mixture of things on which the parties
agreed, things on which they disagreed, and things to which one or both of them had given no thought. This was
early recognized by Joseph Chitty, who borrowed from Archdeacon Paley the theory of objective agreement,
conveniently ignoring the fact that Paley’s whole theory of liability was completely at odds with the Will Theory
derived from Pothier. … The objective theory obviously sat ill with the theory that contractual liability stemmed
from the meeting of the minds of the parties; the difficulty was explained away by treating it as a rule of
evidence rather than a rule of substance, parties being estopped from denying that their words meant what they
appeared to mean.
The adoption of the will theory posed, and continues to pose, particular challenges for
unilateral contracts. Thus Professor Simpson has observed (‘Innovation in Nineteenth
Century Contract Law’ (1975) 91 
LQR
 
247, 261–262) that:
so far as what are now called unilateral contracts are concerned we must note that this category only comes into
the limelight when the notion of an action for breach of contract (in 
some
 
sense a two-sided thing) prevails over
the older idea of an action for breach of promise—a unilateral thing. When the paradigm becomes bilateral, the
one-sided contract attracts notice and attention as anomalous. So it continues to be regarded, and it is easy to
find examples of passages in works on contract which seem to deny the existence of contracts binding only one
side. The analysis of such transactions in terms of offer and acceptance was first suggested by counsel in
Williams
 
v. 
Carwardine
 
(1833), a case involving a promise of a reward. Such cases fitted easily into the older
model—they were cases involving promises in consideration of an act not yet performed—called a future or
executory consideration; the promise to the man who goes to York is first discussed in an assumpsit case in
1572. The application of the offer and acceptance analysis to such promises has never been happy; it only
became canonical late in the nineteenth century in the celebrated case of 
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic Smoke Ball Co
(1892).
The five features of the rules discussed earlier will surface at various points in this
chapter and you should bear them in mind when reading the rest of the chapter. It is
now time to turn to a more detailed examination of the rules relating to offer and
acceptance. We shall proceed in three stages. At the first stage (
3.2
) we shall consider
whether or not an offer has been made, at the second stage (
3.3
) we shall discuss what
constitutes an acceptance, and at the final stage (
3.4
) we shall consider whether an offer
has been validly withdrawn or terminated.

3.2
 
Has an Offer Been Made?
The first question that has to be answered when deciding whether or not a contract has
been concluded is whether or not an offer was made. The existence or otherwise of an
offer will depend upon the intention of the party alleged to have made the offer. Did he
intend to be bound by the terms that he has proposed to the other party or not? If he
did, then the statement is likely to be an offer. If he did not, then it is likely that he has
not made an offer but simply expressed a willingness to negotiate on the terms
proposed. The statement that the existence of an offer depends upon the intention of the
party alleged to have made the offer must be qualified in two important respects.
The first is that the courts are not generally concerned to ascertain the subjective
intention of the party alleged to have made the offer. A judge cannot establish what was
actually taking place in the minds of the parties. Rather he will examine the intention of
the party alleged to have made the offer, 
as that intention appears to others
. In other
words, the courts focus attention on the objective intention of the parties, not their
subjective intention (on which see further 
Chapter 2
).
Secondly, the party making the statement alleged to constitute the offer may not have
had in mind the distinction between an offer and an expression of a willingness to
negotiate when making his statement. In such a case the court must endeavour to
ascertain, as best it can, the intention of the party who made the statement. In some
cases this is a matter of examining the correspondence that has passed between the
parties with a view to determining whether or not an offer has been made. In other
cases, where the fact situation is one of everyday occurrence, such as the purchase of
goods in a supermarket, the courts tend to lay down what might be termed a prima facie
rule of law that they will apply when deciding whether or not an offer has been made.
This is not to say that this prima facie rule is invariably applied: it can be displaced by
evidence of contrary intent. The reason for the existence of these prima facie rules is
probably the need for certainty in commercial transactions. Parties need to know where
they stand and they would not be able to do so if the courts embarked upon a fresh
inquiry into the intention of the parties in each case involving a purchase of goods from
a supermarket. Much better to establish a prima facie rule so that parties can at least
know the general rule that is applicable to their case and can plan accordingly (or, as the
case may be, settle disputes that have occurred).
In terms of ascertaining whether or not an offer has been made it is perhaps best to
separate out those cases in which the court is asked to examine the correspondence that
has passed between the parties from the other cases. In the ‘correspondence’ cases the
courts tend to have more evidence to work from and their task is to examine the
correspondence that has passed between the parties with a view to determining whether
or not a statement has been made that amounts to an offer. The outcome of such cases
very much depends upon the facts of the individual case.
For example, in 
Harvey
 
v. 
Facey
 
[1893] AC 552 the plaintiffs sent a telegraph to the
defendant phrased as follows: ‘will you sell us Bumper Hall Pen? Telegraph lowest cash
price’. The defendant replied by telegraph stating: ‘Lowest cash price for Bumper Hall
Pen £900’. The plaintiffs in turn replied by telegraph in which they stated: ‘we agree to
buy Bumper Hall Pen for £900 asked for by you’. The defendant did not reply to this last
telegraph. It was held that no contract had been concluded between the parties for the
sale of Bumper Hall Pen. The first telegraph was a mere inquiry in which the plaintiffs
simply sought to ascertain whether or not the defendant was willing to sell and, if so, at
what price. The defendant’s response was not an offer to sell the property but a precise
answer to the question that had been asked of him. The mere statement of the lowest
price at which he was prepared to sell did not constitute an implied offer to sell at that
price to the person making the inquiry. The final telegraph sent by the plaintiffs was
therefore an offer, not an acceptance, and, not having been accepted by the defendant, it
could not give rise to a contract between the parties.
Another example of this process at work is provided by the decision of the House of
Lords in 
Gibson
 
v. 
Manchester City Council
 
[1979] 1 WLR 294. The plaintiff, a council
house tenant, alleged that he had entered into a contract with the defendant city council
for the purchase of the house in which he lived. The defendant denied that a contract
had been concluded for the sale of the house. There had been a number of
communications between the parties. The defendant initially sent out a brochure to
council house tenants who had previously expressed an interest in purchasing their
homes. The brochures contained a detachable form, to be completed by the tenant,
which asked the council to inform the tenant of the price at which the council was
willing to sell the house and also asked the council to provide tenants with details about
mortgage facilities. The plaintiff completed the form and sent it to the defendant. The
defendant replied to the plaintiff on 10 February 1971 in the following terms:
I refer to your request for details of the cost of buying your Council house. The Corporation may be prepared to
sell the house to you at the purchase price of £2,275 less 20% = £2,180 (freehold).
The details which you requested about a Corporation mortgage are as follows:-
Maximum mortgage the Corporation may grant: £2,177 repayable over 20 years …
This letter should not be regarded as a firm offer of a mortgage.
If you would like to make formal application to buy your Council house, please complete the enclosed
application form and return it to me as soon as possible.
The letter was signed by the City Treasurer. The plaintiff completed the application form
and returned it. However, he left the purchase price of the house blank. The reason for
this was that he wanted to know whether or not the council intended to repair the
tarmac paths in the vicinity of the house and, if not, he stated that he was prepared to
carry out the work himself provided that an appropriate deduction was made from the
purchase price. The council replied to the effect that the price quoted took account of the
present condition of the property and that they could not authorize the repair of the
paths. The plaintiff replied to this in a letter in which he stated that ‘in view of your
remarks I would be obliged if you will carry on with the purchase as per my application
already in your possession’. Before the council was able to reply to the plaintiff’s letter
there was a change in the political composition of the council as a result of local
elections and the policy of selling council houses was promptly stopped by the incoming
Labour administration. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant council was obliged to
sell him the council house on the ground that a contract had been concluded for the sale
of the house before the policy of selling council houses had been stopped. The defendant
council denied that a contract had been concluded. The plaintiff succeeded before the
Court of Appeal but failed in the House of Lords.
The judges in the House of Lords undertook a careful examination of the
correspondence which had passed between the parties. Particular attention was paid to
the defendant’s letter of 10 February. The plaintiff submitted that it was an offer but this
submission was rejected for two principal reasons. The first was that the letter did not
commit the council to the sale of the property. According to the second sentence of the
letter the position of the council was that it ‘may’ be prepared to sell. This did not
amount to a commitment to sell. The second was that the final sentence of the letter
invited the plaintiff to make a formal application. It did not invite him to accept the offer
contained in the letter. This being the case the council never offered to sell the council
house to the plaintiff, nor did it accept any offer made by him to purchase the house. It
therefore followed that no contract had been concluded between the parties.
It is possible to criticize the decision on the ground that it focused unduly on a precise
construction of the documentation that passed between the parties and failed to pay
sufficient attention to their conduct (in particular, the fact that the plaintiff had done
‘much work in repairing and improving his house and premises’ and the fact that the
council had, at one point in time, taken the house off the list of houses being maintained
by them and put it on the list of ‘pending sales’). Lord Edmund-Davies did, however,
address these points. He stated that it was impossible to conclude on the evidence that
improvements had been carried out on the basis that the council had already committed
itself to sell the property. He also stated that the plaintiff could not place any reliance on
the fact that, unknown to him, 
the council had at one point taken the property off the list
of houses for which it was responsible for maintenance and put it on the list of ‘pending
sales’.
In other cases the courts have evolved prima facie rules of law to be applied to certain
standard types of transaction in order to determine whether or not there has been an
offer or an invitation to negotiate. The cases that are discussed in the following sections
illustrate four commonplace transactions, namely (a) advertisements, (b) displays of
goods in shops, (c) auctions, and (d) tenders.

The general rule applicable to advertisements is that, at least in the case of bilateral
contracts, an advertisement constitutes an invitation to negotiate and not an offer. Thus,
to take the standard example, suppose that a vendor of goods advertises them for sale in
a local newspaper. The advertisement will generally be regarded as an invitation to
negotiate and not an offer (see 
Partridge
 
v. 
Crittenden
 
[1968] 1 WLR 1204). The
principal reason for this is said to be the need to protect the party placing the
advertisement from incurring a liability in contract to every person who is willing to
purchase the goods at the stipulated price. Thus in 
Grainger & Son
 
v. 
Gough (Surveyor
of Taxes)
 
[1896] AC 325, 334 Lord Herschell considered the case of a price-list
distributed by a merchant ‘among persons likely to give orders’ and concluded that:
[t]he transmission of such a price-list does not amount to an offer to supply an unlimited quantity of the wine
described at the price named, so that as soon as an order is given there is a binding contract to supply that
quantity. If it were so, the merchant might find himself involved in any number of contractual obligations to
supply wine of a particular description which he would be quite unable to carry out, his stock of wine of that
description being necessarily limited.
While there is obvious force in the point that there is a need to protect the vendor from
potential multiple liability, this could have been done in another way. It did not demand
that the advertisement be classified as an invitation to negotiate. It could have been
done by treating the advertisement as an offer but then implying into that offer a term to
the effect that the offer can only be accepted ‘while stocks last’. One consequence of
choosing to regard an advertisement as an invitation to negotiate rather than an offer is
that the party who responds to the advertisement and is willing to purchase the goods at
their advertised price cannot compel the advertiser to sell the goods to him at the stated
price. He can only make an offer which the vendor can then choose either to accept or to
reject. It has also had unfortunate consequences in the context of the criminal law. For
example, in 
Partridge
 
v. 
Crittenden
 
[1968] 1 WLR 1204 the defendant was charged with
an offence of offering wild birds for sale contrary to the Protection of Birds Act 1954. The
advertisement placed by the defendant stated ‘Quality British A.B.C.R … Bramblefinch
cocks, Bramblefinch hens, 25s each’. It was held that he had not committed the offence
with which he was charged because he had not offered the birds for sale; the
advertisement was simply an invitation to negotiate. Legislators who wish to catch those
who advertise certain goods for sale must therefore extend the scope of the offence
beyond those who ‘offer’ goods for sale (thus the Consumer Protection from Unfair
Trading Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/1277) makes provision for a range of offences which
may be committed by a trader who provides misleading information of various types to
consumers).
The conclusion that an advertisement is an invitation to negotiate is not, however, an
invariable one. Cases can be found in which the courts have concluded that an
advertisement is an offer and not an invitation to negotiate. The leading case, to which
we now turn, is an example of a unilateral contract. The inference that an advertisement
is an offer rather than an invitation to negotiate will often be more readily drawn in the
context of a unilateral contract.
CARLILL V. CARBOLIC SMOKE BALL COMPANY
[1893] 1 QB 256, Court of Appeal
The defendants advertised their medicinal product, the now infamous ‘carbolic
smoke ball’, in various newspapers in the following terms:
‘100l. reward will be paid by the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company to any person who contracts the
increasing epidemic influenza, colds, or any disease caused by taking cold, after having used the ball
three times daily for two weeks according to the printed directions supplied with each ball. 1000l. is
deposited with the Alliance Bank, Regent Street, shewing our sincerity in the matter.
During the last epidemic of influenza many thousand carbolic smoke balls were sold as preventives
against this disease, and in no ascertained case was the disease contracted by those using the carbolic
smoke ball.
One carbolic smoke ball will last a family several months, making it the cheapest remedy in the world
at the price, 10s., post free. The ball can be refilled at a cost of 5s. Address, Carbolic Smoke Ball
Company, 27, Princes Street, Hanover Square, London.’
The plaintiff, in reliance upon this advertisement, purchased and used the product
as directed but subsequently caught influenza. She sued for payment of the £100
and succeeded before Hawkins J. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal
but the appeal was dismissed. It was held that the terms of the advertisement
constituted an offer, the terms of which were accepted by the plaintiff with the
result that she was entitled to recover the promised £100.
Bowen LJ
… We were asked to say that this document was a contract too vague to be enforced.
The first observation which arises is that the document itself is not a contract at all, it is only an offer
made to the public. The defendants contend next, that it is an offer the terms of which are too vague to
be treated as a definite offer, inasmuch as there is no limit of time fixed for the catching of the influenza,
and it cannot be supposed that the advertisers seriously meant to promise to pay money to every person
who catches the influenza at any time after the inhaling of the smoke ball. It was urged also, that if you
look at this document you will find much vagueness as to the persons with whom the contract was
intended to be made—that, in the first place, its terms are wide enough to include persons who may
have used the smoke ball before the advertisement was issued; at all events, that it is an offer to the
world in general, and, also, that it is unreasonable to suppose it to be a definite offer, because nobody in
their senses would contract themselves out of the opportunity of checking the experiment which was
going to be made at their own expense. It is also contended that the advertisement is rather in the nature
of a puff or a proclamation than a promise or offer intended to mature into a contract when accepted. 
But
the main point seems to be that the vagueness of the document shows that no contract whatever was
intended. It seems to me that in order to arrive at a right conclusion we must read this advertisement in
its plain meaning, as the public would understand it. It was intended to be issued to the public and to be
read by the public. How would an ordinary person reading this document construe it? It was intended
unquestionably to have some effect, and I think the effect which it was intended to have, was to make
people use the smoke ball, because the suggestions and allegations which it contains are directed
immediately to the use of the smoke ball as distinct from the purchase of it. It did not follow that the
smoke ball was to be purchased from the defendants directly, or even from agents of theirs directly. The
intention was that the circulation of the smoke ball should be promoted, and that the use of it should be
increased. The advertisement begins by saying that a reward will be paid by the Carbolic Smoke Ball
Company to any person who contracts the increasing epidemic after using the ball. It has been said that
the words do not apply only to persons who contract the epidemic after the publication of the
advertisement, but include persons who had previously contracted the influenza. I cannot so read the
advertisement. It is written in colloquial and popular language, and I think that it is equivalent to this:
‘100l. will be paid to any person who shall contract the increasing epidemic after having used the
carbolic smoke ball three times daily for two weeks’. And it seems to me that the way in which the public
would read it would be this, that if anybody, after the advertisement was published, used three times
daily for two weeks the carbolic smoke ball, and then caught cold, he would be entitled to the reward.
Then again it was said: ‘How long is this protection to endure? Is it to go on for ever, or for what limit of
time?’ I think that there are two constructions of this document, each of which is good sense, and each of
which seems to me to satisfy the exigencies of the present action. It may mean that the protection is
warranted to last during the epidemic, and it was during the epidemic that the plaintiff contracted the
disease. I think, more probably, it means that the smoke ball will be a protection while it is in use. That
seems to me the way in which an ordinary person would understand an advertisement about medicine,
and about a specific against influenza. It could not be supposed that after you have left off using it you
are still to be protected for ever, as if there was to be a stamp set upon your forehead that you were
never to catch influenza because you had once used the carbolic smoke ball. I think the immunity is to
last during the use of the ball. That is the way in which I should naturally read it, and it seems to me that
the subsequent language of the advertisement supports that construction. It says: ‘During the last
epidemic of influenza many thousand carbolic smoke balls were sold, and in no ascertained case was
the disease contracted by those using’ (not ‘who had used’) ‘the carbolic smoke ball’, and it concludes
with saying that one smoke ball will last a family several months (which imports that it is to be efficacious
while it is being used), and that the ball can be refilled at a cost of 5s. I, therefore, have myself no
hesitation in saying that I think, on the construction of this advertisement, the protection was to enure
during the time that the carbolic smoke ball was being used. My brother, [Lord Justice Lindley], thinks
that the contract would be sufficiently definite if you were to read it in the sense that the protection was to
be warranted during a reasonable period after use. I have some difficulty myself on that point; but it is
not necessary for me to consider it further, because the disease here was contracted during the use of
the carbolic smoke ball.
Was it intended that the 100l. should, if the conditions were fulfilled, be paid? The advertisement says
that 1000l. is lodged at the bank for the purpose. Therefore, it cannot be said that the statement that
100l. would be paid was intended to be a mere puff. I think it was intended to be understood by the
public as an offer which was to be acted upon.
But it was said there was no check on the part of the persons who issued the advertisement, and that
it would be an insensate thing to promise 100l. to a person who used the smoke ball unless you could
check or superintend his manner of using it. The answer to that argument seems to me to be that if a
person chooses to make extravagant promises of this kind he probably does so because it pays him to
make them, and, if he has made them, the extravagance of the promises is no reason in law why he
should not be bound by them.
It was also said that the contract is made with all the world—that is, with everybody; and that you
cannot contract with everybody. It is not a contract made with all the world. There is the fallacy of the
argument. It is an offer made to all the world; and why should not an offer be made to all the world which
is to ripen into a contract with anybody who comes forward and performs the condition? It is an offer to
become liable to any one who, before it is retracted, performs the condition, and, although the offer is
made to the world, the contract is made with that limited portion of the public who come forward and
perform the condition on the faith of the advertisement. It is not like cases in which you offer to negotiate,
or you issue advertisements that you have got a stock of books to sell, or houses to let, in which case
there is no offer to be bound by any contract. Such advertisements are offers to negotiate—offers to
receive offers—offers to chaffer, as, I think, some learned judge in one of the cases has said. If this is an
offer to be bound, then it is a contract the moment the person fulfils the condition …
Then it was said that there was no notification of the acceptance of the contract. One cannot doubt
that, as an ordinary rule of law, an acceptance of an offer made ought to be notified to the person who
makes the offer, in order that the two minds may come together. Unless this is done the two minds may
be apart, and there is not that consensus which is necessary according to the English law—I say nothing
about the laws of other countries—to make a contract. But there is this clear gloss to be made upon that
doctrine, that as notification of acceptance is required for the benefit of the person who makes the offer,
the person who makes the offer may dispense with notice to himself if he thinks it desirable to do so, and
I suppose there can be no doubt that where a person in an offer made by him to another person,
expressly or impliedly intimates a particular mode of acceptance as sufficient to make the bargain
binding, it is only necessary for the other person to whom such offer is made to follow the indicated
method of acceptance; and if the person making the offer, expressly or impliedly intimates in his offer
that it will be sufficient to act on the proposal without communicating acceptance of it to himself,
performance of the condition is a sufficient acceptance without notification …
Now, if that is the law, how are we to find out whether the person who makes the offer does intimate
that notification of acceptance will not be necessary in order to constitute a binding bargain? In many
cases you look to the offer itself. In many cases you extract from the character of the transaction that
notification is not required, and in the advertisement cases it seems to me to follow as an inference to be
drawn from the transaction itself that a person is not to notify his acceptance of the offer before he
performs the condition, but that if he performs the condition notification is dispensed with. It seems to me
that from the point of view of common sense no other idea could be entertained. If I advertise to the
world that my dog is lost, and that anybody who brings the dog to a particular place will be paid some
money, are all the police or other persons whose business it is to find lost dogs to be expected to sit
down and write me a note saying that they have accepted my proposal? Why, of course, they at once
look for the dog, and as soon as they find the dog they have performed the condition. The essence of
the transaction is that the dog should be found, and it is not necessary under such circumstances, as it
seems to me, that in order to make the contract binding there 
should be any notification of acceptance. It
follows from the nature of the thing that the performance of the condition is sufficient acceptance without
the notification of it, and a person who makes an offer in an advertisement of that kind makes an offer
which must be read by the light of that common sense reflection. He does, therefore, in his offer
impliedly indicate that he does not require notification of the acceptance of the offer.

Commentary
It should be noted that a number of legal issues arose on the facts of 
Carlill
, not all of
which were concerned with the question whether or not the advertisement constituted
an offer. This is not surprising. Most litigation generates more than one point of law. A
number of distinct issues of law were raised by the facts of 
Carlill
. These issues are: (i)
did the defendants intend to be bound by the terms stated in their advertisement? (ii)
did Mrs Carlill validly accept the offer contained in the advertisement? (iii) did Mrs
Carlill provide any consideration for the promise contained in the offer? One of the
arguments advanced by the defendants in support of their submission that the
advertisement did not constitute an offer was that it was too vague to be enforceable.
This argument was rejected on the facts. But what would have been the position if Mrs
Carlill had caught influenza some six months after using the smoke ball? Would the
defendants have been liable to pay the £100? Lindley LJ concluded (at p. 264) that the
reward was offered to ‘any person who contracts the epidemic or other disease within a
reasonable time after having used the smoke ball’, while A. L. Smith LJ stated (at p. 274)
that he found it unnecessary to resolve this point. What was the opinion of Bowen LJ on
this particular issue?
As Professor Simpson has noted (‘Quackery and Contract Law: 
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic Smoke
Ball Company
’ in 
Leading Cases in the Common Law
 
(Oxford University Press, 1995),
p. 259), 
Carlill
 
has achieved the status of a leading case. He attributes this status in part
to ‘the comic and slightly mysterious object involved’. This is undoubtedly true.
Professor Simpson locates the case in the context of the great influenza epidemic of the
1890s and the ‘seedy world of the late nineteenth-century vendors of patent medical
appliances’. Thus he records (at p. 274) the verdict of the 
Lancet
 
to the decision of the
court at first instance:
To those amongst our readers who are familiar with the way of the quack medicine vendor the facts proved the
other day by Mrs Carlill in the action she has brought against the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company will occasion no
surprise. … We are glad to learn that in spite of the ingenuity of their legal advisers the defendants have been
held liable to make good their promise.
These factors no doubt played their part in persuading the court to find for Mrs Carlill.
However, Professor Simpson is careful to point out that the interest in the case does not
lie solely in its rather bizarre facts. He adds (at p. 281) that there:
were two reasons of a legal character that suggest that it deserves its place in the firmament. The first, which is
not always fully appreciated, is historical; it was the vehicle whereby a new legal doctrine was introduced into
the law of contract. The second is that the decision could be used by expositors of the law of contract to
illustrate the arcane mysteries surrounding the conception of a unilateral or one-sided contract.
In making the claim that 
Carlill
 
introduced a ‘new legal doctrine’ into the law of
contract, Professor Simpson asserts that the case ‘clearly recognized the requirement of
an intention to create legal relations’. As we shall see (
7.2
), the case which is generally
cited as authority for the existence of the doctrine of intention to create legal relations is
the later case of 
Balfour
 
v. 
Balfour
 
[1919] 2 KB 571. However, Professor Simpson points
out that counsel for the defendants in 
Carlill
 
submitted that ‘the defendants did not by
issuing [the advertisement] mean to impose upon themselves any obligations
enforceable by law’. Bowen LJ rejected this submission (as did the other judges) on the
ground that the advertisement was not a ‘mere puff’ but was ‘intended to be understood
by the public as an offer which was to be acted upon’. Professor Simpson then concludes
(at p. 282) that ‘the fact that the judges found it necessary to make this point entailed
their acceptance of the idea that, without an intention to create legal relations, there
could be no actionable contract’. This point is perhaps debatable but it is now an
academic one given that English contract law clearly recognizes the existence of such a
doctrine. But there does appear to be a link between 
Carlill
 
and the doctrine of intention
to create legal relations (see, for example, 
Bowerman
 
v. 
Association of British Travel
Agents Ltd
 
[1996] CLC 451), although it is probably fair to say that the recognition of the
doctrine is implicit in the judgments in 
Carlill
 
rather than explicit.
Professor Simpson is perhaps on safer ground with his second claim, namely that 
Carlill
illustrates the ‘mysteries surrounding the conception of a unilateral or one-sided
contract’. Thus he argues (at pp. 282–283) that:
most contracts that concern the courts involve two-sided agreements, two-sided in the sense that the parties
enter into reciprocal obligations to each other. A typical example is a sale of goods, where the seller has to
deliver the goods and the buyer to pay for them. The doctrines of nineteenth-century contract law were adapted
to such bilateral contracts, but the law also somewhat uneasily recognized that there could be contracts in which
only one party was ever under any obligation to the other. The standard example was a published promise to
pay a reward for information on the recovery of lost property: £10 to anyone who finds and returns my dog. In
such a case obviously nobody has to search for the dog, but if they do so successfully, they are entitled to the
reward. Such contracts seem odd in another way; there is a promise, but no agreement for the parties never
even meet until the reward is claimed. Classified as ‘unilateral’ contracts, such arrangements presented special
problems of analysis to contract theorists, whose standard doctrines had not been evolved to fit them. Thus it
was by 1892 orthodox to say that all contracts were formed by the exchange of an offer and an acceptance, but it
was by no means easy to see how this could be true of unilateral contracts, where there was, to the eyes of
common sense, no acceptance needed.
The analytical problems arose in a particularly acute form in the smoke ball case. Thus it seemed very
peculiar to say there had been any sort of agreement between Mrs Carlill and the company, which did not even
know of her existence until … her husband wrote to them to complain. There were, indeed, earlier cases
permitting the recovery of advertised rewards; the leading case here was 
Williams
 
v. 
Carwardine
, where a
reward of £20 had been promised by handbill for information leading to the conviction of the murderer of
Walter Carwardine, and Williams, who gave such information, successfully sued to recover the reward. But this
was long before the doctrines which made unilateral contracts problematic had become established, and in any
event the case was distinguishable. It concerned a reward, whereas Mrs Carlill was seeking compensation.
Furthermore, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company had no chance of checking the validity of claims, of which there
could be an indefinite number; much was made of this point in argument. But the judges were not impressed;
their attitude was no doubt influenced by the view that the defendants were rogues. They fitted their decision
into the structure 
of the law by boldly declaring that the performance of the condition—using the ball and
getting ill—was the acceptance, thus fictitiously extending the concept of acceptance to cover the facts. And,
since 1893, law students have been introduced to the mysteries of the unilateral contract through the vehicle of
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic Smoke Ball Company
 
and taught to repeat, as a sort of magical incantation of contract law,
that in the case of unilateral contracts performance of the act specified in the offer constitutes acceptance, and
need not be communicated to the offeror.
In relation to the existence of a valid acceptance, two principal problems arose on the
facts of 
Carlill
. The first related to the identification of the acceptance. How and when
did Mrs Carlill accept the offer contained in the advertisement? Did she accept the offer
when she purchased the smoke ball, when she used it for the first time, or only when she
completed the course? Bowen LJ appeared to take the latter view. This issue is
important not only in relation to the existence of an offer, but also for the ability of the
defendants to revoke the offer contained in their advertisement. As we shall see (
3.4
),
the general rule is that an offer cannot be revoked once it has been accepted. But if
acceptance does not take place until the completion of the course then the defendants
may be entitled to revoke the offer even in the case where the purchaser has begun to
use the smoke ball. The second problem concerned the communication of the
acceptance. As we shall see (
3.3.2
), the general rule is that an acceptance, to be valid,
must be communicated to the party who made the offer. This rule was held not to be
applicable to Mrs Carlill because the terms of the offer demonstrated that the need for
communication had been waived by the defendants (see to similar effect 
Attrill
 
v.
Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 394, [2013] 3 All ER 607, [98]–[99]).
Finally, it should be noted that the defendants argued that there was no consideration
for their promise (the doctrine of consideration is discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 5
).
In essence the doctrine of consideration requires the existence of a bargain between the
parties. In other words, both parties must have contributed something towards the
agreement. The Court of Appeal held that there was consideration on two grounds. The
first was the benefit that the defendants gained as a result of the use of the smoke ball in
response to the advertisements and the sales produced thereby. The second was that the
use by Mrs Carlill of the smoke ball three times daily for two weeks constituted a
detriment so that she had provided consideration for the defendants’ promise.
3.2.2
 
Displays of Goods for Sale in a Shop
The general rule in relation to the display of goods for sale in a shop is that the display
constitutes an invitation to negotiate and not an offer. The leading case is:
PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF GREAT BRITAIN V.
BOOTS CASH CHEMISTS
[1953] 1 QB 401, Court of Appeal
Section 18(1) of the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 provided that:
‘it shall not be lawful—(a) for a person to sell any poison included in Part I of the Poisons List, unless—(i)
he is an authorized seller of poisons; and (ii) the sale is effected on premises duly registered under Part I
of this Act; and (iii) the sale is effected by, or under the supervision of, a registered pharmacist.’
The plaintiffs brought an action against the defendants in which they alleged that
the defendants had infringed section 18(1)(a)(iii) of the Act on the basis that the
sale of poisons in the defendants’ self-service store was not effected by, nor did it
take place under the supervision of, a registered pharmacist. The pharmacist was
not present at the cash desk. He was stationed close to the poisons section and in
view of the cash desks and he was authorized by the defendants to prevent the
sale of any drug (although customers were not aware of the fact that he was so
authorized). On 13 April 1951 two customers purchased medicines which fell within
the scope of the Act and the issue for the court was whether or not these sales
were effected by or under the supervision of a registered pharmacist. The Court of
Appeal, affirming the decision of Lord Chief Justice Goddard, concluded that they
had been so effected.
Somervell LJ
This is an appeal from a decision of the Lord Chief Justice on an agreed statement of facts, raising a
question under section 18(1)(a)(iii) of the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. The plaintiffs are the
Pharmaceutical Society, incorporated by Royal charter. One of their duties is to take all reasonable steps
to enforce the provisions of the Act. The provision in question is contained in section 18.
[His Lordship read the section and stated the facts, and continued]
It is not disputed that in a chemist’s shop where this self-service system does not prevail a customer
may go in and ask a young woman assistant, who will not herself be a registered pharmacist, for one of
these articles on the list, and the transaction may be completed and the article paid for, although the
registered pharmacist, who will no doubt be on the premises, will not know anything himself of the
transaction, unless the assistant serving the customer, or the customer, requires to put a question to him.
It is right that I should emphasize, as did the Lord Chief Justice, that these are not dangerous drugs.
They are substances which contain very small proportions of poison, and I imagine that many of them
are the type of drug which has a warning as to what doses are to be taken. They are drugs which can be
obtained, under the law, without a doctor’s prescription.
The point taken by the plaintiffs is this: it is said that the purchase is complete if and when a customer
going round the shelves takes an article and puts it in the receptacle which he or she is carrying, and
that therefore, if that is right, when the customer comes to the pay desk, having completed the tour of the
premises, the registered pharmacist, if so minded, has no power to say: ‘This drug ought not to be sold
to this customer’. Whether and in what circumstances he would have that power we need not inquire, but
one can, of course, see that there is a difference if supervision can only be exercised at a time when the
contract is completed.
I agree with the Lord Chief Justice in everything that he said, but I will put the matter shortly in my
own words. Whether the view contended for by the plaintiffs is a right view depends on what are the
legal implications of this layout—the invitation to the customer. Is a contract to be regarded as being
completed when the article is put into the receptacle, or is this to be regarded as a more organized way
of doing what is done already in many types of shops—and a bookseller is perhaps the best example—
namely, enabling customers to have free access to what is in the shop, to look at the different articles,
and then, ultimately, having got the ones which they wish to buy, to come up to the assistant saying ‘I
want this’? The assistant in 999 times out of 1,000 says ‘That is all right’, and the money passes and the
transaction is completed. I agree with what the Lord Chief Justice has said, and with the reasons which
he has given for his conclusion, that in the case of an ordinary shop, although goods are displayed and it
is intended that customers should go and choose what they want, 
the contract is not completed until, the
customer having indicated the articles which he needs, the shopkeeper, or someone on his behalf,
accepts that offer. Then the contract is completed. I can see no reason at all, that being clearly the
normal position, for drawing any different implication as a result of this layout.
The Lord Chief Justice, I think, expressed one of the most formidable difficulties in the way of the
plaintiffs’ contention when he pointed out that, if the plaintiffs are right, once an article has been placed in
the receptacle the customer himself is bound and would have no right, without paying for the first article,
to substitute an article which he saw later of a similar kind and which he perhaps preferred. I can see no
reason for implying from this self-service arrangement any implication other than that which the Lord
Chief Justice found in it, namely, that it is a convenient method of enabling customers to see what there
is and choose, and possibly put back and substitute, articles which they wish to have, and then to go up
to the cashier and offer to buy what they have so far chosen. On that conclusion the case fails, because
it is admitted that there was supervision in the sense required by the Act and at the appropriate moment
of time. For these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.

Commentary
It should be noted that the claim was not one between a purchaser of goods in a shop
and the shop itself. Rather, it was an action between the plaintiffs, the professional
association of pharmacists, and the defendant pharmacists and the context was one of
an allegation of unlawful conduct by the defendants. Thus the claim made by the
plaintiffs was not one of breach of contract but that the defendants had acted in
contravention of a duty imposed on them by statute.
In terms of the outcome of the case, the important factor was the place at which the
contract was concluded, rather than the precise way in which the contract was
concluded. It sufficed for the court to decide that the contract was concluded at the cash-
desk and thus under the supervision of the pharmacist. The court could have concluded
that the offer was made by the shop in displaying the goods for sale at fixed prices but
that the offer was not accepted by the customer until the goods were taken to the cash-
desk. In such a case the contract would still have been concluded under the supervision
of the pharmacist. But this was not the reasoning that the court chose to employ. It
treated the display as an invitation to negotiate and stated that the offer was made by
the customer which the defendants could then decide whether to accept or reject. The
fullest analysis of the process by which the contract was formed was provided by Lord
Goddard CJ at first instance when he said ([1952] 2 All ER 456, 458):
It is a well-established principle that the mere fact that a shop-keeper exposes goods which indicate to the
public that he is willing to treat does not amount to an offer to sell. I do not think that I ought to hold that there
has been here a complete reversal of that principle merely because a self-service scheme is in operation. In my
opinion, what was done here came to no more than that the customer was informed that he could pick up an
article and bring it to the shop-keeper, the contract for sale being completed if the shop-keeper accepted the
customer’s offer to buy. The offer is an offer to buy, not an offer to sell. The fact that the supervising pharmacist
is at the place where the money has to be paid is an indication that the purchaser may or may not be informed
that the shop-keeper is willing to complete the contract. One has to apply common sense and the ordinary
principles of commerce in this matter. 
If one were to hold that in the case of self-service shops the contract was
complete directly the purchaser picked up the article, serious consequences might result. The property would
pass to him at once and he would be able to insist on the shop-keeper allowing him to take it away, even where
the shop-keeper might think it very undesirable. On the other hand, once a person had picked up an article, he
would never be able to put it back and say that he had changed his mind. The shop-keeper could say that the
property had passed and he must buy.
It seems to me, therefore, that it makes no difference that a shop is a self-service shop and that the
transaction is not different from the normal transaction in a shop. The shop-keeper is not making an offer to
sell every article in the shop to any person who may come in, and such person cannot insist on buying by saying;
‘I accept your offer’. Books are displayed in a bookshop and customers are invited to pick them up and look at
them even if they do not actually buy them. There is no offer of the shop-keeper to sell before the customer has
taken the book to the shop-keeper or his assistant and said that he wants to buy it and the shop-keeper has said:
‘Yes’. That would not prevent the shop-keeper, seeing the book picked up from saying: ‘I am sorry I cannot let
you have that book. It is the only copy I have got, and I have already promised it to another customer.’
Therefore, in my opinion, the mere fact that a customer picks up a bottle of medicine from a shelf does not
amount to an acceptance of an offer to sell, but is an offer by the customer to buy. I feel bound also to say that
the sale here was made under the supervision of a pharmacist. There was no sale until the buyer’s offer to buy
was accepted by the acceptance of the purchase price, and that took place under the supervision of a
pharmacist.
In 
Fisher
 
v. 
Bell
 
[1961] 1 QB 394 the defendant was charged with the offence of offering
for sale a flick knife, contrary to section 1(1) of the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act
1959. He had displayed the knife in his shop window with a price ticket behind it which
stated ‘Ejector knife—4s’. It was held that the defendant had not committed the offence
with which he was charged because, in displaying the knife in his shop window, he had
not offered it for sale. Lord Parker CJ stated (at p. 400) that he found it ‘quite
impossible to say that an exhibition of goods in a shop window is itself an offer for sale’.
But it does not follow from these cases that a display of goods in a shop will never be
held to amount to an offer. There are cases in which the courts have held that a display
of goods, or an advertisement to the effect that goods will be sold at a particular price,
constitutes an offer. One such case is the following:
LEFKOWITZ V. GREAT MINNEAPOLIS SURPLUS
STORES INC
86 NW 2d 689 (1957) (Supreme Court of Minnesota)
Murphy J
This case grows out of the alleged refusal of the defendant to sell to the plaintiff a certain fur piece which
it had offered for sale in a newspaper advertisement. It appears from the record that on 6 April 1956, the
defendant published the following advertisement in a Minneapolis newspaper:
‘Saturday 9 a.m. sharp
3 Brand New
Fur
Coats
Worth to $ 100.00
First Come
First Served
$ 1
Each’
On 13 April, the defendant again published an advertisement in the same newspaper as follows:
‘Saturday 9 a.m.
2 Brand New Pastel
Mink 3-Skin Scarfs
Selling for $ 89.50
Out they go
Saturday. Each … $ 1.00
1 Black Lapin Stole
Beautiful,
worth $ 139.50. … $ 1.00
First Come
First Served’
The record supports the findings of the court that on each of the Saturdays following the publication of
the above-described advertisements the plaintiff was the first to present himself at the appropriate
counter in the defendant’s store and on each occasion demanded the coat and the stole so advertised
and indicated his readiness to pay the sale price of $1. On both occasions, the defendant refused to sell
the merchandise to the plaintiff, stating on the first occasion that by a ‘house rule’ the offer was intended
for women only and sales would not be made to men, and on the second visit that the plaintiff knew the
defendant’s house rules.
The trial court properly disallowed the plaintiff’s claim for the value of the fur coats since the value of
these articles was speculative and uncertain. The only evidence of value was the advertisement itself to
the effect that the coats were ‘Worth to $100.00’, how much less being speculative especially in view of
the price for which they were offered for sale. With reference to the offer of the defendant on April 13,
1956, to sell the ‘1 Black Lapin Stole … worth $139.50 … ’ the trial court held that the value of this article
was established and granted judgment in favor of the plaintiff for that amount less the $1 quoted
purchase price.
The defendant contends that a newspaper advertisement offering items of merchandise for sale at a
named price is a ‘unilateral offer’ which may be withdrawn without notice. He relies upon authorities
which hold that, where an advertiser publishes in a newspaper that he has a certain quantity or quality of
goods which he wants to dispose of at certain prices and on certain terms, such advertisements are not
offers which become contracts as soon as any person to whose notice they may come signifies his
acceptance by notifying the other that he will take a certain quantity of them. Such advertisements have
been construed as an invitation for an offer of sale on the terms stated, which offer, when received, may
be accepted or rejected and which therefore does not become a contract of sale until accepted by the
seller; and until a contract has been so made, the seller may modify or revoke such prices or terms …
There are numerous authorities which hold that a particular advertisement in a newspaper or circular
letter relating to a sale of articles may be construed by the court as constituting an offer, acceptance of
which would complete a contract …
The test of whether a binding obligation may originate in advertisements addressed to the general
public is ‘whether the facts show that some performance was promised in positive terms in return for
something requested’. 1 Williston, Contracts (rev. edn) § 27.
The authorities … emphasize that, where the offer is clear, definite, and explicit, and leaves nothing
open for negotiation, it constitutes an offer, acceptance of which will complete the contract. The most
recent case on the subject is 
Johnson
 
v. 
Capital City Ford Co
 
… in which the court pointed out that a
newspaper advertisement relating to the purchase and sale of automobiles may constitute an offer,
acceptance of which will consummate a contract and create an obligation in the offeror to perform
according to the terms of the published offer.
Whether in any individual instance a newspaper advertisement is an offer rather than an invitation to
make an offer depends on the legal intention of the parties and the surrounding circumstances. … We
are of the view on the facts before us that the offer by the defendant of the sale of the Lapin fur was
clear, definite, and explicit, and left nothing open for negotiation. The plaintiff having successfully
managed to be the first one to appear at the seller’s place of business to be served, as requested by the
advertisement, and having offered the stated purchase price of the article, he was entitled to
performance on the part of the defendant. We think the trial court was correct in holding that there was in
the conduct of the parties a sufficient mutuality of obligation to constitute a contract of sale.
The defendant contends that the offer was modified by a ‘house rule’ to the effect that only women
were qualified to receive the bargains advertised. The advertisement contained no such restriction. This
objection may be disposed of briefly by stating that, while an advertiser has the right at any time before
acceptance to modify his offer, he does not have the right, after acceptance, to impose new or arbitrary
conditions not contained in the published offer.
How do the courts decide whether or not a display of goods in a shop amounts to an
offer or not? Is it a question of fact in each case? Does it depend solely on the intention
of the shopkeeper or does it depend upon policy considerations or value judgments?
Consider the following argument (Atiyah’s 
An Introduction to the Law of Contract
 
(6th
edn, Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 41–42):
[T]he question whether a display of goods in a self-service store amounts to an offer is itself a ‘conceptual’
question. The answer can have no meaning except in some legal context. The most usual context would be that
in which a shopkeeper refused to serve a customer (or perhaps refused to sell the goods at the price indicated)
and the real question would be whether he was 
entitled
 
to do this. The conceptual method of answering this is
to rephrase the issue in terms of concepts. Instead of asking if the shopkeeper is entitled to refuse to serve a
customer, or to refuse to sell at a marked price, the courts ask whether the shopkeeper has made or accepted an
offer. And this question is answered with little reference to the consequences. One result is that an important
social or moral question is never openly discussed by the courts, namely, should a shopkeeper be allowed to
refuse to serve a member of the public, or should he be allowed to refuse to sell goods at a marked price?
Another result is that the decisions of the courts often rest on demonstratively faulty reasoning. In this
particular area many of the courts’ reasons are shown to be unconvincing by 
other legal decisions dealing with a
situation in which the right to refuse to serve a member of the public is 
denied
, that is, in the case of ‘common
inns’ or hotels … for example … much has been made of the difficulties which a shopkeeper may encounter if he
receives more acceptances than he has goods to sell. If he is deemed to ‘offer’ his goods for sale, is he then to be
liable to all those customers who ‘accept’ his offer even though he cannot supply them? But this is an unreal
difficulty, as is shown by the law relating to hotel-keepers. If a hotel proprietor is asked for a room when he has
no room vacant the courts have had no difficulty in adopting the common sense view that he is not liable.
It will be seen that, if it had been desired to impose liability on a shopkeeper who refused to serve a
customer, the relevant legal concepts would not have stood in the way of achieving this result. The courts could
have said that a shopkeeper ‘impliedly’ offers to do business with any member of the public, and therefore that a
contract is concluded when a customer ‘accepts’ the offer by intimating that he wishes to buy something in the
shop.
Thus in strict logic the way in which a fact or a particular piece of conduct should be conceptualised by
having a legal label attached to it should depend on the result which it is desired to achieve. But it must be
recognized that lawyers and courts often reason in a way which suggests that they do not accept the strictly
logical position. They frequently attach the label first, and give every appearance of thinking that the selection of
the correct label is something which must be done without reference to the result.
In the particular case of self-service shops, legal methods of reasoning probably mean that the law is today
out of touch with modern social conditions, and also with public attitudes. Most people would probably be
surprised to discover that a shopkeeper is not obliged to sell an article at the price indicated if a customer offers
to pay for it, and this public attitude is confirmed by the fact that such behaviour by a shopkeeper would today
probably constitute an offence under … consumer protection legislation.
There is no clear authority on the question whether an advertisement on a website is an
invitation to treat or an offer. A court asked to decide this issue is likely to draw on the
analogy of a display of goods in a shop window or an advertisement in a newspaper. A
good example of this process can be found in the judgment of Rajah JC in the
Singaporean case of 
Chwee Kin Keong
 
v. 
Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd
 
[2004] 2 SLR(R)
594 when he stated (at [93]) that:
[w]ebsite advertisement is in principle no different from a billboard outside a shop or an advertisement in a
newspaper or periodical. The reach of and potential response(s) to such an advertisement are however radically
different. Placing an advertisement on the Internet is essentially advertising or holding out to the world at large.
A viewer from any part of the world may want to enter into a contract to purchase a product as advertised.
Websites often provide a service where online purchases may be made. In effect the Internet conveniently
integrates into a single screen traditional advertising, catalogues, shop displays/windows and physical
shopping.
Two points emerge from this paragraph. The first is that the effect of the analogy drawn
with shop displays and newspaper advertisements is likely to be to create a default rule
to the effect that a website advertisement is an invitation to treat and not an offer. But
there may be a need for caution here. The default rule may be displaced rather more
easily in the context of internet sales than in the context of the display of goods in a shop
window. The range and variety of sales that can take place over the internet may have
the consequence that less 
weight will be placed on a default rule and more on the words
used in the particular advertisement. As Rajah JC observed (at [94]):
As with any normal contract, Internet merchants have to be cautious how they present an advertisement, since
this determines whether the advertisement will be construed as an invitation to treat or a unilateral contract.
Loose language may result in inadvertently establishing contractual liability to a much wider range of
purchasers than resources permit.
This suggests that the possibility of there being an electronic equivalent of 
Carlill
 
or
Lefkowitz
 
is a real one. The second point, which tends in the opposite direction, is that
the potential range of liability may in fact make judges reluctant to conclude that an
advertisement on a website is an offer. On the other hand, a court could mitigate the
possible consequences of such a conclusion by implying into the advertisement a term to
the effect that the offer is only open for acceptance while stocks last. However, such an
implication was rejected by Rajah JC when he stated that ‘the law may not imply a
condition precedent as to the availability of stock simply to bail out an Internet
merchant from a bad bargain’. This statement is open to the objection that the term is
implied not to save the internet merchant from a bad bargain but to give effect to the
intention of the parties, objectively ascertained; that is to say the parties to such an
internet transaction would be presumed to have had the intention that the seller was not
offering to sell a limitless number of goods but was in fact offering to sell its existing
stock only. Rajah JC was on stronger ground when he pointed out that the implied term
may not work in all cases because, in some cases, such as the supply of information, the
supply is potentially limitless. This is true but the response in such a case may be to
place the onus on the seller to insert an appropriate protective clause in order to shield
himself from a huge exposure to liability. As Rajah JC stated (at [96]):
It is therefore incumbent on the web merchant to protect himself, as he has both the means to do so and
knowledge relating to the availability of any product that is being marketed. As most web merchants have
automated software responses, they need to ensure that such automated responses correctly reflect their
intentions from an objective perspective.
3.2.3
 
Tenders
The practice of inviting parties to tender, or to bid, for a particular project is not an
uncommon one. It is, perhaps, most frequently encountered in the context of
construction projects. The employer will generally invite various contractors to tender or
to quote for the work to be done. What is the status of this invitation to tender? Does it
amount to an offer or is it an invitation to negotiate? The answer ultimately depends
upon the facts and circumstances of the individual case. At common law, the general
rule is that the invitation to tender is not an offer but an invitation to negotiate (
Spencer
v. 
Harding
 
(1870) LR 5 CP 561). But, once again, the rule is not an invariable one. Cases
can be found in which the courts have concluded that the invitation to tender did in fact
contain within it an offer (see, for example, 
Blackpool and Fylde Aero Club Ltd
 
v.
Blackpool Borough Council
 
[1990] 1 WLR 1195).
It is important to stress in this context that we are here concerned only with the
common law rules applicable to invitations to tender. The regulation of the tendering
process is not left entirely to the common law. Statute has increasingly intervened to
regulate the tendering 
process, particularly in the context of public bodies, and, while
they are beyond the scope of this book, these regulations assume considerable practical
importance for those subject to them.
BLACKPOOL AND FYLDE AERO CLUB LTD V.
BLACKPOOL BOROUGH COUNCIL
[1990] 1 WLR 1195, Court of Appeal
The appellant council invited tenders for a concession to operate pleasure flights
from the local airport. Among the recipients of this invitation was the respondent
club which in fact had held the concession since 1975. The invitation stated that:
‘The council do not bind themselves to accept all or any part of any tender. No tender which is received
after the last date and time specified shall be admitted for consideration.’
The date and time stipulated was 17 March 1983 at noon. The club submitted its
tender by posting it in the appropriate box on the morning of 17 March. The box
was normally checked and cleared each day at noon but on this occasion it was
not checked until the following day: 18 March. The council at its meeting later in
March refused to consider the club’s tender on the ground that it had been
received late and the concession was awarded to another party. When the council
discovered that the club’s bid had in fact been submitted on time it sought to rectify
the situation by declaring the initial tenders invalid and by re-scheduling the
tendering procedure. But they backed down after being threatened with legal
proceedings by the company whose bid had been accepted. The club then brought
an action for damages against the council. It was held by the trial judge and by the
Court of Appeal that the council was contractually obliged to consider the club’s
tender and, for breach of that obligation, it was held liable in damages.
Bingham LJ
[set out the facts and continued]
The judge resolved the contractual issue in favour of the club, holding that an express request for a
tender might in appropriate circumstances give rise to an implied obligation to perform the service of
considering that tender. Here, the council’s stipulation that tenders received after the deadline would not
be admitted for consideration gave rise to a contractual obligation (on acceptance by submission of a
timely tender) that such tenders would be admitted for consideration.
In attacking the judge’s conclusion on this issue, Mr Toulson [counsel for the appellants] made four
main submissions. First, he submitted that an invitation to tender in this form was well established to be
no more than a proclamation of willingness to receive offers. Even without the first sentence of the
council’s invitation to tender in this case, the council would not have been bound to accept the highest or
any tender. An invitation to tender in this form was an invitation to treat, and no contract of any kind
would come into existence unless or until, if ever, the council chose to accept any tender or other offer.
For these propositions reliance was placed on 
Spencer
 
v. 
Harding
 
(1870) LR 5 CP 561 and 
Harris
 
v.
Nickerson
 
(1873) LR 8 QB 286.
Second, Mr Toulson submitted that on a reasonable reading of this invitation to tender the council
could not be understood to be undertaking to consider all timely tenders submitted. The statement that
late tenders would not be considered did not mean that timely tenders 
would. If the council had meant
that it could have said it. There was, although [counsel] did not put it in these words, no maxim exclusio
unius, expressio alterius.
Third, the court should be no less rigorous when asked to imply a contract than when asked to imply
a term in an existing contract or to find a collateral contract. A term would not be implied simply because
it was reasonable to do so: 
Liverpool City Council
 
v. 
Irwin
 
[1977] AC 239, 253H. In order to establish
collateral contracts, ‘Not only the terms of such contracts but the existence of an animus contrahendi
 
on
the part of all the parties to them must be clearly shewn’: see 
Heilbut Symons & Co
 
v. 
Buckleton
 
[1913]
AC 30, 47. No lower standard was applicable here and the standard was not satisfied.
Fourth, Mr Toulson submitted that the warranty contended for by the club was simply a proposition
‘tailor-made to produce the desired result’ (per Lord Templeman in 
CBS Songs Ltd
 
v. 
Amstrad Consumer
Electronics plc
 
[1988] AC 1013, 1059F) on the facts of this particular case. There was a vital distinction
between expectations, however reasonable, and contractual obligations: see per Diplock LJ in 
Lavarack
3
4
v. 
Woods of Colchester Ltd
 
[1967] 1 QB 278, 294. The club here expected its tender to be considered.
The council fully intended that it should be. It was in both parties’ interests that the club’s tender should
be considered. There was thus no need for them to contract. The court should not subvert well-
understood contractual principles by adopting a woolly pragmatic solution designed to remedy a
perceived injustice on the unique facts of this particular case.
In defending the judge’s decision Mr Shorrock [counsel for the club] accepted that an invitation to
tender was normally no more than an offer to receive tenders. But it could, he submitted, in certain
circumstances give rise to binding contractual obligations on the part of the invitor, either from the
express words of the tender or from the circumstances surrounding the sending out of the invitation to
tender or (as here) from both. The circumstances relied on here were that the council approached the
club and the other invitees, all of them connected with the airport, that the club had held the concession
for eight years, having successfully tendered on three previous occasions, that the council as a local
authority was obliged to comply with its standing orders and owed a fiduciary duty to ratepayers to act
with reasonable prudence in managing its financial affairs and that there was a clear intention on the part
of both parties that all timely tenders would be considered. If in these circumstances one asked of this
invitation to tender the question posed by Bowen LJ in 
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic Smoke Ball Co
 
[1893] 1 QB
256, 266, ‘How would an ordinary person reading this document construe it?’, the answer in Mr
Shorrock’s submission was clear: the council might or might not accept any particular tender; it might
accept no tender; it might decide not to award the concession at all; it would not consider any tender
received after the advertised deadline; but if it did consider any tender received before the deadline and
conforming with the advertised conditions it would consider all such tenders.
I found great force in the submissions made by Mr Toulson and agree with much of what was said.
Indeed, for much of the hearing I was of opinion that the judge’s decision, although fully in accord with
the merits as I see them, could not be sustained in principle. But I am in the end persuaded that [the]
argument proves too much. During the hearing the following questions were raised: what if, in a situation
such as the present, the council had opened and thereupon accepted the first tender received, even
though the deadline had not expired and other invitees had not yet responded? or if the council had
considered and accepted a tender admittedly received well after the deadline? Mr Toulson answered that
although by so acting 
the council might breach its own standing orders, and might fairly be accused of
discreditable conduct, it would not be in breach of any legal obligation because at that stage there would
be none to breach. This is a conclusion I cannot accept, and if it were accepted there would in my view
be an unacceptable discrepancy between the law of contract and the confident assumptions of
commercial parties, both tenderers … and invitors (as reflected in the immediate reaction of the council
when the mishap came to light).
A tendering procedure of this kind is, in many respects, heavily weighted in favour of the invitor. He
can invite tenders from as many or as few parties as he chooses. He need not tell any of them who else,
or how many others, he has invited. The invitee may often, although not here, be put to considerable
labour and expense in preparing a tender, ordinarily without recompense if he is unsuccessful. The
invitation to tender may itself, in a complex case, although again not here, involve time and expense to
prepare, but the invitor does not commit himself to proceed with the project, whatever it is; he need not
accept the highest tender; he need not accept any tender; he need not give reasons to justify his
acceptance or rejection of any tender received. The risk to which the tenderer is exposed does not end
with the risk that his tender may not be the highest (or, as the case may be, lowest). But where, as here,
tenders are solicited from selected parties all of them known to the invitor, and where a local authority’s
invitation prescribes a clear, orderly and familiar procedure (draft contract conditions available for
inspection and plainly not open to negotiation, a prescribed common form of tender, the supply of
envelopes designed to preserve the absolute anonymity of tenderers and clearly to identify the tender in
question and an absolute deadline) the invitee is in my judgment protected at least to this extent: if he
submits a conforming tender before the deadline he is entitled, not as a matter of mere expectation but
of contractual right, to be sure that his tender will after the deadline be opened and considered in
conjunction with all other conforming tenders or at least that his tender will be considered if others are.
Had the club, before tendering, inquired of the council whether it could rely on any timely and conforming
tender being considered along with others, I feel quite sure that the answer would have been ‘of course’.
The law would, I think, be defective if it did not give effect to that.
It is of course true that the invitation to tender does not explicitly state that the council will consider
timely and conforming tenders. That is why one is concerned with implication. But the council does not
either say that it does not bind itself to do so, and in the context a reasonable invitee would understand
the invitation to be saying, quite clearly, that if he submitted a timely and conforming tender it would be
considered, at least if any other such tender were considered.
I readily accept that contracts are not to be lightly implied. Having examined what the parties said
and did, the court must be able to conclude with confidence both that the parties intended to create
contractual relations and that the agreement was to the effect contended for. It must also, in most cases,
be able to answer the question posed by Mustill LJ in 
Hispanica de Petroleos SA
 
v. 
Vencedora Oceanica
Navegacion SA (No 2) (Note)
 
[1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 321, 331: ‘What was the mechanism for offer and
acceptance?’ In all the circumstances of this case (and I say nothing about any other) I have no doubt
that the parties did intend to create contractual relations to the limited extent contended for. Since it has
never been the law that a person is only entitled to enforce his contractual rights in a reasonable way
(
White and Carter (Councils) Ltd
 
v. 
McGregor
 
[1962] AC 413, 430A per Lord Reid), Mr Shorrock was in
my view right to contend for no more than a contractual duty to consider. I think it plain that the council’s
invitation to tender was, to this limited extent, an offer, and the club’s submission of a timely and
conforming tender an acceptance.
Mr Toulson’s fourth submission is a salutary warning, but it is not a free-standing argument: if, as I
hold, his first three submissions are to be rejected, no subversion of principle is 
involved. I am, however,
pleased that what seems to me the right legal answer also accords with the merits as I see them.
I accordingly agree with the judge’s conclusion on the contractual issue, essentially for the reasons
which he more briefly gave.

Commentary
Given the general rule that an invitation to tender is an invitation to negotiate and not
an offer, it is important to identify the factors upon which the Court of Appeal relied in
concluding that this particular invitation to tender amounted to an offer to consider
tenders submitted on time. The task of identifying these factors is not, however, an easy
one. The court relied upon a number of factors and it would appear that it was their
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
combination that was important. No one factor was decisive. The factors considered by
the court included the following:
the invitation to tender was addressed to a small number of interested parties;
the tender procedure was ‘clear, orderly and familiar’; and
the outcome was, in the opinion of the court, consistent with the ‘assumptions of
commercial parties’.
Other factors which may have been of significance include:
the club was the holder of the concession and therefore might be said to have had
a legitimate expectation of consideration for renewal; and
the fact that the invitation was issued by a local authority which, it was argued,
owed a ‘fiduciary duty to ratepayers to act with reasonable prudence in managing
its financial affairs’.
The invitation to tender did not state expressly that the council was subject to a duty to
consider all tenders submitted. Indeed, the first sentence of the invitation to tender
stated that the council did not bind itself to accept all or any part of any tender. But the
fact that the council excluded a duty to accept any tender was held to be insufficient to
exclude the duty to consider tenders made. Presumably the council should have gone
further and excluded not only a duty to accept a tender but also the duty to consider any
tender submitted.
It was not necessary for the Court of Appeal to analyse in any detail the extent of the
obligation to consider tenders submitted on time given that the council had not, on the
facts, given any consideration to the tender submitted by the club. What would have
been the position if the council had considered the tender and rejected it but awarded
the tender to a party whose bid was lower than that submitted by the club? Stocker LJ
stated that the obligation to consider ‘would not preclude or inhibit the council from
deciding not to accept any tender or to award the concession, provided the decision was
bona fide and honest, to any tenderer’. Thus a bona fide decision to exclude a party from
the bidding process (for example, because of a conflict of interest between one of the
tenderers and an employee of the party issuing the invitation to tender) may not
constitute a breach of the duty to consider tenders submitted on time (see 
Fairclough
Building Ltd
 
v. 
Borough Council of Port Talbot
 
(1993) 62 Build LR 82). This duty to
consider is not as onerous as a duty to act judicially. Thus the duty 
to consider tenders
does not require the party inviting the tenders to give a hearing to parties who submit a
tender (see 
Pratt Contractors Ltd
 
v. 
Transit New Zealand
 
[2003] UKPC 33).
The Court of Appeal was not asked to consider the measure of damages to which the
club was entitled. On the facts, the tender submitted by the club was larger than the one
accepted by the council. Notwithstanding this fact it is suggested that the loss to the club
was not in fact the loss of the contract (because we cannot be sure that the club would
have been awarded the concession) but the ‘loss of a chance’ to participate in the
tendering process and to have its tender considered (on damages for loss of a chance see
Chaplin
 
v. 
Hicks
 
[1911] 2 KB 786 at 
23.4
).
The proposition that an invitation to tender followed by the submission of a tender can
result in the creation of a contract between the party inviting the bid and the party
making the bid has implications for both parties. In 
The Queen in Right of Ontario
 
v.
Ron Engineering & Construction Eastern Ltd
 
(1981) 119 DLR (3d) 267 a bidder
discovered shortly after the bids had been opened that it had made a mistake in
formulating its bid. It sought to withdraw from the process and recover the deposit
which it had paid to the party inviting the bids. The basis on which the deposit had been
paid was that it would be forfeited if the tender was withdrawn or the tenderer refused
to proceed with the contract. The Supreme Court of Canada held that the plaintiffs were
not entitled to recover their deposit. A contract had been created by the parties, one of
the terms of which was that bidders were not entitled to recover their deposit if they
refused to proceed with the contract.
A further example of a case in which an invitation to tender was held to contain within it
an offer is the decision of the House of Lords in 
Harvela Investments Ltd
 
v. 
Royal Trust
Company of Canada (CI) Ltd
 
[1986] AC 207. The first defendants owned a block of
shares in a company. The plaintiff (Harvela) and the second defendant (Sir Leonard
Outerbridge) were rival bidders for the shares. The reason for their interest in the shares
was that ownership of them would give to the successful bidder effective control of the
company. The first defendants sent out an invitation to both Harvela and Sir Leonard in
which they invited both parties to submit ‘any revised offer which you may wish by
sealed tender or confidential telex’ to the first defendants’ solicitors. The first defendants
in turn stated: ‘we confirm that if any offer made by you is the highest offer received by
us we bind ourselves to accept such offer provided that such offer complies with the
terms of this telex.’ Harvela submitted a bid of $2,175,000, while Sir Leonard submitted
a bid of $2,100,000 ‘or [Canadian] $101,000 in excess of any other offer which you may
receive which is expressed as a fixed monetary amount, whichever is the higher’. The
first defendants accepted Sir Leonard’s offer, treating it as a bid of $2,276,000, and
entered into a contract with the second defendant for the sale of the shares. Harvela
issued proceedings against both the first defendants and Sir Leonard in which, among
other things, it challenged the validity of Sir Leonard’s bid. The House of Lords held that
Sir Leonard’s bid was indeed invalid and that the first defendant was contractually
bound to transfer the shares to Harvela in accordance with the terms of its bid.
It is one thing to describe the outcome of the litigation; it is quite another to explain the
reasoning that led to this conclusion. At first sight Sir Leonard appeared to have a strong
argument, namely that he was invited to make a ‘revised offer’ for the shares, he made
one, and the first defendants accepted it. Therefore, a contract had been validly
concluded for the sale to him of the shares. Lord Templeman (at p. 230) in the House of
Lords rejected this submission on the ground that the invitation to bid sent out by the
first defendants contained provisions ‘which are only consistent with the presumed
intention to create a fixed bidding sale and which are inconsistent with any presumed
intention to create an auction sale by means of referential bids’ (a referential bid being a
bid which is 
not of a fixed amount but one made by reference to another bid). He held
that, as a matter of construction, the invitation issued by the first defendants created a
fixed bidding sale. Thus he concluded (at p. 233):
The invitation required Sir Leonard to name his price and required Harvela to name its price and bound the
vendors to accept the higher price. The invitation was not difficult to understand and the result was bound to be
certain and to accord with the presumed intentions of the vendors discernible from the express provisions of the
invitation. Harvela named the price of $2,175,000; Sir Leonard failed to name any price except $2,100,000
which was less than the price named by Harvela. The vendors were bound to accept Harvela’s offer.
But on what basis could it be said that the vendors were bound to accept Harvela’s offer
given that the general rule is that an offeree is free to decide whether or not to accept an
offer? Lord Diplock used the following analysis. In his view (at p. 224), the legal nature
of the invitation sent out by the first defendants was that of:
a unilateral or ‘if’ contract, or rather of two unilateral contracts in identical terms to one of which the vendors
and Harvela were the parties as promisor and promisee respectively, while to the other the vendors were
promisor and Sir Leonard was promisee. Such unilateral contracts were made at the time when the invitation
was received by the promisee to whom it was addressed by the vendors; under neither of them did the
promisee, Harvela and Sir Leonard respectively, assume any legal obligation to anyone to do or refrain from
doing anything.
The first defendants did, however, assume a legal obligation to Harvela and Sir Leonard
under these two contracts. They assumed an obligation to enter into a contract to sell
shares to the promisee who submitted the highest bid in accordance with the terms of
the invitation. In this way the unilateral contract concluded with the successful bidder
would be transformed into a binding bilateral contract, while the unilateral contract
with the unsuccessful bidder would be terminated by the submission of the higher bid.
This analysis, involving as it does two unilateral contracts, one of which is transformed
into a bilateral contract and the other of which is terminated, is complex, possibly too
complex. A simpler analysis might have been to conclude that the invitation was an offer
of a unilateral contract. The point has been made in the following way (R Brownsword,
Smith and Thomas: A Casebook on Contract
 
(14th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021), para
2-015):
The Royal Trust’s telex to Harvela and Sir Leonard was an offer to each of them which could be accepted only by
one—the one who made the higher valid bid. The telex was an offer of a unilateral contract, like an offer to give a
prize to the one of two entrants for a race who comes first. The ‘prize’ was a contract for the sale of the shares—
the Trust was bound to accept the higher bidder’s offer to buy them.
Until that bid was made, no one was under any obligation. The Trust could have withdrawn its offer and the
two offerees were under no obligation to bid. While the offer stood, the Trust was, of course, liable to become
bound to one of the offerees through the acceptance of its offer, but that is the position of all offerors, so long as
their offer remains open to acceptance. 
When the higher bid was ascertained, the Trust was bound to accept it.
At that moment there was just one contract—a contract by the Trust to accept the higher bidder’s offer—a
unilateral contract. The bidder was free to withdraw his bid until the Trust accepted it, but when they did he
became bound to buy the shares.

Auction Sales
One battleground for the formulation of the rules relating to offer and acceptance has
been the auction-house. Many of the cases were decided in the nineteenth century but
uncertainty in relation to the rules applicable to an auction without reserve (that is to
say an auction where no reserve price is stated for the lot that has been put up for sale)
persisted until recently. The legal position is much more straightforward in the case of
auctions held with a reserve price. The auctioneer, in inviting bids to be made for the lot
offered for sale, makes an invitation to negotiate. The offer is then made by the member
of the public who makes a bid for the lot. That bid is not usually accepted immediately.
Instead the auctioneer generally invites further bids to be made for the lot. If no other
bids are forthcoming the auctioneer will accept the bid on the fall of his hammer (see,
for example, 
British Car Auctions
 
v. 
Wright
 
[1972] 1 WLR 1519). It is the case of the
auction without a reserve price that has given rise to difficulty. There were dicta in a
nineteenth-century case, 
Warlow
 
v. 
Harrison
 
(1859) 1 E & B 309, to the effect that, in
the case of an auction held without a reserve price, the auctioneer makes an offer to sell
the goods and that the offer is accepted by the person who makes the highest bid at the
auction. The difficulty lay in accommodating this analysis within the offer and
acceptance framework and a considerable amount of academic ink was spilt on the
topic. However, the issue came before the Court of Appeal in the following case:
BARRY V. DAVIES (TRADING AS HEATHCOTE BALL &
CO)
[2000] 1 WLR 1962, Court of Appeal
Customs and Excise put up two engine analysers for sale by auction, without a
reserve price. The price of new machines was £14,521 each. The claimant bid
£200 for each machine after the auctioneer tried and failed to get bids of £5,000
and £3,000 for each machine. The auctioneer refused to sell the machines to the
claimant for such a low price and they were later sold to a third party for £1,500
each. The claimant brought an action against the auctioneer for breach of contract.
The claim succeeded on the ground that there was a collateral contract between
the auctioneer and the highest bidder. The contract was constituted by an offer by
the auctioneer to sell to the highest bidder and it was accepted when the bid was
made. The claimant was held to be entitled to recover £27,600 by way of
damages, being the difference between the amount that the claimant had bid to
purchase the machines and the amount he would have been required to pay to
obtain the machines in the ordinary way.
Sir Murray Stuart-Smith
[set out the facts and continued]
The judge held that it would be the general and reasonable expectation of persons attending at an
auction sale without reserve that the highest bidder would and should be entitled to 
the lot for which he
bids. Such an outcome was in his view fair and logical. As a matter of law he held that there was a
collateral contract between the auctioneer and the highest bidder constituted by an offer by the
auctioneer to sell to the highest bidder which was accepted when the bid was made. In so doing he
followed the views of the majority of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 
Warlow
 
v. 
Harrison
 
(1859) 1 E &
E 309.
‘(3)
(4)
He also held that this was the effect of condition 1 of the conditions of sale, which was in these terms:
‘The highest bidder to be the purchaser; but should any dispute arise between two or more bidders
the same shall be determined by the auctioneers who shall have the right of withdrawing lots.’
The judge concluded that the first clause meant what it said and the right of withdrawal was conditioned
on there being a dispute between bidders, and there was none.
Mr Moran on behalf of the defendant criticised this conclusion on a number of grounds. First, he
submitted that the holding of an auction without reserve does not amount to a promise on the part of the
auctioneer to sell the lots to the highest bidder. There are no express words to the effect, merely a
statement of fact that the vendor has not placed a reserve on the lot. Such an intention, he submitted, is
inconsistent with two principles of law, namely that the auctioneer’s request for bids is not an offer which
can be accepted by the highest bidder (
Payne
 
v. 
Cave
 
(1789) 3 Durn & E 148) and that there is no
completed contract of sale until the auctioneer’s hammer falls and the bidder may withdraw his bid up
until that time (Sale of Goods Act 1979, section 57(2), which reflects the common law). There should be
no need to imply such a promise into a statement that the sale is without reserve, because there may be
other valid reasons why the auctioneer should be entitled to withdraw the lot, for example if he
suspected an illegal ring or that the vendor had no title to sell.
Secondly, Mr Moran submitted that there is no consideration for the auctioneer’s promise. He
submitted that the bid itself cannot amount to consideration because the bidder has not promised to do
anything, he can withdraw the bid until it is accepted and the sale completed by the fall of the hammer.
At most the bid represents a discretionary promise, which amounts to illusory consideration, for example
promising to do something ‘if I feel like it’. The bid only had real benefit to the auctioneer at the moment
the sale is completed by the fall of the hammer. Furthermore, the suggestion that consideration is
provided because the auctioneer has the opportunity to accept the bid or to obtain a higher bid as the
bidding is driven up depends upon the bid not being withdrawn.
Finally, Mr Moran submitted that where an agent is acting for a disclosed principal he is not liable on
the contract: 
Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency
, 16th ed (1996), p. 548, para 9–001 and 
Mainprice
 
v.
Westley
 
(1865) 6 B & S 420. If therefore there is any collateral contract it is with the principal and not the
agent.
These submissions were forcefully and attractively argued by Mr Moran. The authorities, such as
they were, do not speak with one voice. The starting point is section 57 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979,
which re-enacted the Sale of Goods Act 1893 (56 & 57 Vict. c. 71), itself in this section a codification of
the common law. I have already referred to the effect of subsection (2). Subsections (3) and (4) are also
important. They provide:
A sale by auction may be notified to be subject to a reserve or upset price, and a right to
bid may also be reserved expressly by or on behalf of the seller.
Where a sale by auction is not notified to be subject to the right to bid by or on behalf of the
seller, it is not lawful for the seller to bid himself or to employ any person to bid at the sale,
or for the auctioneer knowingly to take any bid from the seller or any such person.’
Although the Act does not expressly deal with sales by auction without reserve, the auctioneer is the
agent of the vendor and, unless subsection (4) has been complied with, it is not lawful for him to make a
bid. Yet withdrawing the lot from the sale because it has not reached the level which the auctioneer
considers appropriate is tantamount to bidding on behalf of the seller. The highest bid cannot be rejected
simply because it is not high enough.
The judge based his decision on the reasoning of the majority of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in
Warlow
 
v. 
Harrison
, 1 E & E 309. The sale was of ‘the three following horses, the property of a
gentleman, without reserve’: see p. 314. The plaintiff bid 60 guineas for one of the horses; another
person, who was in fact the owner, immediately bid 61 guineas. The plaintiff, having been informed that
the bid was from the owner declined to bid higher, and claimed he was entitled to the horse. He sued the
auctioneer; he based his claim on a plea that the auctioneer was his agent to complete the contract on
his behalf. On that plea the plaintiff succeeded at first instance; but the verdict was set aside in the Court
of Queen’s Bench. The plaintiff appealed. Although the Court of Exchequer Chamber upheld the decision
on the case as pleaded, all five members of the court held that if the pleadings were appropriately
amended, the plaintiff would be entitled to succeed on a retrial. Martin B gave the judgment of the
majority, consisting of himself, Byles and Watson BB. He said, at pp. 316–317:
‘Upon the facts of the case, it seems to us that the plaintiff is entitled to recover. In a sale by
auction there are three parties, viz the owner of the property to be sold, the auctioneer, and the
portion of the public who attend to bid, which of course includes the highest bidder. In this, as in
most cases of sales by auction, the owner’s name was not disclosed: he was a concealed
principal. The name of the auctioneers, of whom the defendant was one, alone was published; and
the sale was announced by them to be “without reserve”. This, according to all the cases both at
law and equity, means that neither the vendor nor any person in his behalf shall bid at the auction,
and that the property shall be sold to the highest bidder, whether the sum bid be equivalent to the
real value or not; 
Thornett
 
v. 
Haines
 
(1846) 15 M & W 367. We cannot distinguish the case of an
auctioneer putting up property for sale upon such a condition from the case of the loser of property
offering a reward, or that of a railway company publishing a timetable stating the times when, and
the places to which, the trains run. It has been decided that the person giving the information
advertised for, or a passenger taking a ticket, may sue as upon a contract with him; 
Denton
 
v.
Great Northern Railway Co
 
(1856) 5 E & B 860. Upon the same principle, it seems to us that the
highest bona fide bidder at an auction may sue the auctioneer as upon a contract that the sale
shall be without reserve. We think the auctioneer who puts the property up for sale upon such a
condition pledges himself that the sale shall be without reserve; or, in other words, contracts that it
shall be so; and that this contract is made with the highest bona fide bidder; and, in case of breach
of it, that he has a right of action against the auctioneer. … We entertain no doubt that the owner
may, at any time before the contract is legally complete, interfere and revoke the auctioneer’s
authority: but he does so at his peril; and, if the auctioneer has contracted any liability in
consequence of his employment and the subsequent revocation or conduct of the owner, he is
entitled to be indemnified.’
The two other members of the court, Willes J and Bramwell B reached the same conclusion, but based
their decision on breach of warranty of authority.
Although therefore the decision of the majority is not strictly binding, it was the reasoned judgment of
the majority and is entitled to very great respect. …
In 
Harris
 
v. 
Nickerson
 
(1873) LR 8 QB 286 the defendant, an auctioneer, advertised a sale by auction
of certain lots including office furniture on a certain day and the two following days. But the sale of
furniture on the third day was withdrawn. The plaintiff attended the sale 
and claimed against the
defendant for breach of contract in not holding the sale, seeking to recover his expenses in attending.
The claim was rejected by the Court of Queen’s Bench. In the course of his judgment Blackburn J said,
at p. 288:
‘in the case of 
Warlow
 
v. 
Harrison
 
1 E & E 309, 314, 318, the opinion of the majority of the judges
in the Exchequer Chamber appears to have been that an action would lie for not knocking down
the lot to the highest bona fide bidder when the sale was advertised as without reserve; in such a
case it may be that there is a contract to sell to the highest bidder, and that if the owner bids there
is a breach of the contract.’
And Quain J said, LR 8 QB 286, 289:
‘When a sale is advertised as without reserve, and a lot is put up and bid for, there is ground for
saying, as was said in 
Warlow
 
v. 
Harrison
, E & E 309, 314, that a contract is entered into between
the auctioneer and the highest bona fide bidder … ’
In 
Johnston
 
v. 
Boyes
 
[1899] 2 Ch 73, 77 Cozens-Hardy J also accepted the majority view in 
Warlow’s
case as being good law …
So far as textbook writers are concerned both 
Chitty on Contracts
, 28th edn (1999), vol 1, p. 94, para
2–010 and 
Benjamin’s Sale of Goods
, 5th edn (1997), p. 107, para 2–005 adopt the view expressed by
the majority of the court in 
Warlow’s
 
case.
As to consideration, in my judgment there is consideration both in the form of detriment to the bidder,
since his bid can be accepted unless and until it is withdrawn, and benefit to the auctioneer as the
bidding is driven up. Moreover, attendance at the sale is likely to be increased if it is known that there is
no reserve.
As to the agency point, there is no doubt that, when the sale is concluded, the contract is between
the purchaser and vendor and not the auctioneer. Even if the identity of the vendor is not disclosed, it is
clear that the auctioneer is selling as agent. It is true that there was no such contract between vendor
and purchaser. But that does not prevent a collateral agreement existing between the auctioneer and
bidder. A common example of this is an action for breach of warranty of authority which arises on a
collateral contract.
For these reasons I would uphold the judge’s decision on liability.
Pill LJ
 
delivered a concurring judgment.
Commentary
The contract found to exist on the facts of 
Barry
 
was one between the potential buyer
and the auctioneer. It was not a contract of sale between the seller and the buyer. The
effect of the auctioneer’s action was to prevent a contract coming into being between the
seller and the buyer.
At what point in time does the auctioneer make the offer to sell the goods? Is it when the
auction is advertised without a reserve price or is it when the auctioneer puts the goods
up for sale at the auction? It was not necessary for the Court of Appeal to answer this
question on the facts of 
Barry
. Academic authority is divided on this issue. Support can
be found for the proposition that the offer is made when the auction is advertised (see
Gower (1952) 68 
LQR
 
238, 241) and for the proposition that the offer is made when the
auctioneer puts the goods up for sale (Scott [2001] 
LMCLQ
 
334, 335).
On the facts of 
Barry
 
it would appear that there were no other bidders for the lots so
that the identification of the claimant as the highest bidder was not problematic. But in
other cases the issue may give rise to difficulty, given that there is always the possibility
that another bidder will emerge before the auctioneer finally brings down his hammer.
The courts will probably take a pragmatic approach to the resolution of this issue and
equate the highest bidder with the party who made the last bid before the lot was
withdrawn by the auctioneer.
While an auctioneer can generally withdraw a lot from the auction where the item has
been put up for sale subject to a reserve price, it has been argued that the auctioneer can
no longer do so once the reserve price has been reached (see Scott [2001] 
LMCLQ
 
334,
336–337). In other words, it is argued that the position of a bidder at an auction without
a reserve price is in this respect the same as a bidder at an auction with a reserve price,
where that price has already been reached. This is so unless the owner has reserved for
himself the right to bid for the lot in question.
While an auctioneer cannot withdraw the lot simply because it has not reached the
reserve price, he may be able to do so where he suspects that the bidder is not bona fide,
in the sense that he is a participant in a group that is attempting to depress the price of
the lot.
The analysis of the process by which the offer and the acceptance was made cannot be
cleanly separated from the issue of whether or not there is consideration for the
promise. One of the difficulties in 
Barry
 
lay in identifying the consideration for the
auctioneer’s promise to sell the lot to the highest bidder. The answer given by the court
was that the consideration was to be found in the fact that the auctioneer obtains the
benefit of the fact that the price for the lot might be driven up and the bidder might be
bound by the bid he makes. The difficulty with this view is that the bid made is a
revocable one and this provides an insecure foundation for the finding of consideration
for the promise.
One final issue that arose on the facts of the case concerned the claimant’s entitlement
to damages. It was held that the claimant was entitled to recover £27,600 by way of
damages, being the difference between the amount that the claimant had bid to
purchase the machines and the amount he would have been required to pay to obtain
the machines in the ordinary way. It should be noted that the claim was for the entire
difference between the two measures and not simply for the loss of a chance of
purchasing the machines and that, perhaps rather oddly (given that the contract
between the auctioneer and the claimant was not a contract for the sale of goods), the
court relied on section 51(3) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 when assessing the damages
to which the claimant was entitled.
 
The inclusion of the one is the exclusion of the other.

What Constitutes an Acceptance?
An acceptance has been defined as ‘a final and unqualified expression of assent, whether
by words or conduct, to the terms of an offer’ (H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on Contracts
 
(34th
edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021), para 4-031). This definition appears straightforward. But
initial appearances can be misleading. The question whether an offer has been accepted
has generated a considerable amount of case-law. Questions that have been asked of the
courts include the following:
must the acceptance coincide exactly with the terms of the offer?
must the acceptance be communicated to the offeror in all cases?
where an offeror prescribes a particular method of acceptance, can the offer only
be accepted by the prescribed method?
can silence ever constitute an acceptance of an offer?
when does an acceptance sent through the post take effect?
how and when does acceptance take place in the case of a unilateral contract?
and
can a party accept an offer if he was unaware of the offer at the time at which he
performed the act which constitutes the acceptance?
Thus the law in this area consists of a number of detailed rules. That said, there appear
to be two central principles. The first is that the acceptance must be both final and
unqualified and the second is that it must generally be communicated to the offeror. We
shall consider these central principles together with the more detailed rules of law in the
remainder of this section.
3.3.1
 
Must the Acceptance Coincide Exactly with
the Terms of the Offer?
The general answer is that an acceptance must be an ‘unqualified expression of assent’
to the terms proposed by the offeror. Thus a purported acceptance which attempts to
vary the terms contained in an offer is not an acceptance at all. In fact, it will be
interpreted by the court as a rejection of the offer and as a fresh offer (or a ‘counter-
offer’) which is then open for acceptance or rejection by the original offeror. Thus in
Hyde
 
v. 
Wrench
 
(1840) 3 Beav 334 the defendant offered to sell his farm to the plaintiff
for £1,000. The plaintiff offered to buy it for £950 but the defendant refused to do so.
The plaintiff then wrote to the defendant and agreed to pay £1,000 for the farm but the
defendant never replied to that letter. It was held that no contract had been concluded
for the sale of the farm. Lord Langdale stated (at p. 337):
I think there exists no valid binding contract between the parties for the purchase of the property. The
Defendant offered to sell it for £1,000, and if that had been at once unconditionally accepted, there would
undoubtedly have been a perfect binding contract; instead of that, the Plaintiff made an offer of his own, to
purchase the property for £950, and he thereby rejected the offer previously made by the Defendant. I think
that it was not afterwards competent for him to revive the proposal of the Defendant, by tendering an
acceptance of it; and that, therefore, there exists no obligation of any sort between the parties.
It is, however, important to consider the correspondence between the parties with some
care because what appears at first sight to be a counter-offer, and hence a rejection, may
turn out on closer inspection to be a mere inquiry or request for information. Such was
the case in 
Stevenson, Jacques & Co
 
v. 
McLean
 
(1880) 5 QBD 346. The defendants
wrote to the plaintiffs stating that they were willing to sell iron to the plaintiffs and
stated that the offer was open for a period of time. On the last day of that period the
plaintiffs telegraphed to the defendant: ‘Please wire whether you would accept forty for
delivery over two months, or if not, longest limit you would give.’ Later that day the
defendants sold the iron to a third party and they sent a telegram to the plaintiffs to
inform them of this. Before they received the telegram from the defendants the plaintiffs
found a buyer for the iron and sent a telegram to the defendants in which they accepted
the defendants’ offer to sell the iron. The defendants refused to deliver the iron to the
plaintiffs and so the plaintiffs sued for non-delivery. One of the grounds on which the
defendants sought to deny liability was that the plaintiffs’ first telegram was a rejection
of the defendants’ offer so that their offer 
was no longer open for acceptance when the
plaintiffs purported to accept it later in the day. Lush J rejected the defendants’
argument and their reliance upon 
Hyde
 
v. 
Wrench
. He concluded (at p. 350):
[T]he form of the telegram is one of inquiry. It is not ‘I offer forty for delivery over two months,’ which would
have likened the case to 
Hyde
 
v. 
Wrench
. … Here there is no counter-proposal. The words are ‘Please wire
whether you would accept forty for delivery over two months, or if not, longest limit you would give’. There is
nothing specific by way of offer or rejection, but a mere inquiry, which should have been answered and not
treated as a rejection of the offer. This ground of objection therefore fails.
The defendants’ attempted revocation of their offer was held to be ineffective because
the plaintiffs had accepted the offer prior to the revocation being brought to their
attention. The plaintiffs were therefore entitled to recover damages for the non-delivery
of the iron.
A rigid insistence on a precise correspondence between the terms of the offer and the
terms of the acceptance gives rise to difficulty in modern trading conditions, where
businesses frequently make use of their own standard terms and conditions of business.
These standard terms frequently differ in major or minor respects. Do these differences
prevent the conclusion of a contract in most business contracts? The leading case on this
issue is:
BUTLER MACHINE TOOL CO LTD V. EX-CELL-O
CORPORATION (ENGLAND) LTD
[1979] 1 WLR 401, Court of Appeal
The facts of the case are set out in the judgments below.
Lord Denning MR
This case is a ‘battle of forms’. The plaintiffs, the Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd, suppliers of a machine, on
May 23, 1969, quoted a price for a machine tool of £75,535. Delivery was to be given in 10 months. On
the back of the quotation there were terms and conditions. One of them was a price variation clause. It
provided for an increase in the price if there was an increase in the costs and so forth. The machine tool
was not delivered until November 1970. By that time costs had increased so much that the sellers
claimed an additional sum of £2,892 as due to them under the price variation clause.
The defendant buyers, Ex-Cell-O Corporation (England) Ltd, rejected the excess charge. They relied
on their own terms and conditions. They said:
‘We did not accept the sellers’ quotation as it was. We gave an order for the self-same machine at
the self-same price, but on the back of our order we had our own terms and conditions. Our terms
and conditions did not contain any price variation clause.’
The judge held that the price variation clause in the sellers’ form continued through the whole dealing
and so the sellers were entitled to rely upon it. He was clearly influenced by a passage in 
Anson’s Law of
Contract
, 24th edn (1975), pp. 37 and 38, of which the editor is Professor Guest: and also by Treitel, 
The
Law of Contract
, 4th edn (1975), p. 15. The judge said that the sellers did all that was necessary and
reasonable to bring the price variation clause to the notice of the buyers. He thought that the buyers
would not ‘browse over the 
conditions’ of the sellers: and then, by printed words in their (the buyers’)
document, trap the sellers into a fixed price contract.
I am afraid that I cannot agree with the suggestion that the buyers ‘trapped’ the sellers in any way.
Neither party called any oral evidence before the judge. The case was decided on the documents alone.
I propose therefore to go through them.
On May 23, 1969, the sellers offered to deliver one ‘Butler’ double column plane-miller for the total
price of £75,535. Delivery 10 months (subject to confirmation at time of ordering) other terms and
conditions are on the reverse of this quotation. On the back there were 16 conditions in small print
starting with this general condition:
‘All orders are accepted only upon and subject to the terms set out in our quotation and the
following conditions. These terms and conditions shall prevail over any terms and conditions in the
buyer’s order.’
Clause 3 was the price variation clause. It said:
‘Prices are based on present day costs of manufacture and design and having regard to the
delivery quoted and uncertainty as to the cost of labour, materials etc. during the period of
manufacture, we regret that we have no alternative but to make it a condition of acceptance of
order that goods will be charged at prices ruling upon date of delivery.’
The buyers replied on May 27, 1969, giving an order in these words: ‘Please supply on terms and
conditions as below and overleaf’. Below there was a list of the goods ordered, but there were
differences from the quotation of the sellers in these respects: (i) there was an additional item for the
cost of installation, £3,100 and (ii) there was a different delivery date: instead of 10 months, it was 10–11
months.
Overleaf there were different terms as to the cost of carriage: in that it was to be paid to the delivery
address of the buyers: whereas the sellers’ terms were ex warehouse. There were different terms as to
the right to cancel for late delivery. The buyers in their conditions reserved the right to cancel if delivery
was not made by the agreed date, whereas the sellers in their conditions said that cancellation of order
due to late delivery would not be accepted.
On the foot of the buyers’ order there was a tear-off slip headed:
‘Acknowledgment: Please sign and return to Ex-Cell-O. We accept your order on the terms and
conditions stated thereon—and undertake to deliver by—Date—signed.’
In that slip the delivery date and signature were left blank ready to be filled in by the sellers. On June 5,
1969, the sellers wrote this letter to the buyers:
‘We have pleasure in acknowledging receipt of your official order dated May 27 covering the
supply of one Butler Double Column Plane-Miller. This being delivered in accordance with our
revised quotation of May 23 for delivery in 10/11 months, i.e., March/April 1970. We return
herewith duly completed your acknowledgment of order form.’
They enclosed the acknowledgment form duly filled in with the delivery date March/April 1970 and
signed by the Butler Machine Tool Co.
No doubt a contract was then concluded. But on what terms? The sellers rely on their general
conditions and on their last letter which said: ‘in accordance with our revised quotation of May 23’ (which
had on the back the price variation clause). The buyers rely on the acknowledgment signed by the
sellers which accepted the buyer’s order ‘on the terms and conditions stated thereon’ (which did not
include a price variation clause).
If those documents are analysed in our traditional method, the result would seem to me to be this: the
quotation of May 23, 1969, was an offer by the sellers to the buyers containing 
the terms and conditions
on the back. The order of May 27, 1969, purported to be an acceptance of that offer in that it was for the
same machine at the same price, but it contained such additions as to cost of installation, date of
delivery and so forth that it was in law a rejection of the offer and constituted a counter-offer. That is clear
from 
Hyde
 
v. 
Wrench
 
(1840) 3 Beav 334. As Megaw J said in 
Trollope & Colls Ltd
 
v. 
Atomic Power
Constructions Ltd
 
[1963] 1 WLR 333, 337: ‘ … the counter-offer kills the original offer’. The letter of the
sellers of June 5, 1969, was an acceptance of that counter-offer, as is shown by the acknowledgment
which the sellers signed and returned to the buyers. The reference to the quotation of May 23 referred
only to the price and identity of the machine.
To go on with the facts of the case. The important thing is that the sellers did not keep the contractual
date of delivery which was March/April 1970. The machine was ready about September 1970 but by that
time the buyers’ production schedule had to be re-arranged as they could not accept delivery until
November 1970. Meanwhile the sellers had invoked the price increase clause. They sought to charge
the buyers an increase due to the rise in costs between May 27, 1969 (when the order was given), and
April 1, 1970 (when the machine ought to have been delivered). It came to £2,892. The buyers rejected
the claim. The judge held that the sellers were entitled to the sum of £2,892 under the price variation
clause. He did not apply the traditional method of analysis by way of offer and counter-offer. He said that
in the quotation of May 23, 1969, ‘one finds the price variation clause appearing under a most emphatic
heading stating that it is a term or condition that is to prevail’. So he held that it did prevail.
I have much sympathy with the judge’s approach to this case. In many of these cases our traditional
analysis of offer, counter-offer, rejection, acceptance and so forth is out of date. This was observed by
Lord Wilberforce in 
New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
A. M. Satterthwaite & Co Ltd
 
[1975] AC 154, 167.
The better way is to look at all the documents passing between the parties—and glean from them, or
from the conduct of the parties, whether they have reached agreement on all material points—even
though there may be differences between the forms and conditions printed on the back of them. As Lord
Cairns said in 
Brogden
 
v. 
Metropolitan Railway Co
 
(1877) 2 App Cas 666, 672:
‘ … there may be a 
consensus
 
between the parties far short of a complete mode of expressing it,
and that 
consensus
 
may be discovered from letters or from other documents of an imperfect and
incomplete description; … ’
Applying this guide, it will be found that in most cases when there is a ‘battle of forms’, there is a contract
as soon as the last of the forms is sent and received without objection being taken to it. That is well
observed in 
Benjamin’s Sale of Goods
, 9th edn (1974), p. 84. The difficulty is to decide which form, or
which part of which form, is a term or condition of the contract. In some cases the battle is won by the
man who fires the last shot. He is the man who puts forward the latest terms and conditions: and, if they
are not objected to by the other party, he may be taken to have agreed to them. Such was 
British Road
Services Ltd
 
v. 
Arthur V Crutchley & Co Ltd
 
[1968] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 271, 281–282, per Lord Pearson; and
the illustration given by Professor Guest in 
Anson’s Law of Contract
, 24th edn, pp. 37, 38 when he says
that ‘the terms of the contract consist of the terms of the offer subject to the modifications contained in
the acceptance’. In some cases the battle is won by the man who gets the blow in first. If he offers to sell
at a named price on the terms and conditions stated on the back: and the buyer orders the goods
purporting to accept the offer—on an order form with his own different terms and conditions on the back
—then if the difference is so material that it would affect the price, the buyer ought not to be allowed to
take advantage of the difference unless he draws it specifically to the attention of the seller. There are
yet other cases where the battle depends on the shots fired on both sides. There is a concluded 
contract
but the forms vary. The terms and conditions of both parties are to be construed together. If they can be
reconciled so as to give a harmonious result, all well and good. If differences are irreconcilable—so that
they are mutually contradictory—then the conflicting terms may have to be scrapped and replaced by a
reasonable implication.
In the present case the judge thought that the sellers in their original quotation got their blow in first:
especially by the provision that ‘these terms and conditions shall prevail over any terms and conditions in
the buyer’s order’. It was so emphatic that the price variation clause continued through all the
subsequent dealings and that the buyers must be taken to have agreed to it. I can understand that point
of view. But I think that the documents have to be considered as a whole. And, as a matter of
construction, I think the acknowledgment of June 5, 1969, is the decisive document. It makes it clear that
the contract was on the buyers’ terms and not on the sellers’ terms: and the buyers’ terms did not include
a price variation clause.
I would therefore allow the appeal and enter judgment for the defendants.
Lawton LJ
The modern commercial practice of making quotations and placing orders with conditions attached,
usually in small print, is indeed likely, as in this case to produce a battle of forms. The problem is how
should that battle be conducted? The view taken by Thesiger J was that the battle should extend over a
wide area and the court should do its best to look into the minds of the parties and make certain
assumptions. In my judgment, the battle has to be conducted in accordance with set rules. It is a battle
more on classical 18th century lines when convention decided who had the right to open fire first rather
than in accordance with the modern concept of attrition.
The rules relating to a battle of this kind have been known for the past 130-odd years. They were set
out by Lord Langdale MR in 
Hyde
 
v. 
Wrench
, 3 Beav 334, 337, to which Lord Denning MR has already
referred; and, if anyone should have thought they were obsolescent, Megaw J in 
Trollope & Colls Ltd
 
v.
Atomic Power Constructions Ltd
 
[1963] 1 WLR 333, 337 called attention to the fact that those rules are
still in force.
When those rules are applied to this case, in my judgment, the answer is obvious. The sellers started
by making an offer. That was in their quotation. The small print was headed by the following words:
‘General. All orders are accepted only upon and subject to the terms set out in our quotation and
the following conditions. These terms and conditions shall prevail over any terms and conditions in
the buyer’s order.’
That offer was not accepted. The buyers were only prepared to have one of these very expensive
machines on their own terms. Their terms had very material differences in them from the terms put
forward by the sellers. They could not be reconciled in any way. In the language of article 7 of the
Uniform Law on the Formation of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (see Uniform Laws on
International Sales Act 1967, Schedule 2) they did ‘materially alter the terms’ set out in the offer made by
the plaintiffs.
As I understand 
Hyde
 
v. 
Wrench
, 3 Beav 334, and the cases which have followed, the consequence
of placing the order in that way, if I may adopt Megaw J’s words [1963] 1 WLR 333, 337, was ‘to kill the
original offer’. It follows that the court has to look at what happened after the buyers made their counter-
offer. By letter dated June 4, 1969, the plaintiffs acknowledged receipt of the counter-offer, and they went
on in this way:
‘Details of this order have been passed to our Halifax works for attention and a formal
acknowledgment of order will follow in due course.’
That is clearly a reference to the printed tear-off slip which was at the bottom of the buyers’ counter-offer.
By letter dated June 5, 1969, the sales office manager at the plaintiffs’ Halifax factory completed that
tear-off slip and sent it back to the buyers.
It is true, as counsel for the sellers has reminded us, that the return of that printed slip was
accompanied by a letter which had this sentence in it: ‘This is being entered in accordance with our
revised quotation of May 23 for delivery in 10/11 months’. I agree with Lord Denning MR that, in a
business sense, that refers to the quotation as to the price and the identity of the machine, and it does
not bring into the contract the small print conditions on the back of the quotation. Those small print
conditions had disappeared from the story. That was when the contract was made. At that date it was a
fixed price contract without a price escalation clause.
As I pointed out in the course of argument to counsel for the sellers, if the letter of June 5 which
accompanied the form acknowledging the terms which the buyers had specified had amounted to a
counter-offer, then in my judgment the parties never were ad idem. It cannot be said that the buyers
accepted the counter-offer by reason of the fact that ultimately they took physical delivery of the
machine. By the time they took physical delivery of the machine, they had made it clear by
correspondence that they were not accepting that there was any price escalation clause in any contract
which they had made with the plaintiffs.
I agree with Lord Denning MR that this appeal should be allowed.
Bridge LJ
Schedule 2 to the Uniform Laws on International Sales Act 1967 is headed ‘The Uniform Law on the
Formation of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods’. To the limited extent that that Schedule is
already in force in the law of this country, it would not in any event be applicable to the contract which is
the subject of this appeal because that was not a contract of international sale of goods as defined in
that statute.
We have heard, nevertheless, an interesting discussion on the question of the extent to which the
terms of article 7 of that Schedule are mirrored in the common law of England today. No difficulty arises
about paragraph 1 of the article, which provides: ‘An acceptance containing additions, limitations or other
modifications shall be a rejection of the offer and shall constitute a counter-offer’. But paragraph 2 of the
article is in these terms:
‘However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but which contains additional or
different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer shall constitute an acceptance
unless the offeror promptly objects to the discrepancy; if he does not so object, the terms of the
contract shall be the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the acceptance.’
For my part, I consider it both unnecessary and undesirable to express any opinion on the question
whether there is any difference between the principle expressed in that paragraph 2 and the principle
which would prevail in the common law of England today without reference to that paragraph, but it was
presumably a principle analogous to that expressed in paragraph 2 of article 7 which the editor of
Anson’s Law of Contract
, 24th edn, Professor Guest, had in mind in the passage from that work which
was quoted in the judgment of Lord Denning MR. On any view, that passage goes a good deal further
than the principle expressed in article 7 of the Act of 1967, and I entirely agree with Lord Denning MR
that it goes too far.
But when one turns from those interesting and abstruse areas of the law to the plain facts of this
case, this case is nothing like the kind of case with which either the makers of the convention which
embodied article 7 of Schedule 2 or the editor of 
Anson
, 24th edn, had in mind in the passages referred
to, because this is a case which on its facts is plainly governed by what I may call the classical doctrine
that a counter-offer amounts to a rejection of an offer and puts an end to the effect of the offer.
The first offer between the parties here was the plaintiff sellers’ quotation dated May 23, 1969. The
conditions of sale in the small print on the back of that document, as well as embodying the price
variation clause, to which reference has been made in the judgments already delivered, embodied a
number of other important conditions. There was a condition providing that orders should in no
circumstances be cancelled without the written consent of the sellers and should only be cancelled on
terms which indemnified the sellers against loss. There was a condition that the sellers should not be
liable for any loss or damage from delay however caused. There was a condition purporting to limit the
sellers’ liability for damage due to defective workmanship or materials in the goods sold. And there was a
condition providing that the buyers should be responsible for the cost of delivery.
When one turns from that document to the buyers’ order of May 27, 1969, it is perfectly clear not only
that that order was a counter-offer but that it did not purport in any way to be an acceptance of the terms
of the sellers’ offer dated May 23. In addition, when one compares the terms and conditions of the
buyers’ offer, it is clear that they are in fact contrary in a number of vitally important respects to the
conditions of sale in the sellers’ offer. Amongst the buyers’ proposed conditions are conditions that the
price of the goods shall include the cost of delivery to the buyers’ premises; that the buyers shall be
entitled to cancel for any delay in delivery; and a condition giving the buyers a right to reject if on
inspection the goods are found to be faulty in any respect.
The position then was, when the sellers received the buyers’ offer of May 27, that that was an offer
open to them to accept or reject. They replied in two letters dated June 4 and 5 respectively. The letter of
June 4 was an informal acknowledgment of the order, and the letter of June 5 enclosed the formal
acknowledgment, as Lord Denning MR and Lawton LJ have said, embodied in the printed tear-off slip
taken from the order itself and including the perfectly clear and unambiguous sentence ‘We accept your
order on the terms and conditions stated thereon’. On the face of it, at that moment of time, there was a
complete contract in existence, and the parties were ad idem as to the terms of the contract embodied in
the buyers’ order.
Counsel for the sellers has struggled manfully to say that the contract concluded on those terms and
conditions was in some way overruled or varied by the references in the two letters dated June 4 and 5
to the quotation of May 23, 1969. The first refers to the machinery being as quoted on May 23. The
second letter says that the order has been entered in accordance with the quotation of May 23. I agree
with Lord Denning MR and Lawton LJ that that language has no other effect than to identify the
machinery and to refer to the prices quoted on May 23. But on any view, at its highest, the language is
equivocal and wholly ineffective to override the plain and unequivocal terms of the printed
acknowledgment of order which was enclosed with the letter of June 5. Even if that were not so and if
[counsel for the sellers] could show that the sellers’ acknowledgment of the order was itself a further
counter-offer, I suspect that he would be in considerable difficulties in showing that any later
circumstance amounted to an acceptance of that counter-offer in the terms of the original quotation of
May 23 by the buyers. But I do not consider that question further because I am content to rest upon the
view that there is nothing in the letter of June 5 which overrides the plain effect of the acceptance of the
order on the terms and conditions stated thereon.
I too would allow the appeal and enter judgment for the defendants.
Commentary
The decision in 
Butler
 
is helpfully discussed by R Rawlings (1979) 42 
MLR
 
715. All three
judgments have been set out in full and this is for a particular reason. It can often be
difficult to discern the 
ratio
 
of a particular case. There can be a tendency to attach
primary significance to the judgment that is given first, particularly when it is given by
Lord Denning! This is a temptation which must be resisted because closer analysis of the
judgments may reveal that Lord Denning’s approach did not in fact command the
support of the other judges. Where one judge dissents it is easy to spot the differences
between the judgments. But it is much more difficult where, as in 
Butler
, the judges
actually reach the same result but do so for different reasons.
The approach adopted by Lawton and Bridge LJJ is the traditional one, according to
which the court must ascertain whether or not an offer has been made and then whether
there has been an acceptance which mirrors the terms of the offer. The advantage of this
approach is its apparent certainty. The court must simply work through the
correspondence that has passed between the parties in search of a matching offer and
acceptance. The discovery of such a match will result in the conclusion that there is a
contract between the parties, whereas a failure to find it will result in there being no
contract. One problem with this approach is its tendency to result in the conclusion that
there is no contract between the parties. Discrepancies can frequently be found between
the respective sets of standard terms and conditions (indeed, in 
Butler
 
itself Bridge LJ
identified a number of discrepancies between the terms of the sellers and the terms of
the buyers) and the conclusion that no contract has been made may run counter to the
expectations of the parties who may have acted (possibly for a period of time) in the
belief that their relationship was governed by the terms of a contract. The appearance of
certainty can also be deceptive, as 
Butler
 
itself demonstrates. Both Lawton and Bridge
LJJ adopted what might be thought to be a rather strained interpretation of the facts in
order to reach the conclusion that the parties had in fact reached agreement. An analysis
of the documents that passed between the parties appears to suggest a degree of
inconsistency in the actions of the sellers. On the one hand, they signed the buyers’ tear-
off acknowledgement slip (thus indicating their assent to the buyers’ terms) but they
also referred to their own terms and conditions of business (thus appearing
simultaneously to insist that their own terms and conditions governed the parties’
relationship). It may be that their intention was to re-instate their own terms and
conditions but Lawton and Bridge LJJ were not convinced. In their view, the reference
to the sellers’ own terms and conditions was no more than a reference to the order. It
did not have the effect of over-riding the plain terms of the tear-off acknowledgement
slip which the sellers had signed.
Lord Denning took a very different approach from that taken by Lawton and Bridge LJJ.
He painted with a broad brush, rejecting as ‘out-of-date’ the traditional approach based
on the need to identify an offer and an acceptance which mirrors the terms of the offer.
In his view, the ‘better way’ was to examine all the documents passing between the
parties, to identify whether or not the parties ‘have reached agreement on all material
points, even though there may be differences between the forms and conditions printed
on the back of them’ (see also 
GHSP Incorporated
 
v. 
AB Electronic Ltd
 
[2010] EWHC
1828 (Comm), [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 432, where Burton J held that, although the parties
had entered into a contract, the terms of the contract were not to be found in the parties’
respective standard terms of business and see also 
Transformers & Rectifiers Ltd
 
v.
Needs Ltd
 
[2015] EWHC 269 (TCC), [2015] BLR 336 where a similar conclusion was
reached). The advantage of this approach is said to be its flexibility and its commercial
practicality. The negotiation process can often be both complex and 
protracted and it
can be difficult to analyse it in terms of offer and acceptance. Much better, it is argued,
to ask the question whether the parties have reached agreement and then to work out
the terms of the contract. This involves the judiciary in a two-stage process. At the first
stage the court must ask itself whether or not the parties have reached agreement and
concluded a contract while, at the second stage, the court must ask what the terms of the
contract are. The court has some flexibility at this second stage, as Lord Denning
recognizes (he acknowledges that, where the differences between the terms are
irreconcilable, the conflicting terms may have to be ‘scrapped and replaced by a
reasonable implication’). The difficulty with this view is that it tends to generate
uncertainty. For example, Lord Denning states that it suffices for the parties to reach
agreement on all ‘material points’. When is a point ‘material’ and when is it not? The
price of the goods would appear to be the most obvious ‘material’ factor, yet the parties
in 
Butler
 
failed to agree on the price and were nevertheless held to have concluded a
contract (unless it can be argued that the parties did in fact reach agreement on the price
and that a distinction must be drawn between the initial agreement as to the price,
which is material, and a price-escalation clause, which is not).
Assume that you are a lawyer instructed to act for the sellers in 
Butler
. How would you
advise them in relation to their conduct in future transactions? Presumably, you would
advise them not to sign the tear-off acknowledgement slip, but how, if it all, can they
ensure that their own terms and conditions govern the contracts into which they enter?
The sellers in 
Butler
 
included in their standard terms and conditions a clause to the
effect that the seller’s terms and conditions were to prevail over any inconsistent term in
the buyer’s terms and conditions but this was held not to be effective to incorporate the
seller’s terms into the contract. So there would appear to be no guarantee that the
seller’s terms will prevail. But the courts may generally be willing to draw an inference in
favour of the application of the seller’s terms. Thus it has been stated that ‘an offer to
buy containing the purchaser’s terms which is followed by an acknowledgement of
purchase containing the seller’s terms which is followed by delivery will (other things
being equal) result in a contract on the seller’s terms’ (
Tekdata Interconnections Ltd
 
v.
Amphenol Ltd
 
[2009] EWCA Civ 1209, [2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 357). This clearly suggests
that the onus is upon the buyer and that a seller who insists that its terms prevail and
refuses to sign the buyer’s tear-off acknowledgement slip will generally be in a strong
position.
The ‘battle of the forms’, as it has come to be known, is frequently encountered in
commercial practice but it is not easy to resolve. The problem is in large part created by
the parties themselves. Commercial parties generally wish to ensure that the contract is
made on their own standard terms of business and these standard terms often differ in
significant respects. The content of these standard terms differs from industry to
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
(vi)
(vii)
(viii)
industry but the types of clause commonly found in standard terms and conditions of
business (using a contract of sale as the typical example) include:
a retention of title clause, under which the seller, in essence, purports to retain
title to (or ownership of) the goods until they are paid for by the buyer (on which
see further 
12.3.2
);
a price-escalation clause, of the type in dispute on the facts of 
Butler
;
a clause making provision for the payment of interest on money owed by the
buyer to the seller (on which see further 
12.3.4
);
a force majeure clause (on which see further 
12.3.5
);
a hardship clause (on which see further 
12.3.9
);
a choice of law clause, namely a clause which stipulates the law that is to govern
the contract. This is a matter of particular importance where the parties to the
contract are in different jurisdictions. Both parties are likely to want the contract
to be governed by their own law and the negotiations on this particular point can
be very difficult (on which see further 
12.3.6
);
a jurisdiction clause or an arbitration clause. A jurisdiction clause is a clause
which identifies the court system which has jurisdiction to hear any dispute
arising out of the contract. Arbitration is a popular method of dispute resolution
and parties who do not wish to litigate a dispute in the courts (for reasons of cost,
speed, or publicity) may insert an arbitration clause into the contract (on which
see further 
12.3.7
);
a general clause which states that every contract of sale is subject to the seller’s
conditions of sale.
The approach adopted by the common law to the resolution of the battle of the forms
has been the subject of some criticism. As 
Butler
 
demonstrates, the traditional approach
of the courts has been to focus on the correspondence between the parties. The reason
for this is that contracts are said to be about what people promise and not what they do
(although one would normally expect their conduct to coincide with their promises).
An alternative view is that the courts should place greater emphasis on the conduct of
the parties: in other words, if the parties have acted as if a contract has been concluded
between them, then the law should be slow to turn round and conclude that the parties
did not, in fact, conclude a contract.
The proposition that the law should presume that there is a contract when the parties
have completed performance is not one that commands universal assent. Cases can be
found in which the courts have decided that no contract was concluded between the
parties, notwithstanding the fact that they had apparently acted on the basis that they
were in a contractual relationship. Such was the case in 
Mathieson Gee (Ayrshire) Ltd
 
v.
Quigley
 
1952 SC (HL) 38. The pursuers offered to supply machinery that could be used
to remove silt from the defender’s pond. The defender replied to this offer saying that he
accepted the pursuers’ offer to ‘remove the silt and deposit from the pond’. The pursuers
duly supplied the machinery and some drivers and they removed the deposit from the
pond. The defender refused to pay for the work done, claiming that the price was
excessive and that the pursuers were in breach of contract. The pursuers sued for £1,129
as being due under the contract. One of the issues before the House of Lords was
whether or not the parties had in fact concluded a contract. Lord Reid stated (at p. 43):
Both parties have throughout contended that these letters constitute a contract between them. No other case is
made by either party on record. The main issue between the parties has been what are the terms of this
contract. But in the Inner House Lord Carmont, who dissented, held that no contract could be found to have
existed between the parties, and before this House Counsel for the appellant supported this view as an
alternative to his main argument.
It is necessary, therefore, to consider whether it is open to a Court to decide that there was no 
consensus in
idem
 
and therefore no contract when neither party has any plea to that effect. In my opinion, it must be open to
a Court so to decide. No doubt if an agreement could be spelled out from the documents, the Court in such
circumstances would be inclined to do that and proceed to determine what were its terms. But if it clearly
appears to the Court 
that the true construction of the documents is such as to show that there was no
agreement, then it is plainly an impossible task for the Court to find the terms of an agreement which never
existed. If authority be necessary for this I find it in the speech of Lord Loreburn, LC, in 
Houldsworth
 
v. 
Gordon
Cumming
 
[1910] AC 537, 543, where he said: ‘It is not enough for the parties to agree in saying there was a
concluded contract if there was none, and then to ask a judicial decision as to what the contract in fact was. That
would be the same thing as asking us to make the bargain, whereas our sole function is to interpret it’. I must
therefore consider whether any agreement can be found in the terms of these two letters.
Lord Reid considered these letters and decided that no contract had been concluded
between the parties. The pursuers had offered to supply machinery, while the defender
had purported to accept an offer to remove the silt. The fact that the pursuers had
supplied drivers to operate the machinery and remove the silt did not demonstrate the
existence of a contract on the defender’s terms. Rather it was, in the words of Lord
Normand (at p. 42), a case of ‘conduct by the parties inconsistent with the contract
alleged by them’. This will strike some as being excessively formalistic. Why not focus on
what people do rather than what they promise to do? The answer to this question is to
•
(1)
(2)
(3)
•
(1)
be found in the fact that the basis of contractual obligations is the agreement of the
parties and, where that agreement is absent, there cannot be a liability in contract
(although there may be a liability to pay for the work done on some other basis, such as
the law of unjust enrichment, on which see later in this section).
An exclusive focus on the conduct of the parties will not provide a solution to all battle of
the forms cases. But it may be possible to produce a more acceptable solution to the
problems posed by the battle of the forms via a modification of the general offer and
acceptance rules. There have in fact been numerous attempts to modify the rules of offer
and acceptance and thereby prescribe a solution to the battle of the forms. In the main,
these attempts have sought to provide a more flexible framework that can accommodate
within the scope of contract law a degree of inconsistency between the respective sets of
standard terms. Thus trivial inconsistencies should not preclude the existence of a
contract between the parties, while ‘material’ or more significant inconsistencies may do
so. The difficulty is the obvious one, namely that of distinguishing between an
inconsistency which is sufficiently material to prevent a contract from coming into
existence and an inconsistency which is not material. The line has been drawn in
different places by different people, as can be demonstrated by the provisions dealing
with the battle of the forms to be found in the Vienna Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods, the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial
Contracts, and the Principles of European Contract Law (see also the references to
Article 7 of the Uniform Law on the Formation of Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods in the judgments of Lawton and Bridge LJJ in 
Butler
). The different solutions
proposed are as follows:
Vienna Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods: Article 19
A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additions, limitations, or
other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counter-offer.
However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or
different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an acceptance,
unless the offeror, without undue delay, objects orally to the discrepancy or 
dispatches a notice to
that effect. If he does not so object, the terms of the contract are the terms of the offer with the
modifications contained in the acceptance.
Additional or different terms relating, among other things, to the price, payment, quality, and
quantity of the goods, place and time of delivery, extent of one party’s liability to the other, or the
settlement of disputes are considered to alter the terms of the offer materially.
Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts: Article 2.1.11—Modified Acceptance
A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additions, limitations or other

modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counter-offer.
However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or
different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an acceptance,
unless the offeror, without undue delay, objects to the discrepancy. If the offeror does not object,
the terms of the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the
acceptance.
Principles of European Contract Law: Article 2:208—Modified Acceptance
A reply by the offeree which states or implies additional or different terms which would materially
alter the terms of the offer is a rejection and a new offer.
A reply which gives a definite assent to an offer operates as an acceptance even if it states or
implies additional or different terms, provided these do not materially alter the terms of the offer.
The additional or different terms then become part of the contract.
However, such a reply will be treated as a rejection of the offer if:
the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer; or
the offeror objects to the additional or different terms without delay; or
the offeree makes its acceptance conditional upon the offeror’s assent to the additional or
different terms, and the assent does not reach the offeree within a reasonable time.
Article 2:209—Conflicting General Conditions
If the parties have reached agreement except that the offer and acceptance refer to conflicting
general conditions of contract, a contract is nonetheless formed. The general conditions form part
of the contract to the extent that they are common in substance.
However, no contract is formed if one party:
has indicated in advance, explicitly, and not by way of general conditions, that it does not
intend to be bound by a contract on the basis of paragraph (1); or
without delay, informs the other party that it does not intend to be bound by such
contract.
General conditions of contract are terms which have been formulated in advance for an indefinite
number of contracts of a certain nature, and which have not been individually negotiated between
the parties.
It can be seen that there are noticeable similarities between these provisions. They tend
to build on one another. But there are also differences between them. For example,
Article 19 of the Vienna Convention attempts a non-exhaustive definition of a ‘material’
alteration, while no such attempt is to be found in the other instruments. The Principles
of European Contract Law also differ from the others in that they contain an additional
provision dealing 
with ‘conflicting general conditions’. Apply these different Articles to
the facts of 
Butler
 
v. 
Ex-Cell-O
. In doing so you will probably find that it is not at all easy
to work out how these Articles apply to the facts of 
Butler
 
and, indeed, it may be that
they produce different solutions. What lessons can we learn about the utility of these
provisions as a result of applying them to the facts of a particular case?
It should not be thought that the answer in all cases must be to find the existence of a
contract between the parties. There will be cases where the degree of inconsistency
between the sets of terms is such that it is not possible to conclude that there is a
contract in existence between the parties. Thus courts may have to resort to other areas
of the law, such as the law of unjust enrichment, in order to find solutions to some of the
cases that come before them.
An example of this process at work is to be found in the case of 
British Steel Corporation
v. 
Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co Ltd
 
[1984] 1 All ER 504. The parties were
involved in negotiations for the supply of steel components. The defendants sent to the
plaintiffs a letter of intent which stated their intention to enter into a contract and to do
so on their own standard terms. The plaintiffs did not respond to this but went ahead
with the manufacture of the components required, expecting a formal offer to follow
soon. Negotiations continued between the parties over the specifications of the steel
components, but no agreement was reached on matters such as progress payments, and
liability for loss arising from late delivery. The defendants refused to pay for the work
done and instead informed the plaintiffs that they were claiming damages for late
delivery and that this claim exceeded the plaintiffs’ claim for the contract price. The
positions adopted by the parties in the litigation were slightly unusual. The plaintiffs
contended that no contract had been concluded but that they were entitled to recover
the reasonable value of the work done (referred to as a ‘quantum meruit’ claim) in
‘quasi-contract’ (or, to use the terminology more commonly used today, the law of
unjust enrichment). The defendants, on the other hand, submitted that a contract had
been concluded between the parties. It was important for the defendants to establish the
existence of a contract in order for them to be able to bring a counterclaim for damages
for the loss suffered as a result of the alleged late delivery of the components and their
delivery out of sequence.
Robert Goff J decided that no contract had been concluded between the parties. He
considered, and rejected, two possible routes to a finding that a contract had been
concluded between the parties. The first he termed an ‘ordinary executory contract’. He
rejected the submission that the parties had entered into an executory contract because
he found that the parties had failed to reach agreement on important matters, such as
the price, delivery dates, and the applicable terms and conditions. The second he termed
an ‘if’ contract which he defined as ‘a contract under which A requests B to carry out a
certain performance and promises B that, if he does so, he will receive a certain
performance in return, usually remuneration for his performance’. Here the focus was
upon the fact that the plaintiffs had carried out work pursuant to the defendants’
request. But Robert Goff J found that no ‘if’ contract had been concluded because of the
failure of the parties to reach agreement on issues such as liability for late delivery.
The finding that the parties had not in fact concluded a contract has been criticized. For
example, Professor Atiyah (
An Introduction to the Law of Contract
 
(5th edn, Oxford
University Press, 1995), p. 154) argued that ‘it is strange to deny that a contract exists
when the parties are sufficiently agreed to manufacture and deliver and accept specified
goods, even though they have not agreed on all terms’. Indeed, in his view it is ‘absurd’
to decide that the parties had not concluded a contract. It is important to note that
Professor Atiyah focuses attention on the conduct of the parties and seeks to justify the
claim that the parties had concluded a contract by reference to their conduct rather than
their promises. Robert 
Goff J, by contrast, examined the conduct of the parties only for
the purpose of deciding whether or not they had reached agreement and, finding that
they had not reached agreement on a number of issues, held that no contract had been
concluded between the parties. In 
RTS Flexible Systems Ltd
 
v. 
Molkerei Alois Müller
GmbH & Co KG (UK Production)
 
[2010] UKSC 14, [2010] 1 WLR 753, [54] Lord Clarke
acknowledged that performance was a ‘very relevant factor’ pointing in the direction of
the existence of a contract but did not endorse the proposition that it ‘follows from the
fact that the work was performed that the parties must have entered into a contract’.
Instead, Lord Clarke (at [47]) affirmed that ‘the court should not impose binding
contracts on the parties which they have not reached’ and, in relation to 
British Steel
itself, he concluded (at [53]) that, on the facts:
there was an unresolved dispute as to whose standard terms were to apply. One set of terms provided no limit to
the seller’s liability for delay and the other excluded such liability altogether. We can understand why, in such a
case, if the buyer asks the seller to commence work ‘pending’ the parties entering into a formal contract, it is
difficult to infer from the seller acting on that request that he is assuming any responsibility for his
performance, ‘except such responsibility as will rest on him under the terms of the contract which both parties
confidently anticipate they will shortly enter into.’ By the last words, Robert Goff J was not suggesting that there
was, in the case before him, any contract governing the performance rendered, merely that the parties had
anticipated (wrongly in the event) that there would be.
The finding that the parties had not concluded a contract was of primary significance for
the defendants because it left their counterclaim without foundation. The plaintiffs, by
contrast, were held to be entitled to recover the reasonable value of the work done on a
quantum meruit
 
basis. The 
quantum meruit
 
claim identified by Robert Goff J is an
independent restitutionary (or unjust enrichment) claim. In order to succeed with such
a claim, a claimant must establish three things: first, that the defendant was enriched;
secondly, that the defendant was enriched at the claimant’s expense; and thirdly, that
the enrichment of the defendant was unjust. All three factors were held to have been
satisfied on the facts of the case. The difficulty that generally confronts a claimant in
bringing a restitutionary claim in a case such as 
British Steel
 
v. 
Cleveland Bridge
 
lies in
identifying and measuring the extent of the defendant’s enrichment. A claimant will
generally seek to establish the existence of an enrichment by proving that the defendant
requested performance of the particular services and that those services were performed
by the claimant. Where the terms of the request are satisfied no particular difficulties
should arise. More problematic is the case where the work is done but it does not
conform precisely to the terms of the request. In some cases the non-compliance will not
diminish the extent of the defendant’s enrichment (as was held to be the case in 
British
Steel
, where the allegation that the nodes had been delivered out of sequence did not
have an impact on the extent of the enrichment). In other cases, where the extent of the
departure from the terms of the request is greater (for example, the goods are defective),
then the courts are likely to scale down the value of the defendant’s enrichment in order
to reflect the fact that the defendant has not received the performance which it
requested (
Crown House Engineering Ltd
 
v. 
Amec Projects Ltd
 
(1990) 48 BLR 32).
Where the work is done on a ‘subject to contract’ basis then it is unlikely that the party
carrying out the work will be able to bring a restitutionary claim in order to recover the
reasonable value of the work done (
Regalian Properties plc
 
v. 
London Docklands
Development Corporation
 
[1995] 1 WLR 212). The effect of the ‘subject to contract’
stipulation will generally be that the loss lies where it falls in the event that the parties
fail to conclude a contract. 
At least this is the case where the work done by one party has
not been received by the other party. On the other hand, where, as in 
British Steel
, the
defendant actually takes possession of the work done by the claimant, the fact that the
work was done by the claimant on a ‘subject to contract’ basis will not generally suffice
to relieve the defendant of his liability to pay for the work done. It is, however, possible
for the parties to waive a ‘subject to contract’ stipulation. This may occur where the
parties continue with performance over a period of time and do so without continuing to
insist that the work is being done on a ‘subject to contract stipulation’ (
RTS Flexible
Systems Ltd
 
v. 
Molkerei Alois Müller GmbH & Co KG (UK Production)
 
[2010] UKSC 14,
[2010] 1 WLR 753). However, the courts tend to be reluctant to conclude that a ‘subject
to contract’ stipulation has been waived in the absence of clear evidence to that effect
(
Joanne Properties Ltd v Moneything Capital Ltd
 
[2020] EWCA Civ 1541).
3.3.2
 
Must the Acceptance be Communicated to
the Offeror?
The general rule is that an acceptance, to be valid, must be communicated to the offeror.
The general rule makes good sense. If it were otherwise, an offeror could be bound by an
acceptance of which he was blissfully unaware. The rule that an acceptance must be
communicated to the offeror is not without its exceptions. Thus the party making the
offer can waive the requirement of communication (on which see 
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic
Smoke Ball Co
 
[1893] 1 QB 256, 
3.2.1
), the rule does not apply when the reason for the
lack of communication is attributable to the fault of the offeror (on which see 
Entores
Ltd
 
v. 
Miles Far East Corporation
 
below) nor does it apply to communications sent by
post (see 
3.3.5
).
The leading case on the rule that acceptance must be communicated to the offeror is:
ENTORES LTD V. MILES FAR EAST CORPORATION
[1955] 2 QB 327, Court of Appeal
The plaintiffs, a company based in London, made an offer by telex (similar to a fax
machine) to the defendants, a company based in Amsterdam who acted as agents
for an American corporation. The defendants sent their acceptance of the offer by
telex. The plaintiffs applied for leave to serve notice of a writ on the American
corporation in New York. Their entitlement to do so turned on the answer to the
question: where was the contract made? Was the contract made when the
defendants sent their acceptance by telex (i.e., in Amsterdam) or was it made
when the telex was received on the plaintiffs’ machine (i.e., in London)? It was only
if the contract was made in England that the court had jurisdiction to grant leave to
serve out of the jurisdiction. It was held that the contract was formed when the
communication of the acceptance was received by the plaintiffs in London so that
the English courts had jurisdiction and that this was a proper case for service out
of the jurisdiction.
Denning LJ
[after setting out the facts continued]
The question for our determination is, where was the contract made?
When a contract is made by post it is clear law throughout the common law countries that the
acceptance is complete as soon as the letter is put into the post box, and that is the place 
where the
contract is made. But there is no clear rule about contracts made by telephone or by Telex.
Communications by these means are virtually instantaneous and stand on a different footing.
The problem can only be solved by going in stages. Let me first consider a case where two people
make a contract by word of mouth in the presence of one another. Suppose, for instance, that I shout an
offer to a man across a river or a courtyard but I do not hear his reply because it is drowned by an
aircraft flying overhead. There is no contract at that moment. If he wishes to make a contract, he must
wait until the aircraft is gone and then shout back his acceptance so that I can hear what he says. Not
until I have his answer am I bound. …
Now take a case where two people make a contract by telephone. Suppose, for instance, that I make
an offer to a man by telephone and, in the middle of his reply, the line goes ‘dead’ so that I do not hear
his words of acceptance. There is no contract at that moment. The other man may not know the precise
moment when the line failed. But he will know that the telephone conversation was abruptly broken off,
because people usually say something to signify the end of the conversation. If he wishes to make a
contract, he must therefore get through again so as to make sure that I heard. Suppose next that the line
does not go dead, but it is nevertheless so indistinct that I do not catch what he says and I ask him to
repeat it. He then repeats it and I hear his acceptance. The contract is made, not on the first time when I
do not hear, but only the second time when I do hear. If he does not repeat it, there is no contract. The
contract is only complete when I have his answer accepting the offer.
Lastly take the Telex. Suppose a clerk in a London office taps out on the teleprinter an offer which is
immediately recorded on a teleprinter in a Manchester office, and a clerk at that end taps out an
acceptance. If the line goes dead in the middle of the sentence of acceptance, the teleprinter motor will
stop. There is then obviously no contract. The clerk at Manchester must get through again and send his
complete sentence. But it may happen that the line does not go dead, yet the message does not get
through to London. Thus the clerk at Manchester may tap out his message of acceptance and it will not
be recorded in London because the ink at the London end fails or something of that kind. In that case the
Manchester clerk will not know of the failure but the London clerk will know of it and will immediately
send back a message ‘not receiving’. Then, when the fault is rectified, the Manchester clerk will repeat
his message. Only then is there a contract. If he does not repeat it, there is no contract. It is not until his
message is received that the contract is complete.
In all the instances I have taken so far, the man who sends the message of acceptance knows that it
has not been received or he has reason to know it. So he must repeat it. But suppose that he does not
know that his message did not get home. He thinks it has. This may happen if the listener on the
telephone does not catch the words of acceptance, but nevertheless does not trouble to ask for them to
be repeated: or the ink on the teleprinter fails at the receiving end, but the clerk does not ask for the
message to be repeated: so that the man who sends an acceptance reasonably believes that his
message has been received. The offeror in such circumstances is clearly bound, because he will be
estopped from saying that he did not receive the message of acceptance. It is his own fault that he did
not get it. But if there should be a case where the offeror without any fault on his part does not receive
the message of acceptance—yet the sender of it reasonably believes it has got home when it has not—
then I think there is no contract.
My conclusion is that the rule about instantaneous communications between the parties is different
from the rule about the post. The contract is only complete when the acceptance is received by the
offeror, and the contract is made at the place where the acceptance is received.
In a matter of this kind, however, it is very important that the countries of the world should have the
same rule. I find that most of the European countries have substantially the same rule as that I have
stated. Indeed, they apply it to contracts by post as well as instantaneous communications. But in the
United States of America it appears as if instantaneous communications are treated in the same way as
postal communications. In view of this divergence, I think we must consider the matter on principle; and
so considered, I have come to the view I have stated, and I am glad to see that Professor Winfield in this
country (55 
Law Quarterly Review
, at p. 514) and Professor Williston in the United States of America
(Contracts, Vol. I, section 82) take the same view.
Applying the principles which I have stated, I think that the contract in this case was made in London
where the acceptance was received. It was therefore a proper case for service out of the jurisdiction.
Birkett LJ
… In my opinion, the cases governing the making of contracts by letters passing through the post have
no application to the making of contracts by Telex communications. The ordinary rule of law, to which the
special considerations governing contracts by post are exceptions, is that the acceptance of an offer
must be communicated to the offeror and that the place where the contract is made is the place where
the offeror receives the notification of the acceptance by the offeree.
If a Telex instrument in Amsterdam is used to send to London the notification of the acceptance of an
offer, the contract is complete when the Telex instrument in London receives the notification of the
acceptance (usually at the same moment that the message is being printed in Amsterdam) and the
acceptance is then notified to the offeror, and the contract is made in London.
Parker LJ
 
delivered a concurring judgment.
Commentary
Denning LJ expressly distinguishes between the case of ‘instantaneous communications
between the parties’ and the case where the means of communication chosen by the
parties is the post. As we shall see (
3.3.5
), the rule that the acceptance must be
communicated to the offeror does not apply to postal communications, the general rule
being that acceptance takes place when the acceptance is posted, not when it is received.
The reasoning of Denning LJ in the paragraph beginning ‘Lastly take the Telex’ and the
next paragraph appears to be equally applicable to faxes, in that the sender of a fax
message will usually receive a transmission report which will indicate whether or not the
fax has been sent successfully.
The decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Entores
 
has since been approved by the House of
Lords in 
Brinkibon Ltd
 
v. 
Stahag-Stahl und Stahlwarenhandelsgesellschaft mbH
[1983] 2 AC 34. The issue in 
Brinkibon
 
was the same as that which arose on the facts of
Entores
 
and the conclusion of the House of Lords was the same, namely that, in the case
of communications by telex, the acceptance is effective when it is communicated to the
offeror with the result that the contract is concluded in the jurisdiction where the offeror
is located (on the facts of 
Brinkibon
 
this was Vienna). Their Lordships expressly
declined 
the invitation to overrule 
Entores
. The essence of the reasoning of their
Lordships in 
Brinkibon
 
is to be found in the following two passages:
Lord Wilberforce
In this situation, with a general rule covering instantaneous communication inter praesentes, or at a distance,
with an exception applying to non-instantaneous communication at a distance, how should communications by
telex be categorised? In 
Entores Ltd
 
v. 
Miles Far East Corporation
 
[1955] 2 QB 327 the Court of Appeal
classified them with instantaneous communications. Their ruling, which has passed into the textbooks,
including Williston on Contracts, 3rd edn (1957), appears not to have caused either adverse comment, or any
difficulty to business men. I would accept it as a general rule. Where the condition of simultaneity is met, and
where it appears to be within the mutual intention of the parties that contractual exchanges should take place in
this way, I think it a sound rule, but not necessarily a universal rule.
Since 1955 the use of telex communication has been greatly expanded, and there are many variants on it.
The senders and recipients may not be the principals to the contemplated contract. They may be servants or
agents with limited authority. The message may not reach, or be intended to reach, the designated recipient
immediately: messages may be sent out of office hours, or at night, with the intention, or upon the assumption,
that they will be read at a later time. There may be some error or default at the recipient’s end which prevents
receipt at the time contemplated and believed in by the sender. The message may have been sent and/or
received through machines operated by third persons and many other variations may occur. No universal rule
can cover all such cases: they must be resolved by reference to the intentions of the parties, by sound business
practice and in some cases by a judgment where the risks should lie: see 
Household Fire and Carriage Accident
Insurance Co Ltd
 
v. 
Grant
 
(1879) 4 Ex D 216, 227 per Baggallay LJ and 
Henthorn
 
v. 
Fraser
 
[1892] 2 Ch 27 per
Lord Herschell.
The present case is, as 
Entores Ltd
 
v. 
Miles Far East Corporation
 
[1955] 2 QB 327 itself, the simple case of
instantaneous communication between principals, and, in accordance with the general rule, involves that the
contract (if any) was made when and where the acceptance was received. This was on May 4, 1979, in Vienna.
Lord Brandon of Oakbrook
My Lords, I am not persuaded that the 
Entores
 
case [1955] 2 QB 327, was wrongly decided and should therefore
be overruled. On the contrary, I think that it was rightly decided and should be approved. The general principle
of law applicable to the formation of a contract by offer and acceptance is that the acceptance of the offer by the
offeree must be notified to the offeror before a contract can be regarded as concluded, 
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic Smoke
Ball Co
 
[1893] 1 QB 256, 262, per Lindley LJ. The cases on acceptance by letter and telegram constitute an
exception to the general principle of the law of contract stated above. The reason for the exception is
commercial expediency: see, for example, 
Imperial Land Co of Marseilles, In re (Harris’ Case)
 
(1872) LR 7 Ch
App 587, 692 per Mellish LJ. That reason of commercial expediency applies to cases where there is bound to be
a substantial interval between the time when the acceptance is sent and the time when it is received. In such
cases the exception to the general rule is more convenient, and makes on the whole for greater fairness, than the
general rule itself would do. In my opinion, however, that reason of commercial expediency does not have any
application when the means of communication 
employed between the offeror and the offeree is instantaneous
in nature, as is the case when either the telephone or telex is used. In such cases the general principle relating to
the formation of contracts remains applicable, with the result that the contract is made where and when the
telex of acceptance is received by the offeror.
When is a telex message communicated to the offeror? Is it when the message is
received on the telex machine or when it is read by the offeror? The difficulty with the
latter possibility is that the sender will generally have no way of knowing when the
message was in fact read by the offeror. This being the case, a court is more likely to
conclude that the message is communicated at the moment of receipt provided that it
has been sent during normal business hours. Where the message is sent outside of office
hours then one might expect the court to conclude that it was not communicated until
the office re-opened for business, or shortly thereafter (such a conclusion was reached in
the context of a notice of withdrawal of a ship under a charterparty in 
The Brimnes
[1975] QB 929 and could be applied in this context by way of analogy).
In 
Entores
 
Denning LJ stated that ‘it is very important that the countries of the world
should have the same rule’. Do you agree? Does this suggest that English law should
adopt the Unidroit Principles or the Principles of European Contract Law in an attempt
to achieve this level of uniformity?
3.3.3
 
Prescribed Method of Acceptance
It is open to an offeror to state in the terms of his offer that an acceptance must assume
a particular form or be sent to a particular place. In such a case, is the offeror bound by a
purported acceptance of the offer that does not comply with the requirements stipulated
in the offer? Obviously, it is open to the offeror to waive the requirement that the
acceptance assume a particular form, provided that the party sending the acceptance is
not adversely affected thereby. But what of the case where there has been no waiver by
the offeror and the party who submits the purported acceptance has not complied with
the strict terms of the offer? Is the purported acceptance inevitably ineffective? The
answer depends upon a proper interpretation of the terms of the offer. If the form of the
acceptance is mandatory then a purported acceptance that assumes a different form will
not be effective. On the other hand, if it is not mandatory and the method of acceptance
adopted differs from that stipulated but is no less advantageous to the offeror then the
acceptance may be effective to conclude a contract between the parties. In 
Manchester
Diocesan Council for Education
 
v. 
Commercial and General Investments Ltd
 
[1970] 1
WLR 241, 246 Buckley J stated:
It may be that an offeror, who by the terms of his offer insists on acceptance in a particular manner, is entitled
to insist that he is not bound unless acceptance is effected or communicated in that precise way, although it
seems probable that, even so, if the other party communicates his acceptance in some other way, the offeror
may by conduct or otherwise waive his right to insist on the prescribed method of acceptance. Where, however,
the offeror has prescribed a particular method of acceptance, but not in terms insisting that only acceptance in
that mode shall be binding, I am of opinion that acceptance communicated to the offeror 
by any other mode
which is no less advantageous to him will conclude the contract. Thus in 
Tinn
 
v. 
Hoffman & Co
 
(1873) 29 LT
271, 274, where acceptance was requested by return of post, Honeyman J said:
‘That does not mean exclusively a reply by letter by return of post, but you may reply by telegram or by
verbal message, or by any means not later than a letter written and sent by return of post … ’
If an offeror intends that he shall be bound only if his offer is accepted in some particular manner, it must be for
him to make this clear.
On the facts of the case Buckley J concluded that the prescribed form of acceptance was
not the only valid method of acceptance with the result that the offeror was bound by a
method of acceptance which differed from the prescribed method but was no less
advantageous to it. It is therefore incumbent upon an offeror to state in clear terms that
an acceptance must assume a particular form. For the avoidance of doubt it may be
necessary for the offeror to go further and state that this form is mandatory or that an
acceptance in any other form will not be valid. An offeror who fails to do this may be
vulnerable to the argument that the form of acceptance chosen is valid because it is
equally efficacious from the point of view of the offeror. When considering whether or
not the actual form of the acceptance is no less advantageous to the offeror than the
prescribed method, it is necessary to ascertain the object that the offeror had in mind
when prescribing the form of the acceptance. For example, the object behind a
stipulation that the acceptance must be in writing may be to ensure that the acceptance
is in permanent form, in which case an oral acceptance will not suffice. Alternatively,
where the object behind the stipulation is to ensure that the acceptance is received
within a given time-frame, an alternative mode of acceptance which is just as quick (for
example, email rather than fax) may be effective to conclude a contract.
3.3.4
 
Can Silence Amount to Acceptance?
The general rule is that silence does not amount to an acceptance and the rule is a good
one. Were the law otherwise traders would have every incentive to send out offers to sell
goods at a particular price accompanied by a statement to the effect that the trader will
regard the offer to sell as having been accepted unless the customer informs him to the
contrary within a stipulated period of time. The law would be unduly burdensome if it
imposed on people an obligation to take positive steps to rejected unwanted offers. Thus
it is that the law puts the onus on the person to whom the offer has been made to
demonstrate that he has, by some positive conduct on his part, accepted the offer.
Silence does not generally constitute such ‘positive conduct’. It is, by its nature,
equivocal; it could be consistent with a rejection of the offer, indifference to the offer, or
acceptance of it.
The issue that must be considered is not the validity of the general rule, but whether or
not there should be exceptions to it. Take the following example. X sends an offer to Y
and states that he, X, will regard the offer as having been accepted unless Y informs him
to the contrary within seven days. Y decides to accept the offer but does not
communicate his acceptance to X because he believes that there is no need to do so. X
subsequently informs Y that, in his view, no contract has been concluded between the
parties as a result of Y’s failure to communicate his acceptance to X. Does Y have a claim
against X for breach of contract? According to the general rule, he does not because
silence does not amount to an acceptance. 
This seems harsh. If the reason for the
general rule is a desire to protect Y from the burden of having to take positive steps to
reject the imposition of unwanted contractual obligations, why should we in effect
punish Y for this failure to communicate his acceptance when he does in fact wish to
conclude a contract? Should the law not recognize an exception to the general rule in
order to enable Y to establish the existence of a contract? It would appear that it does
not and the reason for this is to be found in the following case:
FELTHOUSE V. BINDLEY
(1862) 11 CBNS 869, 142 ER 1037, Court of Common Pleas
The plaintiff claimed that he had purchased a horse from his nephew. After some
negotiations, the plaintiff wrote a letter to his nephew on 2 January 1862 in which
he offered to buy the horse for £30 15s. He concluded his letter by stating: ‘If I hear
no more about him, I consider the horse mine at £30 15s.’ The nephew did not
reply to this letter. On 25 February the defendant auctioneer, who had been
instructed by the nephew to sell his farming stock, sold the stock at auction. The
nephew told the defendant that the horse had already been sold but the auctioneer
mistakenly included it in the sale and sold it to a third party. The auctioneer
acknowledged his mistake in a letter to the plaintiff written on 26 February and the
nephew also wrote to the plaintiff on 27 February in which he acknowledged their
‘previous arrangement’ in relation to the sale of the horse. The plaintiff brought an
action for the conversion of the horse. The claim failed on the ground that the
plaintiff could not show that he had acquired title to the horse before it was sold by
the auctioneer on 25 February.
Willes J
[set out the facts and continued]
It is clear that there was no complete bargain on the 2nd of January: and it is also clear that the uncle
had no right to impose upon the nephew a sale of his horse for £30 15s. unless he chose to comply with
the condition of writing to repudiate the offer. The nephew might, no doubt, have bound his uncle to the
bargain by writing to him: the uncle might also have retracted his offer at any time before acceptance. It
stood an open offer: and so things remained until the 25th of February, when the nephew was about to
sell his farming stock by auction. The horse in question being catalogued with the rest of the stock, the
auctioneer (the defendant) was told that it was already sold. It is clear, therefore, that the nephew in his
own mind intended his uncle to have the horse at the price which he (the uncle) had named—£30 15s:
but he had not communicated such his intention to his uncle, or done anything to bind himself. Nothing,
therefore, had been done to vest the property in the horse in the plaintiff down to the 25th of February,
when the horse was sold by the defendant. It appears to me that, independently of the subsequent
letters, there had been no bargain to pass the property in the horse to the plaintiff, and therefore that he
had no right to complain of the sale. Then, what is the effect of the subsequent correspondence? The
letter of the auctioneer amounts to nothing. The more important letter is that of the nephew, of the 27th of
February, which is relied on as showing that he intended to accept and did accept the terms offered by
his uncle’s letter of the 2nd of January. That letter, however, may be treated either as an acceptance
then for the first time made by him, or as a memorandum of a bargain complete before the 25th of
February, sufficient within the statute of frauds. It seems to me that the former is the more likely
construction: and, if so, it is clear that the plaintiff cannot recover. But, assuming that there had been a
complete parol bargain before the 25th of February, and 
that the letter of the 27th was a mere
expression of the terms of that prior bargain, and not a bargain then for the first time concluded, it would
be directly contrary to the decision of the Court of Exchequer in 
Stockdale
 
v. 
Dunlop
, 6 M & W 224, to
hold that that acceptance had relation back to the previous offer so as to bind third persons in respect of
a dealing with the property by them in the interim.
Keating J
I am of the same opinion. Had the question arisen as between the uncle and the nephew, there would
probably have been some difficulty. But, as between the uncle and the auctioneer, the only question we
have to consider is whether the horse was the property of the plaintiff at the time of the sale on the 25th
of February. It seems to me that nothing had been done at that time to pass the property out of the
nephew and vest it in the plaintiff. A proposal had been made, but there had before that day been no
acceptance binding the nephew.
Byles J
 
delivered a short judgment in which he expressed his agreement with
Willes J.
Commentary
The claim brought by the uncle was a claim in conversion against the auctioneer.
Conversion is a tort that is committed by dealing with goods in a manner inconsistent
with the rights of the true owner. In order to be able to bring a claim in conversion, the
uncle had to prove that he had an immediate right to possession of the horse, and this in
turn depended upon whether or not he had concluded a contract with his nephew for the
purchase of the horse prior to its sale on 25 February. The Court of Common Pleas
concluded that no such contract had been concluded and their decision to this effect was
subsequently affirmed by the Exchequer Chamber: (1863) 7 LT 835.
The result in 
Felthouse
 
has been criticized by some commentators. The difficulty with
the case lies in the fact that the nephew had told the defendant auctioneer, prior to the
sale of the horse by the auctioneer to a third party, that it had already been sold.
Professor Miller (‘
Felthouse
 
v. 
Bindley
 
Revisited’ (1972) 35 
MLR
 
489, 491) has criticized
Felthouse
 
in the following terms:
The Common Pleas held for the auctioneer on the ground that the plaintiff had no title to sue since at the date of
the auction the nephew had not effectively accepted the offer. Given that he had admittedly told the auctioneer
that the horse was reserved for his uncle and that the latter had equally assumed that this was so, it is not clear
why anything further should have been regarded as essential to the formation of a contract. On balance it is
submitted that the approach of the Common Pleas was wrong in principle and that the actual result of the case
can only be supported because there had been no delivery, part payment or memorandum in writing to satisfy
the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.
Felthouse
 
v. 
Bindley
 
would have been more difficult had the litigation taken place
between the nephew and the uncle rather than between the uncle and the auctioneer.
Suppose that the nephew had refrained from selling the horse and the uncle then denied
that he was bound to purchase it. Could the nephew have brought a claim against the
uncle for breach 
of contract? Given that the uncle had himself stated that he did not
expect to hear from his nephew, any reliance placed by him on his nephew’s failure to
communicate his acceptance would have been unmeritorious but his entitlement to do
so would appear to follow from a strict application of the rule laid down in 
Felthouse
.
While silence generally does not amount to an acceptance, it is clear law that the
conduct of the offeree can amount to an acceptance (see, for example, 
Brogden
 
v.
Metropolitan Railway
 
(1877) 2 App Cas 666 and 
Reveille Independent LLC
 
v. 
Anotech
International (UK) Ltd
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 443, 166 Con LR 79). What is the difference
between conduct (which can amount to an acceptance) and silence (which cannot)? In
other words, how much does the law require by way of positive conduct before the line
between silence and conduct is crossed? The answer may be that the law does not
require much by way of conduct on the part of the offeree. In 
Rust
 
v. 
Abbey Life
Assurance Co Ltd
 
[1979] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 334 the issue before the Court of Appeal was
whether or not a contract had been concluded between the plaintiff insured and the
defendant insurer. On the facts it was held that the defendants had accepted the
plaintiff’s offer, probably by issuing her with the policy. But, even making the
assumption that the policy constituted an offer rather than an acceptance, it was held
that the parties were in a contractual relationship. Brandon LJ stated (at p. 340):
[T]he plaintiff had the policy in her possession at the end of October, 1973. She raised no objection to it of any
kind until some seven months later. While it may well be that in many cases silence or inactivity is not evidence
of acceptance, having regard to the facts of this case and the history of the transaction between the parties …, it
seems to me to be an inevitable inference from the conduct of the plaintiff in doing and saying nothing for seven
months that she accepted the policy as a valid contract between herself and the first defendants.
Rust
 
was later cited with approval by Lord Steyn (who was himself counsel for the
defendant insurers in 
Rust
) in 
Vitol SA
 
v. 
Norelf Ltd
 
[1996] AC 800, 811 for the
proposition that ‘while the general principle is that there can be no acceptance of an
offer by silence, our law does in exceptional cases recognise acceptance of an offer by
silence’. The precise scope of these exceptions has not been judicially established (for
further recognition of the fact that there are exceptions to the general rule, albeit that
they operate within very narrow limits see 
Allied Marine Transport Ltd
 
v. 
Vale do Rio
Doce Navegacao SA (The Leonidas D)
 
[1985] 1 WLR 925, 937).
3.3.5
 
The Postal Rule
When does an acceptance sent through the post become effective? Is it when the
acceptance is posted by the offeree, when it is posted through the letter box of the
offeror, or when it is opened and read by the offeror? One might have expected the
answer to be that acceptance occurs upon communication of the acceptance to the
offeror (whether that communication takes place upon receipt or upon actual reading of
the letter) but English law has adopted the former view, namely that acceptance takes
place upon posting of the letter of acceptance. This rule has been the subject of
considerable criticism and it has not been adopted in many other jurisdictions in the
world. Yet the rule is one of some antiquity in English law (the case that is commonly
cited as authority for the existence of the rule is 
Adams
 
v. 
Lindsell
 
(1818) 1 B & Ald 681
but its place was not secured until the later decision of the House of Lords in 
Dunlop
 
v.
Higgins
 
(1848) 1 HLC 381) and is now unlikely to be uprooted 
judicially. Rather, the
courts are likely to widen the exceptions to the general rule and not to attempt to abolish
the general rule itself. That this is so can be demonstrated by reference to the following
case:
HOLWELL SECURITIES LTD V. HUGHES
[1974] 1 WLR 155, Court of Appeal
Under a contract with the defendant, the plaintiffs were granted an option to
purchase land. Clause 2 of the agreement provided:
‘THE said option shall be exercisable by notice in writing to the [defendant] at any time within six months
from the date hereof … ’
The plaintiffs purported to exercise that option by a letter sent by their solicitors on
14 April 1972 but the defendant never received the letter. The defendant refused to
accept that the option had been validly exercised. The plaintiffs sought specific
performance of the option agreement. Their claim was rejected on the ground that
the option had not been validly exercised. The plaintiffs had failed to comply with
the requirements of clause 2 of the agreement in that they had failed to give the
defendant notice that they were exercising the option.
Russell LJ
It is not disputed that the plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter dated April 14, 1972, addressed to the defendant at
his residence and place of work, the house which was the subject of the option to purchase, was posted
by ordinary post in a proper way, enclosing a copy of the letter of the same date delivered by hand to the
defendant’s solicitors. It is not disputed that the letter and enclosure somehow went astray and never
reached the house nor the defendant. It is not disputed that the language of the letter and enclosure
would have constituted notice of exercise of the option had they reached the defendant. It is not
contended that the handing of the letter to the solicitor constituted an exercise of the option.
The plaintiffs’ main contention below and before this court has been that the option was exercised
and the contract for sale and purchase was constituted at the moment that the letter addressed to the
defendant with its enclosure was committed by the plaintiffs’ solicitors to the proper representative of the
postal service, so that its failure to reach its destination is irrelevant.
It is the law in the first place that, prima facie, acceptance of an offer must be communicated to the
offeror. Upon this principle the law has engrafted a doctrine that, if in any given case the true view is that
the parties contemplated that the postal service might be used for the purpose of forwarding an
acceptance of the offer, committal of the acceptance in a regular manner to the postal service will be
acceptance of the offer so as to constitute a contract, even if the letter goes astray and is lost. Nor, as
was once suggested, are such cases limited to cases in which the offer has been made by post. It
suffices I think at this stage to refer to 
Henthorn
 
v. 
Fraser
 
[1892] 2 Ch 27. In the present case, as I read a
passage in the judgment below [1973] 1 WLR 757, 764D, Templeman J concluded that the parties here
contemplated that the postal service might be used to communicate acceptance of the offer (by exercise
of the option); and I agree with that.
But that is not and cannot be the end of the matter. In any case, before one can find that the basic
principle of the need for communication of acceptance to the offeror is displaced by this artificial concept
of communication by the act of posting, it is necessary that the offer is in its 
terms consistent with such
displacement and not one which by its terms points rather in the direction of actual communication. We
were referred to 
Henthorn
 
v. 
Fraser
 
and to the obiter dicta of Farwell J in 
Bruner
 
v. 
Moore
 
[1904] 1 Ch
305, which latter was a case of an option to purchase patent rights. But in neither of those cases was
there apparently any language in the offer directed to the manner of acceptance of the offer or exercise
of the option.
The relevant language here is, ‘The said option shall be exercised by notice in writing to the intending
vendor … ’, a very common phrase in an option agreement. There is, of course, nothing in that phrase to
suggest that the notification to the defendant could not be made by post. But the requirement of ‘notice
… to’, in my judgment, is language which should be taken expressly to assert the ordinary situation in
law that acceptance requires to be communicated or notified to the offeror, and is inconsistent with the
theory that acceptance can be constituted by the act of posting, referred to by 
Anson’s Law of Contract
,
23rd edn (1969), p. 47, as ‘acceptance 
without notification
’.
It is of course true that the instrument could have been differently worded. An option to purchase
within a period given for value has the characteristic of an offer that cannot be withdrawn. The instrument
might have said ‘The offer constituted by this option may be accepted in writing within six months’: in
which case no doubt the posting would have sufficed to form the contract. But that language was not
used, and, as indicated, in my judgment, the language used prevents that legal outcome. Under this
head of the case hypothetical problems were canvassed to suggest difficulties in the way of that
conclusion. What if the letter had been delivered through the letter-box of the house in due time, but the
defendant had either deliberately or fortuitously not been there to receive it before the option period
expired? This does not persuade me that the artificial posting rule is here applicable. The answer might
well be that in the circumstances the defendant had impliedly invited communication by use of an orifice
in his front door designed to receive communications.
Lawton LJ
… I turn now to what I have called the roundabout path to the same result. [Counsel for] the plaintiffs
submitted that the option was exercised when the letter was posted, as the rule relating to the
acceptance of offers by post did apply. The foundation of his argument was that the parties to this
agreement must have contemplated that the option might be, and probably would be, exercised by
means of a letter sent through the post. I agree. This, submitted [counsel for the plaintiffs], was enough
to bring the rule into operation. I do not agree. In 
Henthorn
 
v. 
Fraser
 
[1892] 2 Ch 27, Lord Herschell
stated the rule as follows, at p. 33:
‘Where the circumstances are such that it must have been within the contemplation of the parties
that, according to the ordinary usages of mankind, the post might be used as a means of
communicating the acceptance of an offer, the acceptance is complete as soon as it is posted.’
It was applied by Farwell J in 
Bruner
 
v. 
Moore
 
[1904] 1 Ch 305 to an option to purchase patent rights.
The option agreement, which was in writing, was silent as to the manner in which it was to be exercised.
The grantee purported to do so by a letter and a telegram.
Does the rule apply in 
all
 
cases where one party makes an offer which both he and the person with
whom he was dealing must have expected the post to be used as a means of accepting it? In my
judgment, it does not. First, it does not apply when the express terms of the offer specify that the
acceptance must reach the offeror. The public nowadays are familiar with this exception to the general
rule through their handling of football pool coupons. Secondly, it probably does not operate if its
application would produce manifest inconvenience and 
absurdity. This is the opinion set out in Cheshire
and Fifoot, 
Law of Contract
, 3rd edn (1952), p. 43. It was the opinion of Lord Bramwell as is seen by his
judgment in 
British & American Telegraph Co
 
v. 
Colson
 
(1871) LR 6 Exch 108, and his opinion is worthy
of consideration even though the decision in that case was overruled by this court in 
Household Fire and
Carriage Accident Insurance Co
 
v. 
Grant
 
(1879) 4 Ex D 216. The illustrations of inconvenience and
absurdity which Lord Bramwell gave are as apt today as they were then. Is a stockbroker who is holding
shares to the orders of his client liable in damages because he did not sell in a falling market in
accordance with the instructions in a letter which was posted but never received? Before the passing of
the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1970 (which abolished actions for breach of promise of
marriage), would a young soldier ordered overseas have been bound in contract to marry a girl to whom
he had proposed by letter, asking her to let him have an answer before he left and she had replied
affirmatively in good time but the letter had never reached him? In my judgment, the factors of
inconvenience and absurdity are but illustrations of a wider principle, namely, that the rule does not apply
if, having regard to all the circumstances, including the nature of the subject matter under consideration,
the negotiating parties cannot have intended that there should be a binding agreement until the party
accepting an offer or exercising an option had in fact communicated the acceptance or exercise to the
other. In my judgment, when this principle is applied to the facts of this case it becomes clear that the
parties cannot have intended that the posting of a letter should constitute the exercise of the option …
I would dismiss the appeal.
Buckley LJ
 
agreed with the judgment of Russell LJ.
Commentary
It can be seen from the judgment of Russell LJ that there are a number of requirements
that must be satisfied before the postal rule is applicable. The first is that the parties
must have contemplated that the postal service would be used for the purpose of
forwarding the acceptance of the offer. In 
Henthorn
 
v. 
Fraser
 
[1892] 2 Ch 27 the
plaintiff, who lived in Birkenhead, visited the defendants’ offices in Liverpool and, while
he was there, the defendants handed to him a written offer to sell to him property in
Birkenhead for £750. The offer took the form of an option to purchase within fourteen
days. On the following day, between 12.00 and 13.00, the defendants posted a letter to
the plaintiff purporting to withdraw their offer to sell. This letter reached the plaintiff’s
place of business between 17.00 and 18.00 on the same day but not before the plaintiff’s
solicitor had posted to the defendants a letter accepting the offer to sell the property for
£750. The letter of acceptance was posted at 15.50 and was delivered to the defendants’
offices at 20.30, after the offices had closed, with the result that the letter was not
opened until the following morning. The defendants maintained that they were not
bound to sell the property to the plaintiff because they had validly withdrawn their offer
before it was accepted. In particular, they argued that the rule that the contract is
complete as soon as the acceptance is posted had no application to the present facts
because they had not sent their offer to the plaintiff through the post; they had handed it
to him in person. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument. The applicability of the
postal rule depends, not on the medium by which the offer is communicated, but upon
whether the parties contemplated that the post might be used as a means of
communicating the acceptance. Lord Herschell stated (at p. 33) that:
although the Plaintiff received the offer at the Defendant’s office in Liverpool, he resided in another town, and it
must have been in contemplation that he would take the offer, which by its terms was to remain open for some
days, with him to his place of business, and those who made the offer must have known that it would be
according to the ordinary usages of mankind that if he accepted it he should communicate his acceptance by
means of the post.
This being the case, the postal rule was applicable with the result that the defendants’
revocation was ineffective because it was received by the plaintiff after the contract had
been concluded on the posting of the letter of acceptance at 15.50 (on the revocation of
an offer by post, see 
Byrne & Co
 
v. 
Van Tienhoven & Co
 
(1880) 5 CPD 344, 
3.4
, which
was applied by the Court of Appeal on the present facts).
Secondly, the parties can, expressly or impliedly, contract out of the rule that acceptance
takes place upon posting of the letter of acceptance. Indeed, it was held that the effect of
clause 2 of the contract in 
Holwell Securities
 
v. 
Hughes
 
was to exclude the operation of
the postal rule because the meaning of the phrase ‘notice in writing’ to the defendant
was to require communication or notification to the defendant and, for this purpose,
posting of the letter did not constitute ‘notice’.
It might have been thought that the fact that the letter never in fact reached the offeror
would have sufficed to prevent the existence of a valid acceptance. But this was not in
fact the case. Indeed, Russell LJ expressly accepted that, where the postal rule is
applicable, acceptance takes place ‘even if the letter goes astray and is lost’. Authority for
the latter proposition can be traced back to the decision of the Court of Appeal in
Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd
 
v. 
Grant
 
(1879) 4 Ex D 216.
The defendant applied for shares in a company. He was allotted shares but he never
received the letter informing him that shares had been allotted to him. The company
subsequently went into liquidation and the liquidator sought to recover from the
defendant the unpaid balance of the share price. The defendant denied that he was a
shareholder but his defence was unsuccessful. It was held that his offer to buy shares
was accepted when the notice of allotment was posted to him and the fact that the letter
subsequently went astray in the post did not have the effect of discharging the contract
that had already been made for the purchase of the shares. Thesiger LJ stated (at p.
223):
How … can a casualty in the post, whether resulting in delay, which in commercial transactions is often as bad
as no delivery, or in non-delivery, unbind the parties or unmake the contract? To me it appears that in practice
a contract complete upon the acceptance of an offer being posted, but liable to be put an end to by an accident
in the post, would be more mischievous than a contract only binding upon the parties to it upon the acceptance
actually reaching the offeror, and I can see no principle of law from which such an anomalous contract can be
deduced.
Lawton LJ recognizes the existence of a much wider exception to the postal rule. In his
view (Russell LJ does not comment on the point) the postal rule ‘does not operate if its
application would produce manifest inconvenience and absurdity’. In many ways it is
difficult to object to the proposition that a rule should not apply when it produces
‘manifest inconvenience and absurdity’ but much depends on what is meant by the
phrase. If adoption of such a principle requires departure from binding precedent then it
must be rejected. The fact that Lawton LJ draws support for his proposition from the
judgment of Bramwell B in 
British & American 
Telegraph Co
 
v. 
Colson
 
(1871) LR 6 Exch
108—which, as he acknowledges, was overruled by the Court of Appeal in 
Household
Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd
 
v. 
Grant
 
(1879) 4 Ex D 216 (in which
Bramwell LJ (as he had then become) dissented)—suggests that the breadth of his
proposed exception should be viewed with some suspicion.
Why has English law adopted the postal rule? Why does acceptance take place at the
moment of posting the letter and not the moment of receipt? The competing arguments
have been neatly summarized as follows (Treitel, 
The Law of Contract
 
(15th edn, Sweet
& Maxwell, 2020, edited by Edwin Peel), para 2–032 (footnotes omitted)):
Various reasons for the rule have been suggested. One is that the offeror must be considered as making the offer
all the time that his offer is in the post, and that therefore the agreement between the parties is complete as
soon as the acceptance is posted. But this does not explain why posting has any significance at all: any other
proof of intention to accept would equally well show that the parties were in agreement. Another suggested
reason for the rule is that the Post Office is the common agent of both parties, and that communication to this
agent immediately completes the contract. But the contents of a sealed letter cannot realistically be said to have
been communicated to the Post Office, which in any case is at most an agent to 
transmit
 
the acceptance, and
not to 
receive
 
it. It has also been suggested that the rule minimises difficulties of proof in that it is easier to
prove that a letter has been posted than that it has been received. But this depends in each case on the efficiency
with which the parties keep records of incoming and outgoing letters.
The rule is in truth an arbitrary one, little better or worse than its competitors. When negotiations are
conducted by post, one of the parties may be prejudiced if a posted acceptance is lost or delayed; for the offeree
may believe that there is a contract and the offeror that there is none, and each may act in reliance on his belief.
The posting rule favours the offeree, and is sometimes justified on the ground that an offeror who chooses to
start negotiations by post takes the risk of delay and accidents in the post; or on the ground that the offeror can
protect himself by expressly stipulating that he is not to be bound until actual receipt of the acceptance. Neither
justification is wholly satisfactory, for the negotiations may have been started by the offeree; and the offer may
be made on a form provided by the offeree, in which case he, and not the offeror, will for practical purposes be
in control of its terms. The rule does, however, serve a possibly useful function in limiting the offeror’s power to
withdraw his offer at will: it makes a posted acceptance binding although that acceptance only reaches the
offeror after a previously posted withdrawal reaches the offeree.
The strongest justification for the postal rule is the last one, namely that it places a limit
on the offeror’s power to withdraw his offer (see 
Byrne & Co
 
v. 
Van Tienhoven & Co
(1880) 5 CPD 344, 
3.4
). But even this consideration does not justify the current rule. It
would suffice for the law to conclude that, once the offeree has posted his letter of
acceptance, the offeror can no longer withdraw his offer. English law goes too far in
laying down the rule that acceptance takes place on posting. It would suffice for the law
to say that acceptance takes place when the letter of acceptance is received by, or
communicated to, the offeror but that the offeror cannot withdraw his offer once the
letter of acceptance has been posted or dispatched. This is, in fact, the position adopted
by the Vienna Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Article 23),
the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts (Article 2.1.6(2)), and the
Principles of European Contract Law. Thus Article 2:205(1) of the Principles of
European Contract Law provides that ‘if an acceptance has been dispatched by the
offeree the contract is concluded when the acceptance reaches the offeror’ while Article
2:202(1) states that ‘an offer may be revoked if the revocation reaches the offeree before
it has dispatched its acceptance … ’.
As the House of Lords made clear in 
Brinkibon Ltd
 
v. 
Stahag-Stahl und
Stahlwarenhandelsgesellschaft mbH
 
[1983] 2 AC 34 (
3.3.2
), the postal rule does not
apply to instantaneous forms of communication. As modes of communication become
quicker, the practical significance of the postal rule is likely to recede. 
Brinkibon
affirmed that the postal rule does not apply to telexes. In the case of faxes, the likelihood
is that they will not be governed by the postal rule given that, in many respects, they
resemble telexes (see 
3.3.2
). In relation to emails there is authority to support the view
that the postal rule is not applicable ‘at least where the parties are conducting the matter
by email’ (
Thomas
 
v. 
BPE Solicitors (a firm)
 
[2010] EWHC 306 (Ch), [2010] All ER (D)
306 (Feb)). The most detailed judicial consideration of the issue is to be found in the
judgment of Rajah JC in

Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd
 
[2004] 2
SLR(R) 594 in the following terms:
97.
 
Different rules may apply to e-mail transactions and worldwide web transactions. When considering the
appropriate rule to apply, it stands to reason that as between sender and receiver, the party who selects the
means of communication should bear the consequences of any unexpected events. An e-mail, while bearing
some similarity to a postal communication, is in some aspects fundamentally different. Furthermore, unlike a
fax or a telephone call, it is not instantaneous. E-mails are processed through servers, routers and Internet
service providers. Different protocols may result in messages arriving in an incomprehensible form. Arrival can
also be immaterial unless a recipient accesses the e-mail, but in this respect e-mail does not really differ from
mail that has to be opened. Certain Internet service providers provide the technology to inform a sender that a
message has not been properly routed. Others do not.
98.
 
Once an offer is sent over the Internet, the sender loses control over the route and delivery time of the
message. In that sense, it is akin to ordinary posting. Notwithstanding some real differences with posting, it
could be argued cogently that the postal rule should apply to e-mail acceptances; in other words, that the
acceptance is made the instant the offer is sent … [The] acceptance would be effective the moment the offer
enters that node of the network outside the control of the originator. There are, however, other sound reasons to
argue against such a rule in favour of the recipient rule. It should be noted that while the common law
jurisdictions continue to wrestle over this vexed issue, most civil law jurisdictions lean towards the recipient
rule. In support of the latter it might be argued that unlike a posting, e-mail communication takes place in a
relatively short time-frame. The recipient rule is therefore more convenient and relevant in the context of both
instantaneous or near instantaneous communications. Notwithstanding occasional failure, most e-mails arrive
sooner rather than later.
99.
 
Like the somewhat arbitrary selection of the postal rule for ordinary mail, in the ultimate analysis, a default
rule should be implemented for certainty, while accepting that such a rule should be applied flexibly to
minimise unjustness. In these proceedings … the parties did not address me on the issue of when the contract
was formed … In the absence of proper and full arguments on the issue of which rule is to be preferred, I do not
think it is appropriate for me to give any definitive views in these proceedings on this very important issue.
[He then referred to Article 24 of the Vienna Convention and continued]
It appears that in Convention transactions, the receipt rule applies unless there is a contrary intention. Offer
and acceptances have to ‘reach’ an intended recipient to be effective. It 
can be persuasively argued that e-mails
involving transactions embraced by the Convention are only effective on reaching the recipient. If this rule
applies to international sales, is it sensible to have a different rule for domestic sales?
101.
 
The applicable rules in relation to transactions over the worldwide web appear to be clearer and less
controversial. Transactions over websites are almost invariably instantaneous and/or interactive. The sender
will usually receive a prompt response. The recipient rule appears to be the logical default rule. Application of
such a rule may however result in contracts being formed outside the jurisdiction if not properly drafted. Web
merchants ought to ensure that they either contract out of the receipt rule or expressly insert salient terms
within the contract to deal with issues such as a choice of law, jurisdiction and other essential terms relating to
the passing of risk and payment. Failure to do so could also result in calamitous repercussions. Merchants may
find their contracts formed in foreign jurisdictions and therefore subject to foreign laws.
The proposition that the receipt rule applies to contracts concluded over the worldwide
web would seem to be correct and appears to command general assent (albeit that there
is little authority on the point). More difficult is the case of contracts concluded by
email, where Rajah JC vacillates between the different options. The balance of academic
authority supports the view that the postal rule should not apply to contracts concluded
by email and that the general rule requiring communication of the acceptance should
apply (see generally D Nolan, ‘Offer and Acceptance in the Electronic Age’ in A Burrows
and E Peel (eds), 
Contract Formation and Parties
 
(Oxford University Press, 2010), p.
61). Given that the justifications said to underpin the postal rule are weak, there seems
to be little justification for extending the rule to a further category of transactions,
namely transactions concluded by email.
An alternative explanation for the adoption of the postal rule has been provided by
Simon Gardner (‘Trashing with Trollope: A Deconstruction of the Postal Rules in
Contract’ (1992) 12 
OJLS
 
170). He seeks to place the cases in their historical context. He
notes that 1840 was the year in which the uniform penny post was introduced and that
the general perception at the time of the new postal system was that it was wonderful.
He continues (at p. 180):
This contemporary perception may have played a substantial part in the decisions in which the courts
established the acceptance rule in the 1840s. In these terms, the basis of the rule might have been not a
preference for posting over delivery as the dispositive act. It might have been an idea that delivery was self-
evidently important, but that in the newly prevailing conditions posting and delivery were little different: that
once posted, a letter was as good as delivered. But there is a certain weakness about this. Despite the great
improvements in efficiency … equating posting with delivery on purely empirical grounds would have been a
little foolish: indeed, the reason why these cases came to court at all was because the equation had failed.
However, some … other innovations added a further dimension to this constructive identification of posting
with delivery. One was a dramatic shift towards prepayment of postage. In March 1839, only 14% of letters sent
by the London General Post were prepaid, leaving 86% for which payment had to be collected from the
addressee. By February 1840 these figures had been precisely reversed. Prepayment was endorsed by none
other than Queen Victoria herself, abandoning the privilege of free use of the mail. A year later still, the unpaid
element had fallen further to 8%. A second was the further facilitation of prepayment by the 
introduction in
1840 of the self-adhesive postage stamp; another measure which entranced the public. Of the February 1841
prepaid total of 92%, 45% comprised letters for which the payment was by this means. A third important
innovation was the cutting of letter-boxes in front doors of houses, so that letters no longer needed to be handed
to their addressee; this too captured the public imagination.
Taken together, these measures may have great significance. Until 1840, the delivery of a letter typically
required that the addressee should manually receive it and pay for it. This was not, of course, a significant
practical hurdle, but it sat in symbolic contrast with the new position, whereby the sender had only to affix his
stamp and post the letter, and it would go through to its destination without further subvention from outside
the system. So these three innovations of 1840 may be seen as predicating a radically new perception of the
nature of the post: the notional equation of the posting of a letter with its delivery. They may thus have been a
very powerful influence towards the courts affirming the acceptance rule in the way that they did in that decade.
One of the attractions of this rationalization of the postal rule is that it helps to explain
the apparent lack of enthusiasm for the postal rule in cases such as 
Henthorn
 
v. 
Fraser
(discussed earlier in this section) and 
Byrne
 
v. 
van Tienhoven
 
(
3.4
) towards the end of
the nineteenth century. As Gardner notes (at p. 191):
Later decisions … have generally drifted away from the equation of posting with delivery. In terms of the
present thesis, that would be very understandable. The further one gets from the 1840 reforms, and in
particular the more one has access to instantaneous modes of communication such as became available in
1878–80 [the first telephone company began business in London in 1878], the less natural one would find that
equation. The development of additional new modes of remote communication has further discredited the old
equation of posting with delivery, and it is noticeable that cases dealing with these new technologies
increasingly marginalize the postal acceptance rule. The decisions on telex communications, for example,
explicitly treat the rule for postal acceptance as artificial, and an exception.
3.3.6
 
Acceptance in Unilateral Contracts
The rules relating to acceptance must be modified in their application to unilateral
contracts. One modification is that the courts may readily imply, as they did in 
Carlill
 
v.
Carbolic Smoke Ball Co
 
[1893] 1 QB 256 (
3.2.1
), that the offeror has waived the
requirement that the acceptance be communicated to him. But further difficulties arise.
The first relates to the identification of the act that constitutes the acceptance. The
general rule must be that the offeror is entitled to require that the offeree perform the
requested act in its entirety. A second issue relates to the time at which the offeror can
withdraw his offer. A common example cited in the books is the man who promises to
pay a sum of money if another walks from London to York. The offeror must be entitled
to insist that the other party complete the walk before he makes his claim for payment.
But at what point in time does the offeror lose his right to withdraw the offer? It seems
rather harsh to allow him to do so at any time before the other party reaches York. This
would be to enable the offeror to behave opportunistically. The better rule might be to
say that the offeror cannot withdraw his offer once performance has begun but that he is
not obliged to honour his promise to make the payment until the 
other party has fully
performed the act for which payment was promised. This was the view adopted by Goff
LJ in 
Daulia Ltd
 
v. 
Four Millbank Nominees Ltd
 
[1978] Ch 231, 239:
Whilst I think the true view of a unilateral contract must in general be that the offeror is entitled to require full
performance of the condition which he has imposed and short of that he is not bound, that must be subject to
one important qualification, which stems from the fact that there must be an implied obligation on the part of
the offeror not to prevent the condition becoming satisfied, which obligation it seems to me must arise as soon
as the offeree starts to perform. Until then the offeror can revoke the whole thing, but once the offeree has
embarked on performance it is too late for the offeror to revoke his offer.
In 
Errington
 
v. 
Errington
 
[1952] 1 KB 290 a father bought a house for his son and
daughter-in-law. The house was bought with the assistance of a mortgage. The father
told his son and daughter-in-law that the house would be theirs if they paid off the
mortgage on the house. The couple began to pay off the mortgage but were not subject to
any contractual obligation to continue to pay off the mortgage (the party who was
subject to the obligation to pay was the father). The father died before the mortgage had
been paid off. In his will he left the house to his widow and in the present action his
widow brought an action for possession of the house against the daughter-in-law. It was
held that the widow was not entitled to an order for possession. It was necessary for the
court to examine the nature of the relationship between the father and the daughter-in-
law in order to establish whether or not the daughter-in-law was entitled to remain in
possession of the house. Denning LJ analysed the nature of the relationship in the
following terms (at p. 295):
It is to be noted that the couple never bound themselves to pay the instalments to the building society, and I see
no reason why any such obligation should be implied. It is clear law that the court is not to imply a term unless
it is necessary, and I do not see that it is necessary here. Ample content is given to the whole arrangement by
holding that the father promised that the house should belong to the couple as soon as they had paid off the
mortgage. The parties did not discuss what was to happen if the couple failed to pay the instalments to the
building society, but I should have thought it clear that, if they did fail to pay the instalments, the father would
not be bound to transfer the house to them. The father’s promise was a unilateral contract—a promise of the
house in return for their act of paying the instalments. It could not be revoked by him once the couple entered
on performance of the act, but it would cease to bind him if they left it incomplete and unperformed, which they
have not done. If that was the position during the father’s lifetime, so it must be after his death. If the daughter-
in-law continues to pay all the building society instalments, the couple will be entitled to have the property
transferred to them as soon as the mortgage is paid off, but if she does not do so, then the building society will
claim the instalments from the father’s estate and the estate will have to pay them. I cannot think that in those
circumstances the estate would be bound to transfer the house to them, any more than the father himself would
have been.
3.3.7
 
Acceptance in Ignorance of an Offer
The general rule is that performance of the requested act does not amount to an
acceptance unless the party performing the act did so with knowledge of the existence of
an offer. Were it otherwise, a party could find himself bound to the terms of a contract of
which he was 
wholly unaware. The difficult case is the unilateral contract. Suppose that
a person promises to pay a reward if his lost property is returned to him. The property is
subsequently returned by someone who is unaware of the existence of the offer. Can that
person claim the reward? The point has not been authoritatively resolved by the courts
(the leading English case is probably 
Gibbons
 
v. 
Proctor
 
(1891) 64 LT 594 but the report
of that case at 55 JP 616 indicates that the party claiming the reward did have
knowledge of the offer of a reward at the time at which the relevant information was
passed on to the person named in the advertisement). While the general rule requiring
knowledge of the existence of the offer is a sound one, there is a case for making an
exception in the case of a unilateral contract, at least where performance of the act
cannot subject the performing party to any detriment. Provided that the promisor has
obtained the performance for which he promised to pay, it can be argued that the law
should impose upon him an obligation to carry out his promise and pay the promised
sum.
One further consequence of the need for knowledge of the existence of the offer is that
identical cross-offers do not, in themselves, establish the existence of a contract. In 
Tinn
v. 
Hoffman & Co
 
(1873) 29 LT 271 Blackburn J stated (at p. 279):
When a contract is made between two parties, there is a promise by one, in consideration of the promise made
by the other; there are two assenting minds, the parties agreeing in opinion, and one having promised in
consideration of the promise of the other—there is an exchange of promises; but I do not think exchanging
offers would, upon principle, be at all the same thing. … The promise or offer being made on each side in
ignorance of the promise or offer made on the other side neither of them can be construed as an acceptance of
the other. Either of the parties may write and say ‘I accept your offer, and, as you perceive, I have already made
a similar offer to you’, and then people would know what they were about, I think either side might revoke. Such
grave inconvenience would arise in mercantile business if people could doubt whether there was an acceptance
or not, that it is desirable to keep to the rule that an offer that has been made should be accepted by an
acceptance such as would leave no doubt on the matter.
More difficult is the question whether or not the act must have been done with the
intention of accepting the offer. It has been stated that ‘an act which is 
wholly
 
motivated
by factors other than the existence of the offer cannot amount to an acceptance; but if
the existence of the offer plays some part, however small, in inducing a person to do the
required act, there is a valid acceptance of the offer’ (H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on Contracts
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021), para 4-053, emphasis in the original). However, it
has been argued (in reliance upon 
Williams
 
v. 
Carwardine
 
(1833) 5 C & P 566) that
English law does not inquire into the motive of the person carrying out the act. Hence,
provided that the person was aware of the existence of the offer at the time at which he
performed the act that is alleged to constitute the acceptance, he should be held to have
accepted the offer. This is so unless it is proved affirmatively that he did not intend to
accept the offer when carrying out the particular act (see P Mitchell and J Phillips, ‘The
Contractual Nexus: Is Reliance Essential?’ (2002) 22 
OJLS
 
115).
A case which illustrates these issues is the Australian case of 
R
 
v. 
Clarke
 
(1927) 40 CLR
227. The Government of Western Australia publicly offered a reward ‘for such
information as shall lead to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons who
committed the murders’ of two police officers. The petitioner was arrested and charged
with one of the murders. He gave information that led to the arrest and conviction of
those responsible for the murders. In giving this information the petitioner was found to
be acting ‘exclusively in order to 
clear himself from a false charge of murder’. He
nevertheless brought a claim to recover the reward. His claim failed. The court held that,
in providing the information, the petitioner had not acted on or in reliance upon the
offer of a reward and so was not entitled to it. This insistence on the need for reliance
upon the offer suggests that knowledge of the existence of the offer is not enough, in
itself, to amount to acceptance of an offer. On the facts, the petitioner had seen the offer
of a reward, although it may not have been present to his mind at the time at which he
gave the information that led to the arrest and conviction of the murderers. In many
ways the crucial issue may relate to the burden of proof. Once the person who claims
that he has accepted the offer demonstrates that he knew of the offer and that he has
performed the act requested by the offeror, must he also show that he performed that
act with the intention of accepting the offer or is it for the offeror to prove that he had no
intention of accepting the offer at the time at which he performed the act? It is suggested
that the latter proposition is the correct one and that 
Clarke
 
is not inconsistent with this
proposition, because of the finding that the information was provided by the petitioner
‘exclusively’ in order to clear himself of the charge of murder. It will generally be a
difficult task for an offeror to prove that the offeree did not intend to accept the offer at
the time at which he performed the requested act. But it is not impossible, as can be
demonstrated by reference to the following hypothetical example given by Isaacs ACJ in
Clarke
 
(at p. 235):
An offer of £100 to any person who should swim a hundred yards in the harbour on the first day of the year,
would be met by voluntarily performing the feat with reference to the offer, but would not in my opinion be
satisfied by a person who was accidentally or maliciously thrown overboard on that date and swam the distance
simply to save his life, without any thought of the offer. The offeror might or might not feel morally impelled to
give the sum in such a case, but would be under no contractual obligation to do so.
3.4
 
Has the Offer Been Withdrawn or
Otherwise Terminated?
The final issue to be considered is whether or not an offer, once made, can be withdrawn
or revoked. The general rule is that an offer may be withdrawn at any time before it has
been accepted and, for this purpose, the revocation must have been communicated to
the offeree prior to his acceptance of that offer. The latter proposition is illustrated by
the following case:
BYRNE & CO V. VAN TIENHOVEN & CO
(1880) 5 CPD 344, Common Pleas Division
The defendants, who carried on business in Cardiff, offered by letter on October 1
to sell tinplate to the plaintiffs at a fixed price. The plaintiffs were in New York and
they did not receive the letter until 11 October. They immediately communicated
their acceptance by telegram. There was a surge in the price of tinplate in the first
week in October and so on 8 October the defendants sent to the plaintiffs a letter in
which they withdrew their earlier offer. This second letter was not received in New
York until 20 October. The plaintiffs sued for damages for non-delivery of the
tinplate. The defendants denied liability on a number of 
grounds, one of which was
that they had validly revoked their offer before it was accepted by the plaintiffs.
It was held that the revocation of 8 October was ineffective on that date with the
result that the plaintiffs were entitled to accept the offer on 11 October and so they
were entitled to recover damages from the defendants.
Lindley J
There is no doubt that an offer can be withdrawn before it is accepted, and it is immaterial whether the
offer is expressed to be open for acceptance for a given time or not: 
Routledge
 
v. 
Grant
 
(1828) 4 Bing.
653. For the decision of the present case, however, it is necessary to consider two other questions, viz.:
1. Whether a withdrawal of an offer has any effect until it is communicated to the person to whom the
offer has been sent? 2. Whether posting a letter of withdrawal is a communication to the person to whom
the letter is sent?
It is curious that neither of these questions appears to have been actually decided in this country. As
regards the first question, I am aware that Pothier and some other writers of celebrity are of opinion that
there can be no contract if an offer is withdrawn before it is accepted, although the withdrawal is not
communicated to the person to whom the offer has been made. The reason for this opinion is that there
is not in fact any such consent by both parties as is essential to constitute a contract between them.
Against this view, however, it has been urged that a state of mind not notified cannot be regarded in
dealings between man and man; and that an uncommunicated revocation is for all practical purposes
and in point of law no revocation at all. This is the view taken in the United States: see 
Tayloe
 
v.
Merchants Fire Insurance Co
 
9 How Sup Ct Rep cited in Benjamin on Sales, pp. 56–58, and it is
adopted by Mr Benjamin. The same view is taken by Mr Pollock in his excellent work on Principles of
Contract, edn ii., p. 10, and by Mr Leake in his Digest of the Law of Contracts, p. 43. This view,
moreover, appears to me much more in accordance with the general principles of English law than the
view maintained by Pothier. I pass, therefore, to the next question, viz., whether posting the letter of
revocation was a sufficient communication of it to the plaintiff. The offer was posted on the 1st of
October, the withdrawal was posted on the 8th, and did not reach the plaintiff until after he had posted
his letter of the 11th, accepting the offer. It may be taken as now settled that where an offer is made and
accepted by letters sent through the post, the contract is completed the moment the letter accepting the
offer is posted: 
Harris’ Case
 
(1872) LR 7 Ch 587; 
Dunlop
 
v. 
Higgins
 
(1848) 1 HLC 381, even although it
never reaches its destination. When, however, these authorities are looked at, it will be seen that they
are based upon the principle that the writer of the offer has expressly or impliedly assented to treat an
answer to him by a letter duly posted as a sufficient acceptance and notification to himself, or, in other
words, he has made the post office his agent to receive the acceptance and notification of it. But this
principle appears to me to be inapplicable to the case of the withdrawal of an offer. In this particular case
I can find no evidence of any authority in fact given by the plaintiffs to the defendants to notify a
withdrawal of their offer by merely posting a letter; and there is no legal principle or decision which
compels me to hold, contrary to the fact, that the letter of the 8th of October is to be treated as
communicated to the plaintiff on that day or on any day before the 20th, when the letter reached them.
But before that letter had reached the plaintiffs they had accepted the offer, both by telegram and by
post; and they had themselves resold the tin plates at a profit. In my opinion the withdrawal by the
defendants on the 8th of October of their offer of the 1st was inoperative; and a complete contract
binding on both parties was entered into on the 11th of October, when the plaintiffs 
accepted the offer of
the 1st, which they had no reason to suppose had been withdrawn. Before leaving this part of the case it
may be as well to point out the extreme injustice and inconvenience which any other conclusion would
produce. If the defendants’ contention were to prevail no person who had received an offer by post and
had accepted it would know his position until he had waited such a time as to be quite sure that a letter
withdrawing the offer had not been posted before his acceptance of it. It appears to me that both legal
principles, and practical convenience require that a person who has accepted an offer not known to him
to have been revoked, shall be in a position safely to act upon the footing that the offer and acceptance
constitute a contract binding on both parties.
Commentary
It should be noted that at no point in time were the parties actually in agreement. By the
time that the plaintiffs posted their letter of acceptance, the defendants had already
posted their letter of revocation.
Why is it that a letter of acceptance is effective from the moment of posting but that a
letter revoking an offer does not take effect upon posting but only upon actual
communication of the revocation to the other party? Note in this respect that the case
was decided towards the end of the nineteenth century at a time when the enthusiasm of
the courts for the postal rule appeared to be on the wane (see Gardner 
3.3.5
).
It was not necessary for Lindley J to decide the moment in time at which the revocation
was communicated to the offeree. In 
Henthorn
 
v. 
Fraser
 
[1892] 2 Ch 27, 32 Lord
Herschell cited 
Byrne
 
with approval and stated that the revocation, to be effective, must
be ‘brought to the mind of the person to whom the offer is made’. Thus the general
requirement is one of actual communication to the offeree. In the case of businesses this
general requirement may require some modification. Where a revocation of an offer is
received by a business during normal office hours, a court is likely to conclude that the
revocation takes effect from the moment in time at which, according to normal business
practice, the revocation would be read. Where the revocation is received outside
business hours, then it will not take effect until the resumption of normal business hours
(
The Brimnes
 
[1975] QB 929).
The requirement that the revocation must be communicated to the offeree gives rise to
difficulty in the case where the offer has been made to the general public. How can such
an offer be withdrawn? Article 2:202(2) of the Principles of European Contract Law
states that ‘an offer made to the public can be revoked by the same means as were used
to make the offer’. A similar conclusion was reached by the United States Supreme Court
in 
Shuey
 
v. 
United States
 
(1875) 92 US 73. A proclamation was published on 20 April
1865 offering a reward of $25,000 for the apprehension of a particular criminal. A
notice was published on 24 November 1865 revoking the offer. The plaintiff discovered
the whereabouts of the criminal in 1866 and notified the authorities. At that time the
plaintiff was unaware of the revocation of the offer. It was held that he was not entitled
to recover the reward. Strong J stated:
The offer of a reward for the apprehension of Surratt was revoked on the twenty-fourth day of November, 1865;
and notice of the revocation was published. It is not to be doubted that the offer was revocable at any time
before it was accepted, and before any thing had been done in reliance upon it. There was no contract until its
terms were complied with. Like any 
other offer of a contract, it might, therefore, be withdrawn before rights had
accrued under it; and it was withdrawn through the same channel in which it was made. The same notoriety was
given to the revocation that was given to the offer; and the findings of fact do not show that any information was
given by the claimant, or that he did any thing to entitle him to the reward offered, until five months after the
offer had been withdrawn. True, it is found that then, and at all times until the arrest was actually made, he was
ignorant of the withdrawal; but that is an immaterial fact. The offer of the reward not having been made to him
directly, but by means of a published proclamation, he should have known that it could be revoked in the
manner in which it was made.
While the revocation must have been communicated to the offeree, it need not have
been communicated by the offeror. In an appropriate case, the revocation can be
communicated to the offeree by a third party. The following case illustrates the point:
DICKINSON V. DODDS
(1876) 2 Ch D 463, Court of Appeal
On Wednesday 10 June 1974 the defendant (Dodds) sent to the plaintiff
(Dickinson) a note in which he stated:
‘I hereby agree to sell to Mr George Dickinson the whole of the dwelling-houses, garden ground, stabling
and outbuildings thereto belonging, situate at Croft, belonging to me, for the sum of £800.’
The note was signed by the defendant and it contained the following postscript:
‘This offer to be held over until Friday, 9 o’clock a.m., 12th June 1874.’ On the
following day, the plaintiff was informed by his own agent, Mr Berry, that the
defendant had offered to sell the property to another purchaser, Mr Allan. The
defendant in fact signed a formal contract to sell the land to Mr Allan on the
afternoon of 11 June for £800. The plaintiff communicated his acceptance to the
defendant on the morning of the 12th before 9 a.m. but the defendant refused to
accept it on the ground that he had already sold the property to Mr Allan. The
plaintiff brought a bill for specific performance but the action failed on the grounds
that the defendant was entitled to revoke his offer before Friday the 12th, and that
the plaintiff was aware of the revocation prior to his purported acceptance so that
his acceptance was not in fact valid and there was no contract between the
parties.
James LJ
[after referring to the document of 10 June 1874, continued]
The document, though beginning ‘I hereby agree to sell’, was nothing but an offer, and was only
intended to be an offer, for the Plaintiff himself tells us that he required time to consider whether he
would enter into an agreement or not. Unless both parties had then agreed there was no concluded
agreement then made; it was in effect and substance only an offer to sell. The Plaintiff, being minded not
to complete the bargain at that time, added this memorandum—‘This offer to be left over until Friday, 9
o’clock a.m., 12th June, 1874’. That shews it was only an offer. There was no consideration given for the
undertaking or promise, to whatever extent it may be considered binding, to keep the property unsold
until 
9 o’clock on Friday morning; but apparently Dickinson was of opinion, and probably Dodds was of
the same opinion, that he (Dodds) was bound by that promise, and could not in any way withdraw from
it, or retract it, until 9 o’clock on Friday morning, and this probably explains a good deal of what
afterwards took place. But it is clear settled law, on one of the clearest principles of law, that this
promise, being a mere nudum pactum, was not binding, and that at any moment before a complete
acceptance by Dickinson of the offer, Dodds was as free as Dickinson himself. Well, that being the state
of things, it is said that the only mode in which Dodds could assert that freedom was by actually and
distinctly saying to Dickinson, ‘Now I withdraw my offer’. It appears to me that there is neither principle
nor authority for the proposition that there must be an express and actual withdrawal of the offer, or what
is called a retraction. It must, to constitute a contract, appear that the two minds were at one, at the
same moment of time, that is, that there was an offer continuing up to the time of the acceptance. If there
was not such a continuing offer, then the acceptance comes to nothing. Of course it may well be that the
one man is bound in some way or other to let the other man know that his mind with regard to the offer
has been changed; but in this case, beyond all question, the Plaintiff knew that Dodds was no longer
minded to sell the property to him as plainly and clearly as if Dodds had told him in so many words, ‘I
withdraw the offer’. This is evident from the Plaintiff’s own statements in the bill. … It is to my mind quite
clear that before there was any attempt at acceptance by the Plaintiff, he was perfectly well aware that
Dodds had changed his mind, and that he had in fact agreed to sell the property to Allan. It is impossible,
therefore, to say there was ever that existence of the same mind between the two parties which is
essential in point of law to the making of an agreement. I am of opinion, therefore, that the Plaintiff has
failed to prove that there was any binding contract between Dodds and himself.
Mellish LJ
I am of the same opinion. … If an offer has been made for the sale of property, and before that offer is
accepted, the person who has made the offer enters into a binding agreement to sell the property to
somebody else, and the person to whom the offer was first made receives notice in some way that the
property has been sold to another person, can he after that make a binding contract by the acceptance
of the offer? I am of opinion that he cannot. The law may be right or wrong in saying that a person who
has given to another a certain time within which to accept an offer is not bound by his promise to give
that time; but, if he is not bound by that promise, and may still sell the property to some one else, and if it
be the law that, in order to make a contract, the two minds must be in agreement at some one time, that
is, at the time of the acceptance, how is it possible that when the person to whom the offer has been
made knows that the person who has made the offer has sold the property to someone else, and that, in
fact, he has not remained in the same mind to sell it to him, he can be at liberty to accept the offer and
thereby make a binding contract? It seems to me that would be simply absurd. If a man makes an offer
to sell a particular horse in his stable, and says, ‘I will give you until the day after tomorrow to accept the
offer’, and the next day goes and sells the horse to somebody else, and receives the purchase-money
from him, can the person to whom the offer was originally made then come and say, ‘I accept’, so as to
make a binding contract, and so as to be entitled to recover damages for the non-delivery of the horse?
If the rule of law is that a mere offer to sell property, which can be withdrawn at any time, and which is
made dependent on the acceptance of the person to whom it is made, is a mere nudum pactum, how is
it possible that the person to whom the offer has 
been made can by acceptance make a binding contract
after he knows that the person who has made the offer has sold the property to some one else? It is
admitted law that, if a man who makes an offer dies, the offer cannot be accepted after he is dead, and
parting with the property has very much the same effect as the death of the owner, for it makes the
performance of the offer impossible. I am clearly of opinion that, just as when a man who has made an
offer dies before it is accepted it is impossible that it can then be accepted, so when once the person to
whom the offer was made knows that the property has been sold to some one else, it is too late for him
to accept the offer, and on that ground. I am clearly of opinion that there was no binding contract for the
sale of this property by Dodds to Dickinson, and even if there had been, it seems to me that the sale of
the property to Allan was first in point of time. However, it is not necessary to consider, if there had been
two binding contracts, which of them would be entitled to priority in equity, because there is no binding
contract between Dodds and Dickinson.
Baggallay JA
 
concurred with the judgments of James and Mellish LJJ.
Commentary
Mellish LJ stated that ‘in order to make a contract, the two minds must be in agreement
at some one time, that is, at the time of the acceptance’. Taken literally this is difficult to
reconcile with the approach taken in the later case of 
Byrne & Co
 
v. 
Van Tienhoven & Co
(1880) 5 CPD 344 (earlier in this section), where there was found to be a contract
between the parties but there was no ‘one time’ at which they were in agreement. The
judgment of Mellish LJ is also open to criticism on the ground that he appears to adopt a
subjective rather than an objective approach to the existence of an agreement (on the
difference between the two approaches see further 
Chapter 2
).
The revocation was communicated to the plaintiff by a third party but was nevertheless
effective to withdraw the offer. Does notice by a third party inevitably have the effect of
revoking the offer or does this occur only where the third party is a reliable source of
information? It was not necessary for the Court of Appeal to consider this point on the
facts of 
Dickinson
 
because the information was conveyed by the plaintiff’s own agent
(who was, presumably, reliable). No clear answer can be given to this question as a
matter of authority but it is suggested that the courts ought to take account of the
reliability of the source of the information. The more reliable the source of the
information, the readier the court should be to conclude that the revocation has been
effectively communicated to the offeree.
What was the meaning of the postscript? Did Dodds mean merely that Dickinson had to
accept by Friday at the latest but that in the meantime he, Dodds, remained free to
(a)
(b)
(c)
accept any better offer that he received or did Dodds promise that he would not revoke
the offer before Friday? Does it matter which interpretation is adopted of the postscript?
Consider the following claim made by Professor Gilmore (
The Death of Contract
 
(Ohio
State University Press, 1974), p. 32):
It should be noted that the ‘restatement’ of 
Dickinson
 
v. 
Dodds
 
in terms of consideration theory makes
irrelevant what the parties may have intended by the provision that the offer should be ‘left over’ until Friday. If,
apart from the possibility of an offer under seal, all offers are revocable unless supported by what came to be
called an ‘independent’ consideration, 
then it makes no difference, absent the consideration, in what form of
language the offer may be expressed. ‘You may have until Friday to accept but I may revoke the offer at any time
before acceptance’ comes out exactly the same way as ‘You may have until Friday to accept and I also promise
that I will not revoke the offer before Friday’. Under the new dispensation the offeror is not bound by what he
has said or has intended to say or has been understood to say; he is bound if, and only if, he has received a
‘consideration’.
Dickinson
 
is therefore regarded as authority for the proposition that a promise to keep
an offer open for a particular period of time is not binding unless the offeree has
provided consideration for the promise to keep the offer open (the doctrine of
consideration is discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 5
). In this respect English law
stands out from other jurisdictions where ‘firm offers’ (as such offers are generally
known) are binding. Thus Article 2:202(3) of the Principles of European Contract Law
provides:
… a revocation of an offer is ineffective if:
the offer indicates that it is irrevocable; or
it states a fixed time for its acceptance; or
it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer as being irrevocable and the offeree has acted in
reliance on the offer.
There are other ways in which an offer can be terminated (on which see generally H
Beale (ed), 
Chitty on Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021), paras 4-113–4-142).
For example, a rejection of an offer operates to terminate the offer (see 
3.3.1
). An offer
may also come to an end as a result of the passage of time. Where the offer is stated to be
open for acceptance for a particular period of time, the expiry of that time-period will
operate to terminate the offer. Where the offer does not contain a time-limit, it will
remain open for acceptance for a reasonable period of time (provided of course that it
has not been accepted, rejected, or withdrawn in that period of time). More difficult is
the question whether or not the death of the offeror or the offeree operates to terminate
the offer. In 
Dickinson
 
v. 
Dodds
 
(extracted earlier) Mellish LJ stated that an offer cannot
be accepted in the case where the offeror dies before the offer is accepted. But his
statement does not appear to have been a considered one and he did not cite any
authority to support this proposition. His view is probably correct where the contract is
a personal one (in the sense that the identity of the parties is a crucial aspect of the
contract) but, in other cases, it is not so clear that the death of the offeror should have
the automatic effect of rendering the offer incapable of acceptance, especially in the case
where the accepting party was, at the time of the acceptance, unaware of the death of the
offeror.
3.5
 
Conclusion
The rules applied by the courts when deciding whether or not the parties have concluded
a contract are now rather complex but the complexity is due in large part to the diverse
range of factual situations to which the rules must be applied. In essence the approach
of the courts 
is first to seek out an offer and, having found it, see whether or not there
has been a matching acceptance. In practice of course the process is much more complex
as the facts of cases tend not to fit neatly into the rules that the courts have devised. The
‘battle of the forms’ cases illustrate this point. Yet the difficulty involved in
accommodating individual cases within the offer and acceptance framework has not
persuaded the judges to throw out the model and seek an alternative (see, for example,
Tekdata Interconnections Ltd
 
v. 
Amphenol Ltd
 
[2009] EWCA Civ 1209, [2010] 1 Lloyd’s
Rep 357, where Longmore LJ stated (at [11]) that ‘the traditional offer and acceptance
analysis must be adopted unless the documents passing between the parties and their
conduct show that their common intention was that some other terms were intended to
prevail’). It is true that Lord Denning did once state that the offer and acceptance
approach was ‘out-of-date’ but he failed to persuade his colleagues of the merits of his
view. Rather than abandon the offer and acceptance analysis in its entirety, the courts
have chosen to apply it with a degree of flexibility to the facts of individual cases (as can
be seen from cases such as 
Butler
 
v. 
Ex-Cell-O Corporation
 
(
3.3.1
) and 
Blackpool and
Fylde Aero Club Ltd
 
v. 
Blackpool Borough Council
 
(
3.2.3
)).
Finally, it is important to resist the conclusion that the rules of offer and acceptance are
rules that are mechanically developed and applied by the courts. For example, there is
no obvious answer to the question of the time at which an acceptance sent through the
post should take effect. The court must consider the relative advantages and
disadvantages of the different options and make its choice. The English courts have
chosen the time of posting and not the time of receipt and, as we have seen, this choice
has not been universally approved. The initial choice of the rule is not a value-free
exercise, even if the application of that rule in subsequent cases can appear to be rather
mechanical.

Uncertain and Incomplete Agreements
Central Issues
The courts will not generally make the contract for the parties. It is for
the parties to make their contract and they must express their
agreement in a form that is sufficiently certain for the courts to be able
to enforce it.
The courts have experienced considerable difficulty in the cases in
deciding whether or not an agreement has been expressed in a form
that is sufficiently certain for them to enforce. On the one hand, the
judges generally do not wish to be seen to be making the contract for
the parties. On the other hand, they are reluctant to deny legal effect to
an agreement that the parties have apparently accepted as valid and
binding. The result has been a degree of tension in the case-law. This
is particularly so in relation to ‘agreements to agree’. The view taken
by the House of Lords in a case decided more than eighty years ago is
that an agreement to agree is not enforceable. However, courts in
other jurisdictions have recognized the validity of such agreements
and many commentators and commercial practitioners have argued
that English law should now do so as well. The competing views in
this debate are considered in this chapter.
An agreement is less likely to be held to be too vague or too uncertain
where it contains within it criteria or machinery that the court can use
in order to resolve the uncertainty or to clarify the word or phrase that
is expressed in vague terms. For example, the agreement can provide
that the uncertainty or doubt is to be resolved by one of the
contracting parties or by a third party (provided that the third party is
not a judge sitting in a court of law). The court may also be able to
imply a term into the agreement in order to fill the gap that was left by
the parties or it may be able to cut out (or ‘sever’) the term that is
alleged to be too uncertain or too vague and enforce the rest of the
agreement.
4.1
 
Introduction
It sometimes happens that parties to agreements express themselves in terms that are
vague, incomplete, or uncertain. Does an agreement expressed in such terms amount to
an enforceable contract? This question does not admit of an easy answer, largely
because it cannot be answered in black and white terms. A great deal depends on the
facts of the individual case. Further, the question which the courts ask themselves is
whether or not the agreement is ‘sufficiently certain’ to be enforced and sufficiency
involves questions of degree. The result has been a degree of inconsistency in the case-
law, with some judges appearing to be more willing than others to find the existence of a
contract notwithstanding the fact that the agreement between the parties was expressed
in terms that were in some way vague, incomplete, or uncertain.
The tension in the case-law can be easily stated, if not easily resolved. On the one hand,
the courts insist that it is not their function to make the contract for the parties. It is for
the parties to make the contract, and the task of the courts is simply to interpret the
contract and, where necessary, enforce it or grant remedies for its breach. On the other
hand, the courts do not wish to incur the reproach of the commercial community by
denying legal effect to an agreement that has been reached by commercial parties, was
regarded by them as a binding agreement, and, possibly, had been acted upon over a
period of time. This tension is particularly acute where the parties expressly recognize
that they have not reached agreement on a particular issue but have reached agreement
on a number of other points. In such a case should a court conclude that the agreement
is not enforceable on the ground that the parties have failed to reach agreement or on
the ground that it is not the function of the court to make the agreement for the parties?
Or should the court nevertheless give legal effect to the agreement concluded between
the parties even though it was expressed in the form of an agreement to reach an
agreement? An example will illustrate the point. Clause 1 of the contract between the
parties in 
Foley
 
v. 
Classique Coaches Ltd
 
[1934] 2 KB 1 provided as follows:
The vendor shall sell to the company and the company shall purchase from the vendor all petrol which shall be
required by the company for the running of their said business at a price to be agreed by the parties in writing
and from time to time.
A dispute broke out between the parties and one of the issues between them was
whether or not the agreement to supply petrol to the purchasers was valid and binding
despite their failure to reach agreement on the price at which the petrol was to be sold.
The purchasers argued that it was not binding. They submitted that the parties had
failed to reach agreement on the price and it was not the function of the courts to make
the contract for the parties. The vendors, on the other hand, relied on the fact that the
parties had acted on the basis of this agreement for three years and the fact that the
agreement contained an arbitration clause which covered a failure to agree the price at
which the petrol was to be sold. The Court of Appeal came down on the side of the
vendors and held that the agreement was valid and binding. Greer LJ stated (at p. 11)
that, ‘in order to give effect to what both parties intended the Court is justified in
implying that in the absence of agreement as to price a reasonable price must be paid,
and if the parties cannot agree as to what is a reasonable price then arbitration must
take place’.
The task of the Court of Appeal in 
Foley
 
was made more difficult by the fact that, in the
words of Scrutton LJ (at p. 9), ‘a good deal of the case turns upon the effect of two
decisions 
of the House of Lords which are not easy to fit in with each other’. The first of
these decisions is 
May and Butcher Ltd
 
v. 
The King
 
[1934] 2 KB 17n, a case decided in
1929 but not reported until 1934, while the second is 
Hillas & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Arcos Ltd
 
(1932)
147 LT 503. These two cases remain leading cases and their relationship is an uneasy
one. It is therefore important to commence our analysis by considering these two cases
and their relationship with each other.
MAY AND BUTCHER LTD V. THE KING
[1934] 2 KB 17n, House of Lords
May and Butcher Ltd, the suppliants
 
(also referred to in the judgments as the
appellants), alleged that they had concluded an agreement with the Controller of
the Disposals Board under which they agreed to buy the whole of the tentage
which might become available in the United Kingdom for disposal up to 31 March
1923. On 29 June 1921, the Controller wrote to the suppliants stating that:
‘in consideration of your agreeing to deposit with the [Disposals & Liquidation] Commission the sum of
1000l. as security for the carrying out of this extended contract, the Commission hereby confirm the sale
to you of the whole of the old tentage which may become available … up to and including December 31,
1
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
1921, upon the following terms:
The Commission agrees to sell and [the suppliants] agree to purchase the total stock of old
tentage …
The price or prices to be paid, and the date or dates on which payment is to be made by the
purchasers to the Commission for such old tentage shall be agreed upon from time to time
between the Commission and the purchasers as the quantities of the said old tentage become
available for disposal, and are offered to the purchasers by the Commission.
Delivery … shall be taken by the purchasers in such period or periods as may be agreed upon
between the Commission and the purchasers when such quantities of old tentage are offered to
the purchasers by the Commission. …
It is understood that all disputes with reference to or arising out of this agreement will be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1889.’
In a second letter, dated 7 January 1922, the Disposals Controller confirmed the
sale to the suppliants of the tentage that might become available for disposal up to
31 March 1923. This letter, which varied in certain respects the earlier terms,
stated that ‘the prices to be agreed upon between the Commission and the
purchasers in accordance with the terms of clause 3 of the said earlier contract
shall include delivery free on rail … nearest to the depots at which the said tentage
may be lying …’.
In August 1922, after the suppliants had made proposals to purchase tentage
that were not acceptable to the Controller, the Disposals Board wrote to the
suppliants and stated that they considered themselves no longer bound by the
agreement. The suppliants then filed their petition of right in which they claimed (i)
an injunction restraining the Commission from disposing of the remainder of the
tentage to anyone other than the suppliants, and (ii) an account of the tentage that
had become available and compensation for the damage done to them. Their
petition was dismissed by the House of Lords.
Lord Buckmaster
The points that arise for determination are these: Whether or not the terms of the contract were
sufficiently defined to constitute a legal binding contract between the parties. The Crown says that the
price was never agreed. The suppliants say first, that if it was not agreed, it would be a reasonable price.
Secondly, they say that even if the price was not agreed, the arbitration clause in the contract was
intended to cover this very question of price, and that consequently the reasonableness of the price was
referred to arbitration under the contract …
My Lords, those being the contentions, it is obvious that the whole matter depends upon the
construction of the actual words of the bargain itself.
[He set out various terms of the correspondence that had passed between the parties and continued]
What resulted was this: it was impossible to agree the prices, and unless the appellants are in a
position to establish either that this failure to agree resulted out of a definite agreement to buy at a
reasonable price, or that the price had become subject to arbitration, it is plain on the first two points
which have been mentioned that this appeal must fail.
In my opinion there never was a concluded contract between the parties. It has long been a well
recognized principle of contract law that an agreement between two parties to enter into an agreement in
which some critical part of the contract matter is left undetermined is no contract at all. It is of course
perfectly possible for two people to contract that they will sign a document which contains all the relevant
terms, but it is not open to them to agree that they will in the future agree upon a matter which is vital to
the arrangement between them and has not yet been determined. It has been argued that as the fixing
of the price has broken down, a reasonable price must be assumed. That depends in part upon the
terms of the Sale of Goods Act, which no doubt reproduces, and is known to have reproduced, the old
law upon the matter. That provides in s. 8 that ‘the price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the
contract, or may be left to be fixed in manner thereby agreed, or may be determined by the course of
dealing between the parties. Where the price is not determined in accordance with the foregoing
provisions the buyer must pay a reasonable price’; while, if the agreement is to sell goods on the terms
that the price is to be fixed by the valuation of a third party, and such third party cannot or does not make
such valuation, s. 9 says that the agreement is avoided. I find myself quite unable to understand the
distinction between an agreement to permit the price to be fixed by a third party and an agreement to
permit the price to be fixed in the future by the two parties to the contract themselves. In principle it
appears to me that they are one and the same thing …
The next question is about the arbitration clause, and there I entirely agree with the majority of the
Court of Appeal and also with Rowlatt J. The clause refers ‘disputes with reference to or arising out of
this agreement’ to arbitration, but until the price has been fixed, the agreement is not there. The
arbitration clause relates to the settlement of whatever may happen when the agreement has been
completed and the parties are regularly bound. There is nothing in the arbitration clause to enable a
contract to be made which in fact the original bargain has left quite open.
Viscount Dunedin
I am of the same opinion. This case arises upon a question of sale, but in my view the principles which
we are applying are not confined to sale, but are the general principles of the law of contract. To be a
good contract there must be a concluded bargain, and a concluded contract is one which settles
everything that is necessary to be settled and leaves nothing to be settled by agreement between the
parties. Of course it may leave something which still 
has to be determined, but then that determination
must be a determination which does not depend upon the agreement between the parties. In the system
of law in which I was brought up,
 
that was expressed by one of those brocards of which perhaps we
have been too fond, but which often express very neatly what is wanted: ‘Certum est quod certum reddi
potest’.
 
Therefore, you may very well agree that a certain part of the contract of sale, such as price,
may be settled by some one else. As a matter of the general law of contract all the essentials have to be
settled. What are the essentials may vary according to the particular contract under consideration. We
are here dealing with sale, and undoubtedly price is one of the essentials of sale, and if it is left still to be
agreed between the parties, then there is no contract. It may be left to the determination of a certain
person, and if it was so left and that person either would not or could not act, there would be no contract
because the price was to be settled in a certain way and it has become impossible to settle it in that way,
and therefore there is no settlement. No doubt as to goods, the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, says that if the
2
3
price is not mentioned and settled in the contract it is to be a reasonable price. The simple answer in this
case is that the Sale of Goods Act provides for silence on the point and here there is no silence, because
there is a provision that the two parties are to agree. As long as you have something certain it does not
matter. For instance, with regard to price it is a perfectly good contract to say that the price is to be
settled by the buyer. I have not had time, or perhaps I have not been industrious enough, to look through
all the books in England to see if there is such a case; but there was such a case in Scotland in 1760,
where it was decided that a sale of a landed estate was perfectly good, the price being left to be settled
by the buyer himself. I have only expressed in other words what has already been said by my noble
friend on the Woolsack. Here there was clearly no contract. There would have been a perfectly good
settlement of price if the contract had said that it was to be settled by arbitration by a certain man, or it
might have been quite good if it was said that it was to be settled by arbitration under the Arbitration Act
so as to bring in a material plan by which a certain person could be put in action. The question then
arises, has anything of that sort been done? I think clearly not. The general arbitration clause is one in
very common form as to disputes arising out of the arrangements. In no proper meaning of the word can
this be described as a dispute arising between the parties; it is a failure to agree, which is a very different
thing from a dispute.
Lord Warrington of Clyffe
 
delivered a concurring judgment.
HILLAS & CO LTD V. ARCOS LTD
(1932) 147 LT 503, House of Lords
By an agreement dated 21 May 1930 the appellants agreed to buy from the
respondents ‘22,000 standards of softwood goods of fair specification over the
season 1930’ subject to a number of conditions, one of which, clause 9, was in the
following terms:
‘Buyers shall also have the option of entering into a contract with sellers for the purchase of 100,000
standards for delivery during 1931. Such contract to stipulate that, whatever the conditions are, buyers
shall obtain the goods on conditions and at prices which show to them a reduction of 5%. on the f.o.b.
value of the official price list at any time ruling during 1931. Such option to be declared before the 1st
Jan. 1931.’
The appellants purported to exercise the option on 22 December 1930 but the
respondents had already agreed to sell the whole of the output of the 1931 season
to a third party. The appellants sued for damages for breach of contract but were
met by the defence that the document of 21 May 1930 did not constitute an
enforceable agreement because it did not contain a sufficient description of the
goods to be sold to enable them to be identified and it contemplated in the future
some further agreement upon essential terms. The House of Lords rejected the
defence and held that, the option having been exercised, the agreement was
complete and binding in itself and was not dependent on any future agreement for
its validity.
Lord Tomlin
In the present case one or two preliminary observations fall to be made.
First, the parties were both intimately acquainted with the course of business in the Russian softwood
timber trade, and had without difficulty carried out the sale and purchase of 22,000 standards under the
first part of the document of the 21st May 1930;
Secondly, although the question here is whether Clause 9 of the document of the 21st May 1930,
with the letter of 22nd Dec. 1930, constitutes a contract, the validity of the whole of the document of the
21st May 1930 is really in question so far as the matter depends upon the meaning of the phrase ‘of fair
specification’; and,
Thirdly, it is indisputable, having regard to clause 11, which provides that ‘this agreement cancels all
previous agreements’, that the parties intended by the document of 21st May 1930 to make, and
believed that they had made, some concluded bargain.
The case against the appellants is put on two grounds.
First, it is said that there is in Clause 9 no sufficient description of the goods to be sold; and
Secondly, it is said that clause 9 contemplates a future bargain the terms of which remain to be
settled.
As to the first point it is plain that something must necessarily be implied in clause 9. The words ‘100,000
standards’ without more do not even indicate that timber is the subject matter of the clause. The
implication at the least of the words ‘of softwood goods’ is in my opinion inevitable, and if this is so I see
no reason to separate the words ‘of fair specification’ from the words ‘of softwood goods’. In my opinion,
there is a necessary implication of the words ‘of softwood goods of fair specification’ after the words
‘100,000 standards’ in clause 9.
What, then, is the meaning of ‘100,000 standards of softwood goods of fair specification for delivery
during 1931’?
If the words ‘of fair specification’ have no meaning which is certain or capable of being made certain,
then not only can there be no contract under clause 9 but there cannot have been a contract with regard
to the 22,000 standards mentioned at the beginning of the document of the 21st May 1930. This may be
the proper conclusion, but before it is reached it is, I think, necessary to exclude as impossible all
reasonable meanings which would give certainty to the words. In my opinion, this cannot be done.
The parties undoubtedly attributed to the words in connection with the 22,000 standards, some
meaning which was precise or capable of being made precise …
Reading the document of 21st May 1930 as a whole, and having regard to the admissible evidence
as to the course of the trade, I think that upon their true construction the words ‘of fair specification over
the season 1930,’ used in connection with the 22,000 standards, mean that the 22,000 standards are to
be satisfied in goods distributed over kinds, qualities and sizes in the fair proportions, having regard to
the output of the season 1930 and the 
classifications of that output in respect of kinds, qualities and
sizes. That is something which if the parties fail to agree can be ascertained just as much as the fair
value of a property.
I have already expressed the view that clause 9 must be read as ‘100,000 standards of fair
specification for delivery during 1931,’ and these words, I think, have the same meaning, 
mutatis
mutandis
,
 
as the words relating to the 22,000 standards. Thus, there is a description of the goods which
if not immediately yet ultimately is capable of being rendered certain.
The second point upon clause 9, that it contemplates a future agreement, remains to be considered.
The form of the phrases ‘the option of entering into a contract’ and ‘such contract to stipulate that’
upon which stress has been laid by the respondents seems to me unimportant. These phrases are but
an inartificial way of indicating that there is no contract till the option is exercised. The sentence that such
contract is to stipulate that whatever the conditions are the buyers are to obtain the goods at a certain
reduction is more difficult. The words ‘whatever the conditions are’ being governed by the word ‘that’
which follows the words ‘to stipulate’ must be intended to be part of the contract. If so the word
‘conditions’ cannot mean terms of the contract, but must connote some extrinsic condition of affairs, and
the condition of affairs referred to is, I think, the conditions as to supply and demand which may prevail
during 1931.
Upon this view of the matter it cannot, I think, be said that there is nothing more than an agreement
to make an agreement.
It is also urged as a minor point that there was no provision as to shipment, and that this was an
essential of such a contract. I am not prepared without further consideration to accept the view that in
the absence of a provision in relation to shipment there can be no contract in law in such a case as the
present.
In my opinion, however, the point does not arise here. Clause 9 is one of the clauses containing the
conditions upon which the sale of the 22,000 standards is made. This fact, together with the presence of
the word ‘also’ in clause 9, satisfies me that upon the true construction of the document the sale
conditions in relation to the 22,000 standards are so far as applicable imported into the option for the
sale of this 100,000 standards, and in particular that clause 6, relating to shipping dates and loading
instructions, is so imported.
Reference was made in the course of the arguments before your Lordships and in the judgments in
the Court of Appeal to the unreported
 
case before your Lordships’ House of 
May & Butcher, Ltd
 
v. 
Rex
.
In the agreement there under consideration there was an express provision that the price of the
goods to be sold should be subsequently fixed between the parties. Your Lordships’ House reached the
conclusion that there was no contract, rejecting the appellants’ contention that the agreement should be
construed as an agreement to sell at the fair or reasonable price or alternatively at a price to be fixed
under the arbitration clause contained in the agreement.
That case does not, in my opinion, afford any assistance in determining the present case, the result
of which must depend upon the meaning placed upon the language employed …
Lord Wright
The document of the 21st May 1930 cannot be regarded as other than inartistic, and may appear
repellent to the trained sense of an equity draftsman. But it is clear that the parties both intended to
make a contract and thought they had done so. Business men often record 
the most important
4
5
agreements in crude and summary fashion; modes of expression sufficient and clear to them in the
course of their business may appear to those unfamiliar with the business far from complete or precise.
It is accordingly the duty of the court to construe such documents fairly and broadly, without being too
astute or subtle in finding defects, but, on the contrary, the court should seek to apply the old maxim of
English law 
verba ita sunt intelligenda ut res magis valeat quam pereat
.
 
That maxim, however, does not
mean that the Court is to make a contract for the parties, or to go outside the words they have used,
except in so far as there are appropriate implications of law, as, for instance, the implication of what is
just and reasonable to be ascertained by the court as a matter of machinery where the contractual
intention is clear but the contract is silent on some detail. Thus, in contracts for future performance over
a period the parties may neither be able nor desire to specify many matters of detail, but leave them to
be adjusted in the working out of the contract. Save for the legal implication I have mentioned, such
contracts might well be incomplete or uncertain; with that implication in reserve they are neither
incomplete nor uncertain. As obvious illustrations I may refer to such matters as prices or times of
delivery in contracts for the sale of goods, or times for loading or discharging in a contract of sea
carriage. Furthermore, even if the construction of the words used may be difficult, that is not a reason for
holding them too ambiguous or uncertain to be enforced, if the fair meaning of the parties can be
extracted.
[Lord Wright proceeded to consider the construction of the words used in some detail and concluded]
In the result, I arrive at the same conclusion as MacKinnon, J, viz., that the contract is valid and
enforceable and that the appellants are entitled to recover damages from the respondents for its
repudiation.

Commentary
The spirit of the judgments in 
Hillas
 
appears to stand in marked contrast to the tenor of
the judgments in 
May and Butcher
. The modern perception tends to be that the House
of Lords in 
May and Butcher
 
adopted an unduly restrictive approach and that it should
be kept within narrow confines, if not overruled. This sentiment was expressed by
Blanchard J, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, in 
Fletcher
Challenge Energy Ltd
 
v. 
Electricity Corporation of New Zealand Ltd
 
[2002] 2 NZLR
433. He stated (at pp. 446–447):
Something should be said about the place that the controversial decision of the House of Lords in 
May and
Butcher Ltd
 
v. 
The King
 
[1934] 2 KB 17n has in the modern law of contract. We take the view that this case is no
longer to be regarded as authority for any wider proposition than that an ‘agreement’ which omits an essential
term (or, as Lord Buckmaster called it, ‘a critical part’), or a means of determining such a term does not amount
to a contract. No longer should it be said, on the basis of that case, that 
prima facie
, if something essential is left
6
to be agreed upon by the parties at a later time, there is no binding agreement. The intention of the parties, as
discerned by the Court, to be bound or not to be bound should be paramount. If the Court is satisfied that the
parties intended to be bound, it will strive to find a means of giving effect to that intention by filling the gap. On
the other hand, if the Court takes the view that the parties did not intend to be bound unless they themselves
filled the gap (that they were not content to leave that task to the Court or a third party), then the agreement
will not be binding.
On its own facts we respectfully doubt that 
May and Butcher
 
would be decided by their Lordships in the
same way today. We are now perhaps more accustomed to resort to arbitration in order to settle matters of
considerable importance to the contracting parties. We find curious the notion that, in a commercial contract
where price is left to be agreed, a reasonable price cannot be fixed and that, even where there is an arbitration
clause, that clause cannot be used to determine the price because ‘unless the price has been fixed, the agreement
is not there’.
We agree with Professor McLauchlan (‘Rethinking Agreements to Agree’ (1998) 18 
NZULR
 
77, 85) that ‘an
agreement to agree will not be held void for uncertainty if the parties have provided a workable formula or
objective standard or a machinery (such as arbitration) for determining the matter which has been left open’.
We also agree with him that the court can step in and apply the formula or standard if the parties fail to agree or
can substitute other machinery if the designated machinery breaks down.
One feature of this passage from the judgment of Blanchard J is the emphasis that it
places upon the issue of whether or not the parties intended to be bound by the
agreement they have concluded (on which see further 
7.4.2
). In other words, instead of
asking the question whether or not the agreement reached by the parties was sufficiently
certain to constitute an enforceable contract, the court should ask itself whether or not
the parties intended to be bound by their agreement. In this way lack of certainty ceases
to be a distinct issue in itself and instead is subsumed within a wider inquiry as to the
intention of the parties. The difficulty with the latter approach is its lack of precision and
this may itself give rise to uncertainty!
But it does at least point in the right direction, in the sense that where the parties did,
objectively, intend to be bound and performance has taken place, the courts are much
more likely to conclude that the parties have entered into a legally binding contract. An
illustration is provided by the recent decision of the Supreme Court in 
Wells
 
v. 
Devani
[2019] UKSC 4, [2020] AC 129. The defendant developer, who was having some
difficulty selling some properties, was put in contact with the claimant estate agent.
During the course of a telephone conversation the claimant stated that his standard fees
were 2 per cent plus VAT, but no express mention was made of the circumstance that
would trigger the obligation to pay the fee. The claimant then contacted a housing
association who agreed, subject to contract, to buy the properties and the sale of the
properties was subsequently completed. The defendant denied that the parties had
entered into a contract because of their failure to agree the point in time at which the
commission was to be paid. The Court of Appeal held that no contract had been
concluded for this reason but their finding was overturned on appeal to the Supreme
Court. The leading judgment was given by Lord Kitchin who stated:
18.
 
It may be the case that the words and conduct relied upon are so vague and lacking in specificity that the
court is unable to identify the terms on which the parties have reached agreement or to attribute to the parties
any contractual intention. But the courts are reluctant to find an agreement is too vague or uncertain to be
enforced where it is found that the parties had the intention of being contractually bound and have acted on
their agreement. …
19
 
It is true that, as the judge found, there was no discussion of the precise event which would give rise to the
payment of that commission but, absent a provision to the contrary, I have no doubt it would naturally be
understood that payment would become due on completion and made from the proceeds of sale. Indeed, it
seems to me that is the only sensible interpretation of what they said to each other in the course of their
telephone conversation … and the circumstances in which that conversation took place. In short, Mr Devani
[the claimant] and Mr Wells [the defendant] agreed that if Mr Devani found a purchaser for the flats he would
be paid his commission. He found Newlon [the housing association] and it became the purchaser on completion
of the transaction. At that point, Mr Devani became entitled to his commission and it was payable from the
proceeds of sale.
In many ways 
Wells
 
should have been a clear-cut case, given that the transaction had
proceeded through to completion and the choice of the date of completion as the trigger
date for payment when payment would be made out of the proceeds of the sale protected
the legitimate interests of the defendant (which might not have happened had the earlier
date of exchange been identified as the trigger date). However, it proved not to be a
straightforward case because it was necessary to take the case all the way up to the
Supreme Court in order to overturn the decision of the Court of Appeal that no contract
had been concluded.
The reality appears to be that judges do find it difficult to know where to draw the line.
As an illustration of the difficulties involved it is instructive to examine the judgment of
Scrutton LJ in the Court of Appeal in 
Hillas
. Scrutton LJ had also been one of the judges
in the Court of Appeal in 
May and Butcher
 
where, in a dissenting judgment, he had
expressed the view that the agreement between the parties was enforceable. He returned
to this issue in his judgment in 
Hillas
 
(at p. 506) in the following terms:
I am afraid I remain quite impenitent. I think it was right and that nine out of ten business men would agree
with me. But of course I recognise that I am bound as a judge to follow the principles laid down by the House of
Lords. But I regret that in many commercial matters the English law and the practice of commercial men are
getting wider apart, with the result that commercial business is leaving the courts and is being decided by
commercial arbitrators with infrequent reference to the courts. … The commercial man does not think there can
be no contract to make a contract when every day he finds a policy ‘premium to be agreed’ treated by the law as
a contract.
The force with which this view was expressed might lead us to believe that he would
have upheld the validity of the agreement in 
Hillas
. But this is not in fact the case. In his
view, the agreement was not enforceable. He stated (at p. 506):
In my view, 
apart from authority
, considering the number of things left undetermined, kinds, sizes and
quantities of goods, times and ports and manner of shipment, as will be seen from the detailed terms in
contracts which were agreed, but which had in this case to be determined by agreement after negotiation, the
option clause was not an agreement, but … ‘an agreement to make an agreement’ which is not an enforceable
agreement. [Emphasis added.]
Thus Scrutton LJ thought that the agreement in 
May and Butcher
 
was enforceable but
that the agreement in 
Hillas
 
was not, whereas the House of Lords adopted the opposite
view in both cases. This difference of view serves to illustrate the problem of distilling
clear and coherent principles from the case-law. Professor Macneil has described the
attempt to find ‘coherent principles’ in the agreement to agree cases as ‘a fool’s errand’
(Macneil in ‘Biographical Statement’ in D Campbell (ed), 
The Relational Theory of
Contract: Selected Works of Ian Macneil
 
(Sweet & Maxwell, 2001)). In this respect he is
probably right. Much will depend on the facts of the individual case (a point emphasized
by Rix LJ in 
Mamidoil-Jetoil Greek Petroleum Company SA
 
v. 
Okta Crude Oil Refinery
AD
 
[2001] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 76, [69]). The parties are unlikely to have reached agreement
on every single matter and so the court must decide in each case whether there is
sufficient
 
evidence of agreement to enable it to reach the conclusion that the agreement
is valid and binding. If they have failed to reach agreement on what the court deems to
be an essential term of the contract, the court may conclude that the parties have not in
fact entered into a legally binding contract (as demonstrated by cases such as 
Teekay
Tankers Ltd
 
v. 
STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co Ltd
 
[2017] EWHC 253 (Comm), [2017]
1 Lloyd’s Rep 387), or that the particular term sought to be enforced is no more than an
agreement to agree and so is unenforceable (
Morris
 
v. 
Swanton Care & Community Ltd
[2018] EWCA Civ 2763). On the other hand, while this inquiry is in many respects fact-
specific, it is nevertheless possible to identify some factors that are taken into account by
the courts in deciding whether or not an agreement is valid and enforceable (see, for
example, the judgment of Rix LJ in 
Mamidoil-Jetoil Greek Petroleum Company SA
 
v.
Okta Crude Oil Refinery AD
 
[2001] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 76, [69] and the judgment of
Chadwick LJ in 
BJ Aviation Ltd
 
v. 
Pool Aviation Ltd
 
[2002] 2 P & CR 25, [19]–[24]).
The cases will now be divided into two groups. The first group consists of cases in which
it was held that the agreement was too uncertain or too vague to be enforced, while the
second group comprises a number of cases in which the courts have concluded that the
agreement was valid and binding.

Cases in Which it Has Been Held that the
Agreement is too Vague or Uncertain to Be
Enforced
The leading case in this category is undoubtedly the decision of the House of Lords in
May and Butcher
 
v. 
The King
 
(discussed earlier). But there are other examples. It
suffices for our purposes to provide one further illustration.
SCAMMELL AND NEPHEW LTD V. OUSTON
[1941] AC 251, House of Lords
The defendants (appellants) wrote to the plaintiffs (respondents) and offered to sell
them a Commer van for £268 and to take the plaintiffs’ Bedford van in part
exchange, allowing them the sum of £100 for the Bedford van. The parties agreed
these terms at an interview. The following day the defendants wrote to the plaintiffs
and asked them to place the official order for the van in order to enable them to
complete their records. The plaintiffs accordingly wrote to the defendants and the
letter included the following sentence: ‘this order is given 
on the understanding that
the balance of the purchase price can be had on hire-purchase terms over a period
of 2 years.’ This sentence reflected the plaintiffs’ position throughout the
negotiations, namely that they could only purchase the van on hire-purchase
terms. The relationship between the parties then deteriorated, principally as a
result of a disagreement about the condition of the Bedford van that led the
defendants to refuse to take it in part-exchange. The plaintiffs claimed that this
amounted to a breach of contract and brought a claim for damages. The
defendants denied any liability on the ground that no contract had in fact been
concluded between the parties. The defence failed at first instance and in the Court
of Appeal but succeeded in the House of Lords where it was held that the words
‘on hire-purchase terms’ could not be given any definite meaning so that the
parties had not, in fact, concluded a contract.
Viscount Maugham
My Lords, I have had the advantage of reading the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Russell
of Killowen. I entirely agree with it and with his statement of the relevant facts. No less, however, than
four judges have come to a different conclusion, and they think that the respondents have succeeded in
establishing a contract in this case. I should always be slow to differ from views of those for whom I
entertain a very genuine respect, if I could entertain any real doubt about the matter. I am constrained
therefore to add some remarks of my own to explain why I am led to an opinion which coincides with that
of my noble friend.
It is a regrettable fact that there are few, if any, topics on which there seems to be a greater difference
of judicial opinion than those which relate to the question whether as the result of informal letters or like
documents a binding contract has been arrived at. Many well-known instances are to be found in the
books, the last being that of 
Hillas & Co
 
v. 
Arcos, Ltd
 
(1932) 147 LT 503. The reason for these different
conclusions is that laymen unassisted by persons with a legal training are not always accustomed to use
words or phrases with a precise or definite meaning. In order to constitute a valid contract the parties
must so express themselves that their meaning can be determined with a reasonable degree of
certainty. It is plain that unless this can be done it would be impossible to hold that the contracting parties
had the same intention; in other words the consensus ad idem would be a matter of mere conjecture.
This general rule, however, applies somewhat differently in different cases. In commercial documents
connected with dealings in a trade with which the parties are perfectly familiar the court is very willing, if
satisfied that the parties thought that they made a binding contract, to imply terms and in particular terms
as to the method of carrying out the contract which it would be impossible to supply in other kinds of
contract: see 
Hillas & Co
 
v. 
Arcos, Ltd
 
…
We come then to the question as to the effect of the (so-called) purchase being on ‘hire-purchase
terms’, and here we are confronted with a strange and confusing circumstance. The term ‘hire-purchase’
for a good many years past has been understood to mean a contract of hire by the owner of a chattel
conferring on the hirer an option to purchase on the performance of certain conditions: 
Helby
 
v.
Matthews
 
[1895] AC 471. There is in these contracts—and this is from a business standpoint a most
important matter—no agreement to buy within the Factors Act, 1889, or the Sale of Goods Act, 1893;
there is only an option and the hirer can confer on a purchaser from him no better title than he himself
has, except in the case of sale in market overt. It is inaccurate and misleading to add to an order for
goods, as if given by a purchaser, a clause that hire-purchase terms are to apply, without something to
explain the apparent contradiction. Moreover a hire-purchase agreement may assume many forms and
some of the variations in those forms are of the most important character, e.g., those which relate to
termination of the agreement, warranty of fitness, duties as to repair, interest, and so forth.
Bearing these facts in mind, what do the words as to ‘hire-purchase terms’ mean in the present case?
They may indicate that the hire-purchase agreement was to be granted by the appellants or on the other
hand by some finance company acting in collaboration with the appellants; they may contemplate that
the appellants were to receive by instalments a sum of £168 spread over a period of two years upon
delivering the new van and receiving the old car, or, on the other hand, that the appellants were to
receive from a third party a lump sum of £168 and that the third party, presumably a finance company,
was to receive from the respondents a larger sum than £168 to include interest and profit spread over a
period of two years. Moreover, nothing is said (except as to the two years period) as to the terms of the
hire-purchase agreement, for instance, as to the interest payable, and as to the rights of the letter
whoever he may be in the event of default by the respondents in payment of the instalments at the due
dates. As regards the last matters there was no evidence to suggest that there are any well-known ‘usual
terms’ in such a contract; and I think it is common knowledge that in fact many letters though by no
means all of them insist on terms which the legislature regards as so unfair and unconscionable that it
was recently found necessary to deal with the matter in the recent Act entitled the Hire-Purchase Act,
1938.
These, my Lords, are very serious difficulties, and when we find as we do in this curious case that the
trial judge and the three Lords Justices, and even the two counsel who addressed your Lordships for the
respondents, were unable to agree upon the true construction of the alleged agreement, it seems to me
that it is impossible to conclude that a binding agreement has been established by the respondents.
The appeal must, I think, succeed, and the action for damages must be dismissed with costs here
and below.

Commentary
Scammell
 
further evidences the difficulties that the courts experience when deciding
whether or not an agreement is too vague or uncertain to be valid and binding. As
Viscount Maugham points out at the beginning of his speech, the judges in the lower
courts reached a different conclusion from that reached by the House of Lords. Viscount
Maugham also makes the point that the courts are ‘very willing’ to imply a term ‘in
commercial documents connected with dealings in a trade with which the parties are
perfectly familiar’ if they are satisfied that the parties thought that they had made a
binding contract. In such a case a court may have more to draw upon in order to give a
meaning to the vague phrase (for example, the court may be able to have regard to the
custom of the trade in which the parties were working: 
Shamrock SS Co
 
v. 
Storey and
Co
 
(1899) 81 LT 413).
One of the problems that confronted the plaintiffs on the facts of 
Scammell
 
lay in
explaining the basis on which they alleged that the parties had concluded a contract.
Lord Russell of Killowen pointed out that the decisions of the lower courts and the
arguments of counsel for the plaintiffs had been put in five different ways. Before their
Lordships, leading counsel for the plaintiffs argued that the contract was one of sale and
purchase, subject to a condition precedent that the balance of the purchase price could
be paid on reasonable 
hire-purchase terms, while junior counsel for the plaintiffs
submitted that the contract was not one of sale and purchase at all. Lord Russell of
Killowen concluded (at p. 260) that:
the existence of this fivefold choice is embarrassing but eloquent. An alleged contract which appeals for its
meaning to so many skilled minds in so many different ways is undoubtedly open to suspicion. For myself I feel
no doubt that no contract between the parties existed at all; notwithstanding that they may have thought
otherwise.
Scammell
 
is thus a case in which the court felt unable, on the basis of the evidence that
had been led, to identify the meaning which the parties had agreed should be given to
the words ‘hire-purchase’. Although such cases tend to be relatively rare (
Scammell
 
v.
Dicker
 
[2005] EWCA Civ 405, [2005] 3 All ER 838, [31] and [41]), modern cases can be
found in which the courts have concluded that the agreement was no more than an
agreement to agree and, as such, unenforceable (see, for example, 
Barbudev
 
v. 
Eurocom
Cable Management Bulgaria EOOD
 
[2012] EWCA Civ 548, [2012] 2 All ER (Comm)
963).
Why is it that the House of Lords concluded in both 
Scammell
 
and 
May and Butcher
that the agreements were not valid and enforceable? The answer would appear to lie in
the fact that their Lordships were of the view that there was no basis in the evidence for
a finding that the parties had reached agreement on the point at issue nor were there, in
their opinion, criteria or machinery agreed by the parties that the courts could employ in
order to fill the gap or resolve the uncertainty.
4.3
 
Cases in Which the Courts Have Held
the Agreement to be Valid and Binding
The courts have at their disposal a variety of techniques that they can employ in order to
resolve the uncertainty or the lack of clarity that surrounds a particular agreement. In
this respect 
May and Butcher
 
and 
Scammell
 
should be seen as the exception rather than
the rule. The principal techniques are as follows:
4.3.1
 
Make Use of the Criteria or Machinery that
Have Been Agreed by the Parties in Order to
Resolve the Uncertainty or to Clarify the Word or
Phrase that is Expressed in Vague Terms
The main stumbling-block that confronts the courts in these cases is the principle that it
is not the function of the courts to make the contract for the parties. This being the case,
the parties cannot simply leave it to the courts to resolve issues that the parties
themselves have left unresolved. To do so would be to invite the court to make the
contract for the parties and the courts will generally decline such an invitation. But the
courts will generally make use of criteria or machinery that have been agreed by the
parties in order to resolve the uncertainty or clarify the meaning of a particular word or
phrase. There are in fact a number of options open to the parties to establish some
criteria or machinery to resolve the issue. The two principal options are as follows:
4.3.1.1
 
Resolution by One or Other of the Parties
The parties can agree to entrust the resolution of the issue to one or other party to the
contract. Thus in 
May and Butcher
 
(discussed earlier) Viscount Dunedin stated that
‘with regard to price it is a perfectly good contract to say that the price is to be settled by
the buyer’. The difficulty with such a clause is that it appears to place the seller at the
mercy of the buyer. But the courts may be able to imply a term into the agreement in
order to place a limit on the power of the buyer. In 
Paragon Finance plc
 
v. 
Nash
 
[2001]
EWCA Civ 1466, [2002] 1 WLR 685 the clause at issue between the parties stated:
The rate of interest applicable to the loan and the monthly payment will be as specified in the offer of loan as
varied from time to time in accordance with the applicable mortgage condition indicated in the offer of loan.
One of the issues before the Court of Appeal was whether or not the claimant’s power to
set the interest rates from time to time was completely unfettered. The Court of Appeal
held that it was not. A term was to be implied into the agreement to the effect that the
rates of interest would not be set dishonestly, for an improper purpose, capriciously or
arbitrarily, or in a way in which no reasonable mortgagee,
 
acting reasonably, would do
(the basis upon which the Court of Appeal decided to imply this term is discussed in
more detail at 
10.4.2
). On the facts of 
Paragon Finance
 
it was held that the borrowers
had no real prospect of successfully establishing a breach of this implied term. The
reason for the increase in interest rates was that the lenders were in financial difficulties
and so had to increase their interest rates in order to protect their own financial
position. It could not be said that they had behaved dishonestly, improperly,
capriciously, arbitrarily, or unreasonably in so acting. The protection afforded by such
an implied term may be limited but it does at least ensure that one party is not left
entirely at the mercy of the other.
4.3.1.2
 
Resolution by a Third Party
Alternatively, the parties can entrust the resolution of the particular issue to a third
party, such as an arbitrator. In 
May and Butcher
 
Viscount Dunedin stated that the
parties could have agreed ‘that a certain part of the contract of sale … may be settled by
someone else’. That someone else is often, but not invariably, an arbitrator. In general,
the courts have been slower to conclude that an agreement is too uncertain to be
enforced where the agreement contains an arbitration clause (with the notable exception
of 
May and Butcher
). Thus in 
Queensland Electricity Generating Board
 
v. 
New Hope
Collieries Pty Ltd
 
[1989] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 205, 210 Sir Robin Cooke, delivering the
judgment of the Privy Council, stated:
At the present day, 
in cases where the parties have agreed on an arbitration or valuation clause in wide
enough terms
, the Courts accord full weight to their manifest intention to create continuing legal relations.
Arguments invoking alleged uncertainty, or alleged inadequacy in the machinery available to the Courts for
7
making contractual rights effective, exert minimal attraction. [Emphasis added.]
But there is a need for caution here. Sir Robin Cooke attached considerable significance
to the width of the arbitration clause, whereas the House of Lords in 
May and Butcher
placed emphasis on the terms of the agreement as a whole. The latter case demonstrates
that the presence of an arbitration clause will not inevitably lead to the conclusion that
the agreement is valid and binding; for this reason it has been criticized by arbitration
lawyers. Further, 
May and Butcher
 
is not easy to reconcile with the later decisions of the
Court of Appeal in 
Foley
 
v. 
Classique Coaches Ltd
 
[1934] 2 KB 1 (see 
4.1
) and 
F & G
Sykes (Wessex) Ltd
 
v. 
Fine Fare Ltd
 
[1967] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 53 (see 
4.3.4
) where the
presence of an arbitration clause was an important factor in persuading the court to
conclude that the agreement was valid and binding. But the proposition that an
arbitration clause should operate as a passport to the validity of an agreement is not
beyond question. Why should the parties be entitled to leave important matters for the
decision of an arbitrator when they cannot leave the same matters to be resolved by a
judge in the High Court?
4.3.1.3
 
What Happens When the Machinery Agreed by the
Parties Breaks Down?
While the courts will generally make use of the criteria or machinery that have been
agreed by the parties, what is to be done in the case where the machinery breaks down
or for some other reason does not work? In 
May and Butcher
 
Viscount Dunedin
appeared to suggest that the failure of the agreed machinery (in his example it was the
determination of a third party) would inevitably result in the conclusion that no
agreement had been reached. The modern courts, however, adopt a more flexible
approach. The leading modern case on this point is:
SUDBROOK TRADING ESTATE LTD V. EGGLETON
[1983] 1 AC 444, House of Lords
Lord Fraser of Tullybelton
My Lords, the appellants are the tenants in four leases, by each of which they were granted an option to
purchase the freehold reversion of the leased premises at a valuation. The appellants have exercised
the options, but the respondents, who are the landlords, contend that the options are unenforceable. The
questions now to be determined, therefore, are whether the options are valid and enforceable, and, if so,
how they should be enforced.
The leases relate to adjacent industrial premises in Gloucester. They were granted at different dates,
but for terms which all expire on December 24, 1997, at yearly rents which are subject to periodical
review. The leases are all in substantially the same form. … The clause in the 1949 lease, clause 11, has
been taken as typical of them all. It entitled the appellants to purchase the reversion in fee simple, upon
certain conditions which were all satisfied,
‘at such price not being less than £75,000 as may be agreed upon by two valuers one to be
nominated by the lessor and the other by the lessee or in default of such agreement by an umpire
appointed by the said valuers. …’
The respondents contend that the options are void for uncertainty on the ground that they contain no
formula by which the price can be fixed in the event of no agreement being reached, and that they are
no more than agreements to agree. The respondents have 
therefore declined to appoint their valuer. The
machinery provided in the leases has accordingly become inoperable.
In these proceedings the appellants seek a declaration that the options are valid, that they have been
validly and effectively exercised, and that the contracts constituted by the exercise ought to be
specifically performed. As regards the mode of performance, the main argument for the appellants is that
the court should order such inquiries as are necessary to ascertain the value of each of the properties.
Lawson J decided the question of principle in favour of the appellants, but his decision was reversed by
the Court of Appeal which held that the options were unenforceable. Templeman LJ, who delivered the
judgment of the Court of Appeal, made a full review of the English authorities and the conclusion which
he drew from them was, in my opinion inevitably, adverse to the appellants’ contentions. The
fundamental proposition upon which he relied was, in his own words:
‘that where the agreement on the face of it is incomplete until something else has been done,
whether by further agreement between the parties or by the decision of an arbitrator or valuer, the
court is powerless, because there is no complete agreement to enforce: …’
I agree that that is the effect of the earlier decisions but, with the greatest respect, I am of opinion that it
is wrong. It appears to me that, on the exercise of the option, the necessary preconditions having been
satisfied, as they were in this case, a complete contract of sale and purchase of the freehold reversion
was constituted. The price, which was of course an essential term of the contract, was for reasons which
I shall explain, capable of being ascertained and was therefore certain. Certum est quod certum reddi
potest: see 
May and Butcher Ltd
 
v. 
The King (Note)
 
[1934] 2 KB 17, 21, per Viscount Dunedin.
The courts have applied clauses such as those in the present case in a strictly literal way and have
treated them as making the completion of a contract of sale conditional upon agreement between the
valuers either on the value of the property, or failing that, on the choice of an umpire. They have further
laid down the principle that where parties have agreed on a particular method of ascertaining the price,
and that method has for any reason proved ineffective, the court will neither grant an order for specific
performance to compel parties to operate the agreed machinery, nor substitute its own machinery to
ascertain the price, because either of these clauses would be to impose upon parties an agreement that
they had not made …
While that is the general principle it is equally well established that, where parties have agreed to sell
‘at a fair valuation’ or ‘at a reasonable price’ or according to some similar formula, without specifying any
machinery for ascertaining the price, the position is different. … The court will order such inquiries as
may be necessary to ascertain the fair price: see 
Talbot
 
v. 
Talbot
 
[1968] Ch 1.
I recognise the logic of the reasoning which has led to the courts’ refusing to substitute their own
machinery for the machinery which has been agreed upon by the parties. But the result to which it leads
is so remote from that which parties normally intend and expect, and is so inconvenient in practice, that
there must in my opinion be some defect in the reasoning. I think the defect lies in construing the
provisions for the mode of ascertaining the value as an essential part of the agreement. That may have
been perfectly true early in the 19th century, when the valuer’s profession and the rules of valuation were
less well established than they are now. But at the present day these provisions are only subsidiary to
the main purpose of the agreement which is for sale and purchase of the property at a fair or reasonable
value. In the ordinary case parties do not make any substantial distinction between an agreement to sell
at a fair value, without specifying the mode of ascertaining the value, and an agreement 
to sell at a value
to be ascertained by valuers appointed in the way provided in these leases. The true distinction is
between those cases where the mode of ascertaining the price is an essential term of the contract, and
those cases where the mode of ascertainment, though indicated in the contract, is subsidiary and non-
essential. … The present case falls, in my opinion, into the latter category. Accordingly when the option
was exercised there was constituted a complete contract for sale, and the clause should be construed as
meaning that the price was to be a fair price. On the other hand where an agreement is made to sell at a
price to be fixed by a valuer who is named, or who, by reason of holding some office such as auditor of a
company whose shares are to be valued, will have special knowledge relevant to the question of value,
the prescribed mode may well be regarded as essential. Where, as here, the machinery consists of
valuers and an umpire, none of whom is named or identified, it is in my opinion unrealistic to regard it as
an essential term. If it breaks down there is no reason why the court should not substitute other
machinery to carry out the main purpose of ascertaining the price in order that the agreement may be
carried out.
In the present case the machinery provided for in the clause has broken down because the
respondents have declined to appoint their valuer. In that sense the breakdown has been caused by
their fault, in failing to implement an implied obligation to co-operate in making the machinery work. The
case might be distinguishable in that respect from cases where the breakdown has occurred for some
cause outside the control of either party, such as the death of an umpire, or his failure to complete the
valuation by a stipulated date. But I do not rely on any such distinction. I prefer to rest my decision on the
general principle that, where the machinery is not essential, if it breaks down for any reason the court will
substitute its own machinery …
The appropriate means for the court to enforce the present agreements is in my opinion by ordering
an inquiry into the fair value of the reversions. … The alternative of ordering the respondents to appoint a
valuer would not be suitable because in the event of the order not being obeyed, the only sanction would
be imprisonment for contempt of court which would clearly be inappropriate.
The important issue for the court is whether or not the machinery agreed by the parties
is essential or not. In 
Sudbrook
 
the majority held that it was not essential. A case on the
other side of the line is 
Gillatt
 
v. 
Sky Television Ltd
 
[2000] 1 All ER (Comm) 461. A
(1)
(2)
(3)
clause in a contract between the parties stated that, if the defendant sold or otherwise
disposed of the entire issued share capital of a company, the claimant would be entitled
to payment of ‘55% of the open market value of such shares … as determined by an
independent chartered accountant’. Neither party took any steps to appoint an
independent chartered accountant to determine the value of the shares, but the claimant
nevertheless sought to recover from the defendant a ‘sum equal to 55% of such sum as is
found to be the value of the true open market value of the issued share capital’ of the
company. The Court of Appeal held that the expression ‘as determined by an
independent chartered accountant’ was an integral and essential part of the definition of
the payments to which the claimant was entitled; it was not merely a mechanism or
permissive procedure for dispute resolution. Nor did the reference to ‘open market
value’ of the shares provide the court with adequate objective criteria because there is
more than one possible approach to the valuation of shares in a private company.
Commercial indications also suggested that the parties intended that the determination
of the open market value of the shares should be carried out by an independent
accountant 
and not by the court. Finally, there was no question in this case, unlike
Sudbrook
, of the ‘breakdown’ of machinery for the determination of value. Neither party
had attempted to invoke the procedure laid down in the clause, and the court refused to
substitute something different (its own opinion of the market value of the shares) in
place of what the parties had actually agreed. It therefore followed that no payment was
due to the claimant under the clause in the contract.
4.3.2
 
The Intervention of Statute
Occasionally statute may intervene to provide an answer to the issue that has not been
resolved by the parties. The principal example in this category is section 8 of the Sale of
Goods Act 1979 which provides:
The price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract, or may be left to be fixed in a manner agreed
by the contract, or may be determined by the course of dealing between the parties.
Where the price is not determined as mentioned in subsection (1) above the buyer must pay a reasonable
price.
What is a reasonable price is a question of fact dependent on the circumstances of each particular case.
Section 8(2) was not applicable on the facts of 
May and Butcher
 
because it only comes
into play where the contract is silent as to the price of the goods and the contract in 
May
and Butcher
 
was not silent. It purported to make provision for the determination of the
price and this was sufficient to exclude the operation of section 8. It may seem odd that
section 8 only comes into play when the contract is silent and not where the contract
purports to deal with the issue. However, it is not open to the courts to alter the clear
meaning of a statutory provision.
4.3.3
 
Severance
The court may be able to sever the term that is alleged to be vague or uncertain and
enforce the rest of the contract. An example of this process at work is provided by the
case of 
Nicolene Ltd
 
v. 
Simmonds
 
[1953] 1 QB 543. The defendant sent to the plaintiffs
an acceptance of the plaintiffs’ order which contained the following sentence:
As you have made the order direct to me, I am unable to confirm on my usual printed form which would have
the usual force majeure and war clauses, but I assume that we are in agreement and that the usual conditions of
acceptance apply.
The plaintiffs replied to this letter, confirming the order. The defendant failed to deliver
the goods and so the plaintiffs brought an action for damages for breach of contract. The
defendant denied that a contract had been concluded on the ground that there were no
‘usual conditions’ in operation between the parties. The defence failed. The Court of
Appeal held 
that the reference to ‘usual conditions’ was meaningless and could be struck
out without impairing the rest of the contract. Denning LJ stated (at p. 551):
In my opinion a distinction must be drawn between a clause which is meaningless and a clause which is yet to
be agreed. A clause which is meaningless can often be ignored, whilst still leaving the contract good; whereas a
clause which has yet to be agreed may mean that there is no contract at all, because the parties have not agreed
on all the essential terms.
I take it to be clear law that if one of the parties to a contract inserts into it an exempting condition in his
own favour, which the other side agrees, and it afterwards turns out that that condition is meaningless, or what
comes to the same thing, that it is so ambiguous that no ascertainable meaning can be given to it, that does not
mean that the whole contract is a nullity. It only means that the exempting condition is a nullity and must be
rejected. It would be strange indeed if a party could escape every one of his obligations by inserting a
meaningless exception from some of them …
In the present case there was nothing yet to be agreed. There was nothing left to further negotiation. All that
happened was that the parties merely agreed that ‘the usual conditions of acceptance apply’. That clause was so
vague and uncertain as to be incapable of any precise meaning. It is clearly severable from the rest of the
contract. It can be rejected without impairing the sense or reasonableness of the contract as a whole, and it
should be so rejected. The contract should be held good and the clause ignored. The parties themselves treated
the contract as subsisting. They regarded it as creating binding obligations between them; and it would be most
unfortunate if the law should say otherwise. You would find defaulters all scanning their contracts to find some
meaningless clause on which to ride free.
The result was that the contract was to be found in the exchange of correspondence
between the parties and the defendant’s letter was to be read as an unqualified
acceptance of the plaintiffs’ order.
One of the cases relied upon by the defendant was 
Scammell & Nephew
 
v. 
Ouston
 
(see
4.2
) but Denning LJ distinguished it (at p. 551) on the ground that, in that case, ‘there
were hire-purchase terms yet to be agreed’ and he noted that Lord Wright stated that the
‘agreement was inchoate, and never got beyond negotiations’. He also distinguished
Scammell
 
on the ground that the term in the present case was ‘clearly severable from
the rest of the contract’ while the term in 
Scammell
 
was not. The more important the
term to the transaction as a whole, the less likely it is that the court will be able to sever
it from the rest of the agreement.
4.3.4
 
Implication of Terms
Finally, the court may be able to imply a term the effect of which will be to fill the gap
that was left by the parties. The courts do not have the power to imply a term into a
contract simply on the basis that it would be reasonable to imply such a term into the
contract (see 
10.4.2
). A term will only be implied where it is necessary to do so. It was
once thought that the courts would not imply a term into a contract which was
incomplete. In other words, the court had to first establish the existence of a binding
contract before it could consider whether or not it was appropriate to imply a term into
the contract. However, the Supreme 
Court in 
Wells
 
v. 
Devani
 
[2019] UKSC 4, [2020] AC
129 held that there was no such rule of English law. Thus Lord Kitchin stated (at [35]):
[W]here, as here, the parties intended to create legal relations and have acted on that basis, I believe that it may
be permissible to imply a term into the agreement between them where it is necessary to do so to give the
agreement business efficacy if the term would be so obvious that ‘it goes without saying’, and where, without
that term, the agreement would be regarded as incomplete or too uncertain to be enforceable.
This being the case, there is no need first to identify the existence of a contract before
consideration can be given to the question whether to imply a term into that contract. A
term can be implied into what would otherwise be an incomplete agreement if it is
necessary to do so in order to make the contract work as intended by the parties.
The courts are more likely to imply a term into the contract when the parties have acted
on the basis of or (as it is often put) in reliance upon their agreement. Thus in 
F & G
Sykes (Wessex) Ltd
 
v. 
Fine Fare Ltd
 
[1967] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 53 Lord Denning stated (at pp.
57–58):
In a commercial agreement the further the parties have gone on with their contract, the more ready are the
Courts to imply any reasonable term so as to give effect to their intentions. When much has been done, the
Courts will do their best not to destroy the bargain. When nothing has been done, it is easier to say there is no
agreement between the parties because the essential terms have not been agreed. But when an agreement has
been acted upon and the parties, as here, have been put to great expense in implementing it, we ought to imply
all reasonable terms so as to avoid any uncertainties. In this case there is less difficulty than in others because
there is an arbitration clause which, liberally construed, is sufficient to resolve any uncertainties which the
parties have left.
To similar effect is the judgment of Steyn LJ in 
G Percy Trentham Ltd
 
v. 
Archital Luxfer
Ltd
 
[1993] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 25 when he stated (at p. 27) that, ‘the fact that the transaction
is executed 
makes it easier
 
to imply a term resolving any uncertainty, or, alternatively, it
may make it possible to treat a matter not finalized in negotiations as inessential’
(emphasis added). Thus the point that is being made is not that action in reliance upon
the agreement will inevitably result in the conclusion that the agreement is valid and
binding (a case in point being 
May and Butcher
 
where the fact that the suppliants had
apparently deposited £1,000 as security was not sufficient to render the agreement
between the parties sufficiently certain to be enforced). Rather, the point is that reliance
makes it easier for the court to find that the agreement is valid and binding, by
providing evidence from which the court can infer that the parties had reached
agreement on all essential terms. However, the courts do not find the existence of an
agreement in every case where the agreement has been partially or substantially
executed. The court will not impose upon the parties a binding agreement which they
have not reached (
RTS Flexible Systems Ltd
 
v. 
Molkerei Alois Müller GmbH & Co KG
(UK Production)
 
[2010] UKSC 14, [2010] 1 WLR 753, [47]). Thus in 
British Steel
Corporation
 
v. 
Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co Ltd
 
[1984] 1 All ER 504
(discussed at 
3.3.1
), Robert Goff J refused to find the existence of a contract between the
parties, despite the fact that both parties had acted on the agreement, and he looked to
the law of restitution to resolve the dispute between the parties.

Conclusion
English law is often criticized on the ground that it adopts an unduly restrictive
approach to these issues and, in this respect, the decision of the House of Lords in 
May
and Butcher
 
is often held out as the prime illustration of this restrictive tendency. While
cases can be found in which the courts have adopted a more relaxed approach, it can be
argued that these are no more than piecemeal interventions which fail to provide a
coherent set of principles to guide the courts when seeking to decide whether or not an
agreement that is expressed in terms that are uncertain, incomplete, or vague is
nevertheless valid and binding. Bearing in mind Professor Macneil’s warning that the
search for coherent principles in this area is a ‘fool’s errand’ (see 
4.1
), would English law
be put on a sounder footing if it adopted the following rules in place of its existing rules?
Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts: Conclusion of contract dependent on
agreement on specific matters or in a particular form
Where in the course of negotiations one of the parties insists that the contract is not concluded
until there is agreement on specific matters or in a particular form, no contract is concluded
before agreement is reached on those matters or in that form.
Contract with terms deliberately left open
If the parties intend to conclude a contract, the fact that they intentionally leave a term to
be agreed upon in further negotiations or to be determined by a third person does not
prevent a contract from coming into existence.
The existence of the contract is not affected by the fact that subsequently
the parties reach no agreement on the term, or
the third person does not determine the term,
provided that there is an alternative means of rendering the term definite that is
reasonable in the circumstances, having regard to the intention of the parties.
These provisions are more liberal than the approach taken by the House of Lords in
May and Butcher
. They therefore add further weight to the argument that 
May and
Butcher
 
is out of line with the demands of modern commercial practice. That said, it
should be noted that these provisions are all expressed in broad terms and so may not
provide the clear guidance that English courts and practitioners generally seek.

Consideration and Promissory Estoppel
Central Issues
The doctrine of consideration is a feature of English contract law that
is not to be found in civilian legal systems. It is now a very technical
doctrine and it has been the subject of considerable criticism.
The essence of the doctrine of consideration is that a promisee cannot
enforce a promise unless he has given or promised to give something
in exchange for the promise or unless the promisor has obtained or
been promised something in return. In other words, there must have
been a bargain between the parties.
The doctrine of consideration can be explained in outline in the form
of three rules: (i) consideration must be sufficient but need not be
adequate, (ii) consideration must not be past, and (iii) consideration
must move from the promisee.
There is an important conflict at the heart of the rules that make up the
doctrine of consideration and that relates to the test to be applied
when seeking to identify the existence of a benefit obtained or a
detriment suffered by the contracting parties. The Court of Appeal in
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
 
looked for the existence of a practical benefit,
whereas the House of Lords in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
applied a much stricter
test that focused on whether the promisee had, as a matter of law,
received a benefit. The relationship between these two cases is a
major part of this chapter.
A promise which is not supported by consideration may nevertheless
be given legal effect as a result of the operation of an ‘estoppel’.
‘Estoppel’ is not a word that is used in everyday language and it is a
concept that is difficult to explain, largely because it appears to defy
classification. In essence, the effect of an estoppel may be to prevent a
party from going back on his promise when the person to whom the
6.
promise has been made has acted on it to his detriment. However, the
scope of estoppel is limited by a number of rules, the most important
of which is that estoppel cannot create a cause of action. The scope of
these rules, the criticisms made of them, and the justifications offered
in support of them are considered in this chapter.
Finally, the chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the future of
the doctrine of consideration and, in particular, it draws on the critique
of consideration developed by Professor Atiyah.
5.1
 
Introduction
One feature of English contract law that readily distinguishes it from the law of contract
in civilian jurisdictions is the doctrine of consideration. As we shall see, the scope of the
doctrine is the subject of some debate. The orthodox view is that consideration is about
reciprocity or bargains. In order to be entitled to enforce a promise, a promisee must
have given something in return for the promise. The fundamental distinction is
therefore between a bargain and a promise to make a gift. The former is enforceable,
while the latter is not unless it is made in a deed (on deeds see further 
Chapter 6
). This
conception of consideration has been challenged by a number of writers, in particular by
Professor Atiyah. We shall return to these criticisms at the end of the chapter after we
have examined the current scope of the doctrine of consideration. But it is necessary
first of all to outline the principal criticisms that have been levelled against the doctrine
because they ought to be borne in mind when reading the cases that seek to determine
its scope.
Five principal criticisms can be levelled against the doctrine of consideration. The first is
that it is too narrow in its scope and so fails to give effect to promises that ought to have
legal effect. Thus Professor Dawson has argued (
Gifts and Promises
 
(Yale University
Press, 1980), pp. 3–4) that:
even the most embittered critics of bargain consideration do not really object to the enforcement of bargains.
The objection has been to its transformation into a formula of denial, a formula that would deny legal effect to
most promises for which there is nothing given or received in exchange.
Secondly, the doctrine has become extremely technical, a point evidenced by the fact
that the account of the doctrine contained in the current edition of Treitel’s classic
textbook on the law of contract exceeds 100 pages. Thirdly, it has been argued that the
doctrine is divorced from commercial reality. It is much harder to evaluate the merits of
this claim because the doctrine is rarely in issue in modern commercial practice. The
reason for this is that it is a relatively simple matter for a lawyer to ensure that
consideration is provided. The law does not, in general, inquire into the adequacy of the
consideration that has been supplied (see further 
5.2.1
). As long as some consideration
has been provided the requirements of the doctrine are satisfied. Thus one can find
transactions, reported in the media, of major businesses being sold for £1. In such cases
the company that is acquired is usually debt-ridden, and the reason for the payment of
£1 is simply to ensure that consideration has been supplied for the promise to sell the
company. Where there is doubt about the presence or absence of consideration, lawyers
might make use of a deed and so avoid the problem, because a promise contained in a
deed is enforceable whether or not consideration has been supplied (see further 
6.3.1
).
In this respect the doctrine of consideration is not of major significance in modern
commercial transactions. On the other hand, there are some commercial transactions
which are difficult to explain in terms that are consistent with the requirements of the
doctrine of consideration (an example being, perhaps, the letter of credit, on which see
5.4
). Fourthly, it is extremely difficult to reconcile the doctrine of consideration with any
of the modern theoretical models of contract law (see SA Smith, 
Contract Theory
(Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 215–233). For example, if contract law is based
upon the promise principle or upon the will of the parties, why insist upon the presence
of consideration in order to render the promise enforceable? Fifthly, it has been argued
that the doctrine of consideration is over-broad and that the work that is currently done
by the doctrine 
could be done more effectively by more specific doctrines such as duress,
unconscionability, estoppel, and intention to create legal relations which can target with
greater precision the reason for the law’s refusal to give effect to the promise that has
been made. But it would not be true to say that the doctrine of consideration is devoid of
support. Thus it has been stated (M Chen-Wishart, ‘Reciprocity and Enforceability’ in M
Chen-Wishart, L Ho, and P Kapai, 
Reciprocity in Contract
 
(University of Hong Kong,
2010) p. 10) that:
the consideration doctrine is not an embarrassment to the common law. It recognises and expresses our deep
instinct for reciprocity; an instinct which enhances co-operation and division of labour, while preserving social
equilibrium. It represents the terms of engagement between equals who are deserving of respect. By requiring
the reciprocation to be explicit, the consideration doctrine keeps the state away from the private domain where
external coercion would distort the practice of gift-giving and so destroy much which is valuable about it.
At this point it is not necessary to reach a final conclusion on the relative strengths and
weaknesses of these arguments. It suffices to note that consideration is a doctrine that is
under some pressure. While consideration may be said to be a distinctive feature of
English contract law, it is probably true to say that it is a feature that many English
contract lawyers could live without. Thus Lord Goff stated in 
White
 
v. 
Jones
 
[1995] 2 AC
207, 262 that ‘our law of contract is widely seen as deficient in the sense that it is
perceived to be hampered by the presence of an unnecessary doctrine of consideration’.
But, while the doctrine may ‘not be very popular nowadays … [it] still exists as part of
our law’ (
Johnson
 
v. 
Gore Wood & Co (A Firm)
 
[2001] 1 All ER 481, 507 per Lord Goff)
and, as such, it must be applied by the courts.
The principal part of this chapter is devoted to an analysis of the current scope of the
doctrine of consideration. This analysis will be followed by a discussion of the role of
estoppel, in particular the role of promissory estoppel, in contract cases. The reason for
including estoppel at this stage is that the effect of an estoppel is to give (at least limited)
effect to a promise that would otherwise be unenforceable. Thus the effect of an estoppel
may be to supplement, or even supplant, the doctrine of consideration. It is therefore
necessary to consider the scope of estoppel alongside the doctrine of consideration
before embarking upon a critical evaluation of the role of the doctrine of consideration
in English contract law.
5.2
 
Consideration: Its Scope
Conventional accounts of the doctrine of consideration start with the classic definition of
the doctrine adopted by Lush J in 
Currie
 
v. 
Misa
 
(1875) LR 10 Ex 153, 162. He stated:
A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit, or benefit
accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility, given, suffered, or undertaken
by the other.
This definition has been amplified in the following terms (Treitel, 
The Law of Contract
(15th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited by Edwin Peel), para 3–004):
The traditional definition of consideration concentrates on the requirement that ‘something of value’ must be
given and accordingly states that consideration is either some detriment 
to the promisee (in that he may give
value) or some benefit to the promisor (in that he may receive value). Usually, this detriment and benefit are
merely the same thing looked at from different points of view. Thus payment by a buyer is consideration for the
seller’s promise to deliver and can be described as a detriment to the buyer or as a benefit to the seller; and
conversely delivery by a seller is consideration for the buyer’s promise to pay and can be described either as a
detriment to the seller or as a benefit to the buyer. These statements relate to the consideration 
for the promise
of each party
 
looked at separately. For example, the seller suffers a ‘detriment’ when he delivers the goods and
this enables him to enforce the buyer’s promise to pay the price. It is quite irrelevant that the seller has made a
good bargain and so gets a benefit from the performance of the contract. What the law is concerned with is the
consideration 
for a promise
—not the consideration 
for a contract
.
Two points should be noted about this definition, as amplified by Treitel. The first is that
the requirement of consideration can be satisfied by the presence of benefit 
or
detriment. The law does not generally insist that both elements be present (although
frequently they are). The second point concerns the use of the phrase ‘in the sense of the
law’ in the judgment of Lush J. This suggests that it is for the law to decide whether or
not consideration has been supplied. This has in fact proved to be an issue of some
controversy in the cases. While it is no doubt true to say that, in the final analysis, it is
for the courts to decide whether or not consideration has been provided, the courts on a
number of occasions have given considerable weight to the preferences of the parties to
the contract when deciding whether or not something of value has been given or
promised (see further 
5.2.1
).
The rules that make up the doctrine of consideration can be set out in the form of three
principal rules. The first is that consideration must be sufficient but need not be
adequate. This rule can be further broken down into a number of sub-rules and has
proved to be particularly problematic in the case where the consideration is alleged to
take the form of a promise to perform or the performance of a pre-existing duty. The
second rule is that past consideration is not good consideration, and the third is that
consideration must move from the promisee. Each rule requires further analysis, but
most attention will be given to the first rule.
5.2.1
 
Consideration Must be Sufficient
The rule that consideration must be sufficient but that it need not be adequate requires
that 
something
 
of value must be given in return for a promise but that something need
not be an adequate return. In other words, the doctrine of consideration requires the
existence of a bargain but it does not demand that the bargain be a good one. The
parties, and not the doctrine of consideration, are in general the arbiters of what
constitutes a good or a bad bargain. However, it does not follow from the fact that the
doctrine of consideration is not interested in the fairness of the bargain that the law of
contract is similarly disinterested. A number of contractual rules and doctrines, such as
duress and undue influence, are concerned with the fairness of the bargain that has been
concluded by the parties (these rules are discussed in 
Chapters 18–20
).
What does it mean to say that consideration must be ‘sufficient’? Who decides whether
or not the consideration is ‘sufficient’? Is it the parties or is it the court? In answering
these questions it is useful to distinguish the case where the alleged consideration takes
the form of a promise to pay money for a service or a product from the case where the
promise takes the form of a promise to provide some non-monetary benefit.
Where the promise is one to pay money for a service or a product (here used to
encompass both goods and land) the law does not generally encounter any difficulty.
The example has already been given (see 
5.1
) of a contract for the sale of a business. In
such a case a promise to pay £1 for the business does constitute the provision of
sufficient consideration. Such consideration is often described as ‘nominal
consideration’. The label ‘nominal’ should not be taken to imply that the law regards
such transactions with suspicion. As Professor Atiyah has observed (‘Consideration: A
Restatement’ in 
Essays on Contract
 
(Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 194), a ‘promise
for nominal consideration is just about the clearest possible indication that the promisor
intended his promise seriously and intended to give the promisee a legally enforceable
right’. The reason for this is that the parties will generally have been advised by lawyers
to make £1 payable precisely in order to render the agreement legally enforceable. Of
course, if the promise to sell the business for such a small amount of money has been
extracted by pressure that amounts in law to duress (on which see 
5.2.2.3.2.3
) then the
promise may not be enforceable but, in the absence of such a vitiating factor, the
promise is enforceable. A distinction is sometimes drawn between ‘nominal
consideration’ and consideration which is ‘inadequate’ but, for most purposes, the
distinction does not matter.
The issue is more difficult where the alleged consideration takes a form other than a
promise to pay a sum of money. Here we encounter the question whether it is for the
courts or the parties to determine what constitutes sufficient consideration. Take an
extreme example. Suppose that A promises to pay B £5,000 if B promises in return to
stand on one leg for 90 seconds. Does B provide consideration by promising to stand on
one leg for 90 seconds? The courts have generally adopted a liberal approach to the
identification of consideration and cases can be found in which trifling or apparently
insignificant acts have been held to constitute consideration, as can be seen from the
following case.
CHAPPELL & CO LTD V. THE NESTLÉ CO LTD
[1960] AC 87, House of Lords
The plaintiffs were the owners of the copyright in a musical work entitled ‘Rockin’
Shoes’. The defendants offered to supply gramophone records which included
Rockin’ Shoes to anyone sending in a postal order for 1s 6d together with three
wrappers from bars of Nestlé milk chocolate. The plaintiffs alleged that the
manufacture and sale of this record amounted to an infringement of their copyright
in the song. The defendants relied by way of defence on section 8 of the Copyright
Act 1956 which, in essence, permitted the making of records of a musical work that
the manufacturer intended to sell by retail provided that he gave the owner of the
copyright prior notice and paid a royalty of 6¼ per cent of the ‘ordinary retail selling
price’ of the record. The defendants notified the plaintiffs that the ordinary retail
1
selling price of the records would not be greater than 1s 6d. The plaintiffs
submitted that this notice did not satisfy the requirements of section 8 because it
did not take into account the three wrappers from the chocolate bars. They
accordingly sought an injunction to restrain the defendants from infringing their
copyright. The defendants denied that the wrappers 
were part of the consideration
and they pointed to the fact that the wrappers, when received, were worthless and
were in fact thrown away. The House of Lords held by a bare majority (Viscount
Simonds and Lord Keith of Avonholm dissenting) that the sending of the wrappers
was not simply a condition which had to be fulfilled before a copy of the record
could be obtained: it was part of the consideration for the sale of the record. The
defendants had therefore not complied with the requirements of section 8 and the
plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction restraining the defendants from infringing
their copyright.
Viscount Simonds
[dissenting]
In my opinion, my Lords, the wrappers are not part of the selling price. They are
admittedly themselves valueless and are thrown away and it was for that reason,
no doubt, that Upjohn J [the trial judge] was constrained to say that their value lay
in the evidence they afforded of success in an advertising campaign. That is what
they are. But what, after all, does that mean? Nothing more than that someone, by
no means necessarily the purchaser of the record, has in the past bought not from
Nestlés but from a retail shop three bars of chocolate and that the purchaser has
thus directly or indirectly acquired the wrappers. How often he acquires them for
himself, how often through another, is pure speculation. The only thing that is
certain is that, if he buys bars of chocolate from a retail shop or acquires the
wrappers from another who has bought them, that purchase is not, or at the lowest
is not necessarily, part of the same transaction as his subsequent purchase of a
record from the manufacturers.
I conclude, therefore, that the objection fails, whether it is contended that (in the
words of Upjohn J) the sale ‘bears no resemblance at all to the transaction to
which the section … is pointing’ or that the three wrappers form part of the selling
price and are incapable of valuation. Nor is there any need to take what, with
respect, I think is a somewhat artificial view of a simple transaction. What can be
easier than for a manufacturer to limit his sales to those members of the public
who fulfil the qualification of being this or doing that? It may be assumed that the
manufacturer’s motive is his own advantage. It is possible that he achieves his
object. But that does not mean that the sale is not a retail sale to which the section
applies or that the ordinary retail selling price is not the price at which the record is
ordinarily sold, in this case 1s. 6d.
Lord Reid
To determine the nature of the contract one must find the intention of the parties as
shown by what they said and did. The Nestlé Co’s intention can hardly be in doubt.
They were not setting out to trade in gramophone records. They were using these
records to increase their sales of chocolate. Their offer was addressed to
everyone. It might be accepted by a person who was already a regular buyer of
their chocolate; but, much more important to them, it might be accepted by people
who might become regular buyers of their chocolate if they could be induced to try
it and found they liked it. The inducement was something calculated to look like a
bargain, a record at a very cheap price. It is in evidence that the ordinary price for
a dance record is 6s. 6d. It is true that the ordinary record gives much longer
playing time than the Nestlé records and it may have other advantages. But the
reader of the Nestlé offer was not in a position to know that.
It seems to me clear that the main intention of the offer was to induce people
interested in this kind of music to buy (or perhaps get others to buy) chocolate
which otherwise would not have been bought. It is, of course, true that some
wrappers might come from the chocolate which had already been bought or from
chocolate which would have been bought without 
the offer, but that does not seem
to me to alter the case. Where there is a large number of transactions—the notice
mentions 30,000 records—I do not think we should simply consider an isolated
case where it would be impossible to say whether there had been a direct benefit
from the acquisition of the wrappers or not. The requirement that wrappers should
be sent was of great importance to the Nestlé Co; there would have been no point
in their simply offering records for 1s. 6d. each. It seems to me quite unrealistic to
divorce the buying of the chocolate from the supplying of the records. It is a
perfectly good contract if a person accepts an offer to supply goods if he (a) does
something of value to the supplier and (b) pays money: the consideration is both
(a) and (b). There may have been cases where the acquisition of the wrappers
conferred no direct benefit on the Nestlé Co, but there must have been many
cases where it did. I do not see why the possibility that in some cases the
acquisition of the wrappers did not directly benefit the Nestlé Co should require us
to exclude from consideration the cases where it did; and even where there was no
direct benefit from the acquisition of the wrappers there may have been an indirect
benefit by way of advertisement …
I am of opinion that the … notice that the ordinary retail selling price was 1s.
6d. was invalid, that there was no ordinary retail selling price in this case and that
the respondents’ operations were not within the ambit of section 8. They were
therefore infringements of the appellants’ copyright and in my judgment this appeal
should be allowed.
Lord Somervell of Harrow
The question … is whether the three wrappers were part of the consideration or, as
Jenkins LJ held, a condition of making the purchase, like a ticket entitling a
member to buy at a co-operative store. I think they are part of the consideration.
They are so described in the offer. ‘They,’ the wrappers, ‘will help you to get smash
hit recordings.’ They are so described in the record itself—‘all you have to do to get
such new record is to send three wrappers from Nestlé’s 6d. milk chocolate bars,
together with postal order for 1s. 6d.’ This is not conclusive but, however
described, they are, in my view, in law part of the consideration. It is said that when
received the wrappers are of no value to Nestlés. This I would have thought
irrelevant. A contracting party can stipulate for what consideration he chooses. A
peppercorn does not cease to be good consideration if it is established that the
promisee does not like pepper and will throw away the corn. As the whole object of
selling the record, if it was a sale, was to increase the sales of chocolate, it seems
to me wrong not to treat the stipulated evidence of such sales as part of the
consideration.
Lord Tucker
 
delivered a speech in which he concluded that the defendants had
not complied with the requirements of section 8 so that the plaintiffs were entitled
to an injunction in the term sought. 
Lord Keith of Avonholm
 
dissented.
Commentary
The issue that divided the majority and the minority was whether the supply of the
chocolate bar wrappers was a condition that had to be satisfied in order to obtain the
record but was not part of the consideration or whether it was part of the consideration
itself. The distinction is not always an easy one to draw. As Lord Wedderburn has
remarked ([1959] 
CLJ
 
160, 161), it is ‘notoriously difficult to set out satisfactory
theoretical distinctions between bare promises of gifts subject to contingent conditions,
and offers proper, e.g. in regard to statements such as: “if you go to London on Monday,
I will give you £10”.’ On the facts of 
Chappell
 
the majority construction was that the
supply of chocolate bar wrappers was part of the consideration (although it should be
noted that both sides expressed themselves in strong terms: Viscount Simonds stated
that the majority construction was ‘quite artificial’ while Lord Reid stated that the
minority construction was ‘quite unrealistic’).
The litigation in 
Chappell
 
was not between a purchaser of a chocolate bar and the
supplier of the records. So the House of Lords was not actually asked to enforce a
contract under which one party promised to sell goods to another in return for payment
by chocolate bar wrappers. Nevertheless, the question whether or not the chocolate bar
wrappers were part of the consideration for the supply of the record was integral to the
decision of their Lordships. It would therefore appear to follow from their decision that
a contract to sell a record in return for chocolate bar wrappers is a contract that is
supported by consideration. But does it follow from 
Chappell
 
that a promise to supply
chocolate bar wrappers will always constitute consideration for a promise given in
return? Take the case of a promise to sell a work of art, valued at £2 million, in return
for three chocolate bar wrappers. Is the promise to sell the work of art supported by
consideration? 
Chappell
 
does not necessarily support such a conclusion. The reason for
this is that Nestlé had good commercial reasons for asking for the supply of chocolate
bar wrappers. It was an integral part of their marketing strategy in that their purpose
was to encourage people to buy their products. In the case of the sale of the work of art
there appears to be no objectively good reason for asking for the supply of chocolate bar
wrappers; it could be attributable simply to the subjective whim of the vendor. On the
other hand it can be argued that it is for the parties to decide what is to constitute good
consideration. If a party chooses to ask for a performance which others would regard as
bizarre, that is arguably no concern of the law.
Nevertheless it would appear that the courts do reserve to themselves the right to decide
that a particular act alleged to amount to consideration does not in fact do so. In
Thomas
 
v. 
Thomas
 
(1842) 2 QB 851, 859 Patteson J stated that ‘consideration means
something which is of some value in the eye of the law’. This statement is not altogether
easy to reconcile with the statement of Lord Somervell in 
Chappell
 
that ‘a contracting
party can stipulate for what consideration he chooses’. It would appear that the starting
point, at least in commercial cases, is that it is for the parties to decide what is or is not
of value, but that the court nevertheless retains the right to conclude that the alleged
consideration does not in law have any value and so does not amount to consideration.
But the courts should be slow to conclude that something which the parties believe to be
of value is not in fact of value. Lord Wedderburn, commenting on 
Chappell
 
([1959] 
CLJ
160, 162), summed the matter up as follows:
[I]f the offer requires a certain act from the offeree, it is not open to the courts to speculate about whether it has
any ‘real value’ in the mind of the offeror. Such an inquiry would approach perilously near to an investigation of
motive. Provided that it is not wholly illusory, the act becomes part of the consideration because it is asked for
by the offeree.
Of course it may not always be easy to decide whether or not an alleged consideration is
‘wholly illusory’ but in most cases it will be tolerably clear.
5.2.1.1
 
A benevolent approach in commercial cases
In commercial cases the courts have tended to adopt a benevolent approach. This can be
seen from a number of cases. The first is 
Bainbridge
 
v. 
Firmstone
 
(1838) 8 A & E 743.
The defendant 
asked for permission to weigh two of the plaintiff’s boilers and he
promised to return them to the plaintiff in the same condition as they were in when he
took possession of them. The plaintiff gave his permission. The defendant took the
boilers to pieces but failed to put them together again. When sued by the plaintiff the
defendant responded that no consideration had been provided for his promise to restore
the boilers. The court held otherwise. Lord Denman CJ stated (at p. 744):
It seems to me that the declaration is well enough. The defendant had some reason for wishing to weigh the
boilers; and he could do so only by obtaining permission from the plaintiff, which he did obtain by promising to
return them in good condition. We need not inquire what benefit he expected to derive. The plaintiff might have
given or refused leave.
Patteson J stated (at p. 744):
The consideration is, that the plaintiff, at the defendant’s request, had consented to allow the defendant to
weigh the boilers. I suppose the defendant thought he had some benefit; at any rate, there is a detriment to the
plaintiff from his parting with the possession for even so short a time.
The finding that consideration took the form of giving up possession of the boilers seems
more secure than the finding that the defendant obtained some (unidentified) benefit by
being given permission to weigh the plaintiff’s boilers.
5.2.1.2
 
Settling a claim that is doubtful or bad in law
A party who agrees in return for payment to give up a claim that is good in law clearly
provides consideration for the promise of payment. The claim in such a case is an asset
of value and so, in promising to give it up, value or consideration is provided.
Consideration is also provided in the case where the claim given up is a doubtful one
because, in promising to give up a claim which may have substantial value, the promisor
is clearly providing value. But can it be said that a claimant has provided consideration
where the claim that has been abandoned is one that is inevitably doomed to failure?
Cases can be found in which the courts have concluded that a promise to give up a
worthless claim can amount to the provision of consideration provided that the party
who gives up the claim is acting in good faith and does not know of the invalidity of his
claim. That this is so can be demonstrated by reference to the following two cases,
namely 
Cook
 
v. 
Wright
 
(1861) 1 B & S 559 and 
Wade
 
v. 
Simeon
 
(1846) 2 CB 548.
In 
Cook
 
v. 
Wright
 
notice was given to the defendant occupier of a house calling upon
him to pay his share of the cost of works done in an adjoining street. The defendant
objected that he was not liable to make a contribution to the cost of the works on the
ground that he was not the owner of the house. He later promised to pay a reduced
contribution in three instalments (by way of three promissory notes) after being
threatened with legal action if he did not pay. He paid the first instalment but then
refused to make any further payment. The plaintiffs, the Commissioners responsible for
carrying out the works, brought an action to recover the outstanding balance. At the trial
of the action it transpired that the defendant was not in fact personally liable to make a
contribution to the cost of the work. The court summed up the issue before it in the
following terms (at p. 568):
[I]t appeared on the evidence that [the defendant] believed himself not to be liable; but he knew that the
plaintiffs thought him liable, and would sue him if he did not pay; and in order to avoid the expense and trouble
of legal proceedings against himself he agreed to a compromise; and the question is, whether a person who has
given a note as a compromise of a claim honestly made on him, and which but for that compromise would have
been at once brought to a legal decision, can resist the payment of the note on the ground that the original claim
thus compromised might have been successfully resisted.
The Court of Common Pleas concluded that the defendant was not entitled to resist the
demand for payment and, for this purpose, it did not matter that the plaintiffs had not in
fact commenced suit at the time at which the compromise was reached. Blackburn J
stated that the ‘real consideration’ depends on ‘the reality of the claim made and the
bona fides of the compromise’. On the facts, the plaintiffs had suffered a detriment in
that the compromise had induced them not to take proceedings against the actual owner
of the house.
On the other hand, in 
Wade
 
v. 
Simeon
 
the plaintiff brought an action against the
defendant to recover £1,300 and £700. The defendant promised to pay the sum claimed
provided that the plaintiff did not pursue his claim. The plaintiff did not pursue his
claim but the defendant refused to honour his promise. The plaintiff sued to recover the
promised sum. His action failed. The vital finding of the court was that the plaintiff
knew that he had no claim against the defendant at the time at which he issued
proceedings. It was held that there was no consideration to support the defendant’s
promise. Tindal CJ stated (at pp. 564–565):
[T]he plaintiff admits that he had no cause of action against the defendant in the action … and that he knew it. It
appears to me, therefore, that he is estopped from saying that there was any valid consideration for the
defendant’s promise. It is almost contra bonos mores, and certainly contrary to all the principles of natural
justice, that a man should institute proceedings against another, when he is conscious that he has no good cause
of action. In order to constitute a binding promise, the plaintiff must shew a good consideration, something
beneficial to the defendant, or detrimental to the plaintiff. Detrimental to the plaintiff it cannot be, if he has no
cause of action: and beneficial to the defendant it cannot be; for, in contemplation of law, the defence upon such
an admitted state of facts must be successful, and the defendant will recover costs, which must be assumed to be
a full compensation for all the legal damage he may sustain. The consideration, therefore, altogether fails.
Why does the law attribute such importance to the knowledge of the claimant? Should
the presence or absence of consideration turn upon the state of mind of the claimant?
One might expect the law to conclude either that a promise to give up a worthless claim
is not good consideration (on the basis that nothing of value is given in promising to give
up a worthless claim) or that it is good consideration (on the basis that the defendant is
freed from the nuisance of having to defend the claim). Instead the law has adopted an
uneasy compromise that rests on the knowledge of the claimant. The reason for this is
probably to be found in the fact that the compromise of litigation is generally perceived
to be in the public interest (hence the general rule that giving up a claim is good
consideration) but, at the same time, the courts do not wish to encourage parties to
threaten to resort to the courts in pursuit of a claim that is known to be invalid (hence
the emphasis on the knowledge of the claimant).
5.2.1.3
 
Changing one’s behaviour
A final situation worth noting is one in which the claimant agrees to change his or her
behaviour or lifestyle as a result of the promise made by the defendant. One such case is
White
 
v. 
Bluett
 
(1853) 23 LJ Ex 36 (discussed in more detail at 
7.2.4
), in which a son
was held not to have provided consideration for his father’s promise to release him from
liability under a promissory note on condition that he stopped his practice of
complaining to his father about his father’s intentions in relation to the distribution of
his estate. But it may be that 
White
 
would not be decided the same way today (at least
on the consideration point). An indication of greater judicial willingness to find
consideration in a domestic context is provided by the New York case of 
Hamer
 
v.
Sidway
 
124 NY 538 (1891), the facts of which are set out in the judgment of the court
which was given by Parker J.
Parker J
The question which provoked the most discussion by counsel on this appeal and which lies at the foundation of
plaintiff’s asserted right of recovery, is whether by virtue of a contract defendant’s testator William E. Story
became indebted to his nephew William E. Story, 2d, on his twenty-first birthday in the sum of five thousand
dollars. The trial court found as a fact that ‘on the 20th day of March, 1869, William E. Story agreed to and with
William E. Story, 2d, that if he would refrain from drinking liquor, using tobacco, swearing, and playing cards
or billiards for money until he should become 21 years of age then he, the said William E. Story, would at that
time pay him, the said William E. Story, 2d, the sum of $5,000 for such refraining, to which the said William E.
Story, 2d, agreed,’ and that he ‘in all things fully performed his part of said agreement.’
The defendant contends that the contract was without consideration to support it, and, therefore, invalid. He
asserts that the promisee by refraining from the use of liquor and tobacco was not harmed but benefited; that
that which he did was best for him to do independently of his uncle’s promise, and insists that it follows that
unless the promisor was benefited, the contract was without consideration. A contention, which if well founded,
would seem to leave open for controversy in many cases whether that which the promisee did or omitted to do
was, in fact, of such benefit to him as to leave no consideration to support the enforcement of the promisor’s
agreement. Such a rule could not be tolerated, and is without foundation in the law …
[He set out a number of judicial and textbook definitions of the doctrine of consideration, including a
statement by Pollock that ‘consideration means not so much that one party is profiting as that the other
abandons some legal right in the present or limits his legal freedom of action in the future as an inducement for
the promise of the first’ and continued]
Now, applying this rule to the facts before us, the promisee used tobacco, occasionally drank liquor, and he
had a legal right to do so. That right he abandoned for a period of years upon the strength of the promise of the
testator that for such forbearance he would give him $5,000. We need not speculate on the effort which may
have been required to give up the use of those stimulants. It is sufficient that he restricted his lawful freedom of
action within certain prescribed limits upon the faith of his uncle’s agreement, and now having fully performed
the conditions imposed, it is of no moment whether such performance actually proved a benefit to the promisor,
and the court will not inquire into it; but were it a proper subject of inquiry, we see nothing in this record that
would permit a determination that the uncle was not benefited in a legal sense.
It is necessary to take some care with 
Hamer
 
because it is not an English case and there
is no guarantee that an English court will follow it. Nevertheless, it is widely cited in
English textbooks and it is reasonable to conclude that it is likely that an English court
would follow it. It is also consistent with the approach that we have noted in commercial
cases such as 
Chappell
 
and 
Bainbridge
 
(earlier in this section). But in what sense did
the uncle obtain a benefit as a result of the promise made by his nephew and did the
nephew suffer a detriment in promising to give up activities which his uncle believed to
be harmful to him? Has English law now reached the position that the performance of a
requested act is consideration for a promise of payment, no matter how absurd the act
that is carried out? Consider the following two extracts:
PS ATIYAH, ‘CONSIDERATION: A RESTATEMENT’ IN
ESSAYS ON CONTRACT
(Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 195
[After setting out the facts of 
Hamer
 
v. 
Sidway
 
he continues]
[T]he nephew plainly incurs no detriment in fact by forbearing from smoking (indeed, quite the
reverse) and it is hard to see that the uncle derives any benefit from the forbearance. Yet such a promise
has been held enforceable in America, and it is generally thought that it would be enforceable in
England. It may, of course, be argued that in such a case there is some indirect benefit to the uncle. No
doubt he has his reasons for wishing the nephew not to smoke or he would not have made the promise;
and no doubt he will be gratified if in fact the nephew forbears for the stated period. But here again, this
seems to be a matter of motive rather than benefit. If this were a benefit in the sense in which the word is
used in the orthodox doctrine, it would seem that many gratuitous promises would become enforceable
simply because the promisor derives a sense of satisfaction from his generosity or from the recognition
of it by the promisee or the public. Professor Treitel objects that the plaintiff in this case gave up a right;
but in a unilateral contract the plaintiff gives up no right except by his behaviour. He just acts in reliance
on the promise, and the reward cases suggest that the promise does not have to be a necessary
condition for the ‘action in reliance’. A promise of a reward to the winner of a race is generally believed to
be legally enforceable even if the winner would still have run just as effectively absent the promise. It is
hard to see that there is anything here which can sensibly be called a ‘detriment’. The truth appears to
be once again that a promise of this kind may be enforced because, if the promisee is induced to act on
it, it may appear to the courts to be just to enforce it. Although a detrimental change of position is the
usual reason for thinking it would be just to enforce the promise, the absence of detriment does not by
itself seem fatal.
JC SMITH, ‘THE LAW OF CONTRACT—ALIVE OR
DEAD?’
(1979) 13 
The Law Teacher
 
73, 77
The language of benefit and detriment is, and I believe long has been, out of date. So is the idea that
consideration must be an economic benefit of some kind. All that is necessary is that the defendant
should, expressly or impliedly, ask for something in return for his promise, an act or a promise by the
offeree. If he gets what he has asked for, then the promise is given for consideration unless there is
some vitiating factor. Though lip service has been paid to the notions of benefit and detriment, they have
no substantial meaning, 
in the light of the principle that the court will not inquire into the adequacy of the
consideration. If I make a promise to you in return for your supplying me with three, quite useless,
chocolate wrappers, which I will instantly throw away, there is a perfectly good contract provided that the
promise was seriously intended. I have got what I asked for and that is a sufficient ‘benefit’. You have
parted with something that you might have kept and that is a sufficient ‘detriment’. But the wrappers are
of no value to me, and you are perhaps glad to be rid of them. As for economic value, the judges have
recognised, for over a century, the validity of the contract to pay £100 if the promisee will walk to York …
and no one has ever demonstrated what economic value there is in walking to York. Similarly, with
promises of reward for not smoking …
5.2.2
 
The Pre-Existing Duty Rule
Assume that A is promised a sum of money by B if he, A, promises to perform an act that
he is already obliged to perform. Does A provide consideration for B’s promise of
payment? It is not easy to provide an answer to this question because the law is in a
state of flux. The answer depends in part on the nature of A’s pre-existing obligation.
The cases can be divided into three categories, namely (i) performance of a contractual
duty owed to a third party, (ii) performance of a contractual duty owed to the promisor,
and (iii) performance of a duty imposed by law. If the pre-existing obligation is a
contractual duty owed to a third party, then A will have provided consideration for B’s
promise. If, on the other hand, A’s obligation is a contractual duty owed to B, the answer
is less clear. The old case of 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
(1829) 6 Esp 129, 2 Camp 317 suggests that A
does not provide consideration by promising to perform a contractual duty owed to B,
but the modern case of 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1
QB 1 suggests that A may provide consideration in such a case. The relationship between
these two cases is the central issue in this section. Finally, if A’s obligation is one that is
imposed on him by the law (as opposed to the terms of his contract), then the general
rule is that A does not provide consideration for B’s promise of payment (although the
status of the general rule is uncertain as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeal in
Ward
 
v. 
Byham
 
[1956] 1 WLR 496 and the possible impact of the decision in 
Williams
 
v.
Roffey Bros
). Thus the traditional account of the law distinguishes between the case
where the pre-existing duty is a contractual duty owed to a third party (which clearly
constitutes consideration) and the case where the pre-existing duty is either a
contractual duty owed to the promisor or a duty imposed by law (where the general rule,
subject to 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
, is that there is no consideration).
A number of important questions have to be answered in this context. The first is
whether or not there is any justification for continuing to differentiate between these
three different categories. Why, for instance, does the law recognize the existence of
consideration where the promise is a promise to perform a pre-existing contractual duty
owed to a third party when it has been so reluctant to recognize the existence of
consideration where the promise is one to perform a pre-existing contractual duty owed
to the promisor or a pre-existing duty that is imposed by law? The second question
relates to the role of duress in these cases. As we shall see (
5.2.2.3.2.3
), it is possible that
the general refusal of the law to recognize the existence of consideration was attributable
to a desire to protect the promisor (B) from duress by the party promising to perform his
pre-existing duty (A). If duress, or the fear of duress, is indeed the concern that
underlies these cases then, it is argued, that concern 
should be reflected through the
development of rules that target behaviour that constitutes duress. Thirdly, there is an
issue relating to the conception of benefit and detriment that the law employs. If the
conception is of ‘legal benefit’ and ‘legal detriment’ then it is more difficult to find the
existence of consideration in these cases because A does not suffer a ‘legal’ detriment in
promising to perform a duty that he is already obliged to perform, and B does not
receive a ‘legal benefit’ if all that he receives is a performance to which he is already
entitled. On the other hand, the picture changes somewhat if we adopt a conception of
‘practical’ or ‘factual’ benefit and ‘practical’ detriment. A party who performs a pre-
existing obligation may incur a practical detriment in doing so and a party who receives
a performance to which he is already entitled may receive a practical benefit in
consequence. One of the most important features of 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
 
is the
emphasis that it places on ‘practical’ benefit and detriment. The final issue is whether
the law should distinguish between the requirements necessary for the creation of a
contract and the requirements necessary for the modification of an existing contract.
The traditional view has been that the law does not distinguish between formation and
modification; the doctrine of consideration applies in both contexts. But it has been
argued that the law should differentiate between contract formation and the
modification of a contract and that the doctrine of consideration, if it is to apply to
modifications at all, should apply in a much less stringent form.
5.2.2.1
 
Performance of a Contractual Duty Owed to a Third
Party
Performance of a pre-existing contractual duty owed to a third party does constitute
consideration for a promise given by another party. This proposition is supported by a
number of cases. An old case is 
Shadwell
 
v. 
Shadwell
 
(1860) 9 CB (NS) 159. An uncle
wrote to his nephew in the following terms:
My dear Lancey,
I am glad to hear of your intended marriage with Ellen Nicholl; and, as I promised to assist you at starting, I
am happy to tell you that I will pay to you £150 yearly during my life and until your annual income derived from
your profession of a Chancery barrister shall amount to 600 guineas; of which your own admission will be the
only evidence that I shall receive or require.
Your ever affectionate uncle,
Charles Shadwell
The nephew alleged that his uncle failed to honour his promise in full during his lifetime
and brought a claim for the arrears. One of the points taken by way of defence was that
there was no consideration to support this agreement. By a majority, it was held that the
promise was enforceable (Byles J dissented on the ground that the letter was ‘no more
than a letter of kindness, creating no legal obligation’). The consideration which the
plaintiff claimed that he had supplied was the performance of his contractual obligation
to marry Ellen Nicholl (at that time a promise to marry did have legal effect). In finding
that the promise to pay was supported by consideration Erle CJ stated (at pp. 173–174):
Now, do these facts shew that the promise was in consideration either of a loss to be sustained by the plaintiff or
a benefit to be derived from the plaintiff to the uncle, at his, the uncle’s request? My answer is in the affirmative.
First, do these facts shew a loss sustained by the plaintiff at his uncle’s request? When I answer this in the
affirmative, I am aware that a man’s marriage with the woman of his choice is in one sense a boon, and, in that
sense the reverse of a loss: yet, as between the plaintiff and the party promising to supply an income to support
the marriage, it may well also be a loss. The plaintiff may have made a most material change in his position, and
induced the object of his affection to do the same, and may have incurred pecuniary liabilities resulting in
embarrassments which would be in every sense a loss if the income which had been promised should be
withheld; and, if the promise was made in order to induce the parties to marry, the promise so made would be
in legal effect a request to marry.
Secondly, do these facts shew a benefit derived from the plaintiff to the uncle, at his request? In answering
again in the affirmative, I am at liberty to consider the relation in which the parties stood and the interest in the
settlement of his nephew which the uncle declares. The marriage primarily affects the parties thereto; but in a
secondary degree it may be an object of interest to a near relative, and in that sense a benefit to him. This
benefit is also derived from the plaintiff at the uncle’s request. If the promise of the annuity was intended as an
inducement to the marriage, and the averment that the plaintiff, relying on the promise, married, is an
averment that the promise was one inducement to the marriage, this is the consideration averred in the
declaration; and it appears to be expressed in the letter, construed with the surrounding circumstances.
A more modern example of the performance of a pre-existing contractual duty owed to a
third party being held to constitute consideration is provided by the decision of the Privy
Council in 
The Eurymedon
 
[1975] AC 154. There the Privy Council held that a shipper of
goods had made a promise to the defendant stevedores, who unloaded its goods from a
ship, that it would not sue them for any damage that was done to the goods while they
were being unloaded from the ship. One of the issues before the Privy Council was
whether or not the stevedores had provided consideration for the shipper’s promise not
to sue them. It was held that the performance of their contractual duty to unload the
goods (which contractual duty was owed to a third party, the carrier), was good
consideration for the shipper’s offer not to sue them for any damage done.
More difficult is the case where the consideration takes the form of a promise to
perform, as opposed to performance of, a contractual duty owed to a third party.
Initially, in 
Jones
 
v. 
Waite
 
(1839) 5 Bing NC 341 the courts took the view that a promise
to perform a contractual duty owed to a third party was not good consideration, but in
Pao On
 
v. 
Lau Yiu Long
 
[1980] AC 614 (see further 
5.2.3
) the Privy Council held that
such a promise does amount to the provision of consideration. Lord Scarman, delivering
the judgment of the Privy Council, stated (at p. 632):
Their Lordships do not doubt that a promise to perform, or the performance of, a pre-existing contractual
obligation to a third party can be valid consideration. In 
New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
AM Satterthwaite &
Co Ltd (The Eurymedon)
 
[1975] AC 154, 168 the rule and the reason for the rule were stated:
‘An agreement to do an act which the promisor is under an existing obligation to a third party to do, may
quite well amount to valid consideration … the promisee obtains the benefit of a direct obligation. … This
proposition is illustrated and supported by 
Scotson
 
v. 
Pegg
 
(1861) 6 H & N 295 which their Lordships
consider to be good law.’
It is therefore clear that both performance of, and a promise to perform, a pre-existing
contractual duty owed to a third party constitute good consideration for a promise given
in return.
5.2.2.2
 
Performance of a Duty Imposed by Law
When we turn to the case of a duty imposed by law we find a different picture. The
traditional rule is that performance of a duty imposed by law, or the promise to perform
such a duty, does not, in law, amount to the provision of consideration. In 
Collins
 
v.
Godefroy
 
(1831) 1 B & Ad 950 an attorney was subpoenaed to give evidence as a witness.
He brought a claim for payment, alleging that he had been promised a guinea a day for
his attendance. His claim failed. Lord Tenterden CJ stated (at pp. 956–957) that:
if it be a duty imposed by law upon a party regularly subpoenaed, to attend from time to time to give his
evidence, then a promise to give him any remuneration for loss of time incurred in such attendance is a promise
without consideration. We think that such a duty is imposed by law; and on consideration of the Statute of
Elizabeth, and of the cases which have been decided on this subject, we are all of opinion that a party cannot
maintain an action for compensation for loss of time in attending a trial as a witness. We are aware of the
practice which has prevailed in certain cases, of allowing, as costs between party and party, so much per day for
the attendance of professional men; but that practice cannot alter the law. What the effect of our decision may
be, is not for our consideration. We think, on principle, that an action does not lie for a compensation to a
witness for loss of time in attendance under a subpoena.
But the rule that performance of a duty imposed by law does not constitute
consideration was challenged by Lord Denning in the following two cases:
WARD V. BYHAM
[1956] 1 WLR 496, Court of Appeal
The plaintiff and the defendant were, respectively, mother and father to a child.
After they had lived together as partners for several years, and the plaintiff had
given birth to an illegitimate child, the defendant turned the plaintiff out of the family
home. Initially, the defendant put the child into the care of a neighbour for which he
paid £1 per week. When the plaintiff found a new home for herself, she agreed with
the defendant that she would care for the child and that he would pay her £1 per
week. Subsequently, the plaintiff remarried and the defendant ceased payment.
The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant on the basis of his
undertaking to pay her £1 per week. The defendant denied that he was liable to
make the promised payments on the ground that his promise to pay her was not
supported by consideration. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff had provided
consideration for the defendant’s promise with the result that the defendant was
liable to make the promised payment.
Denning LJ
[set out the facts of the case and continued]
I approach the case, therefore, on the footing that, in looking after the child, the
mother is only doing what she is legally bound to do. Even so, I think that there
was sufficient consideration to support the promise. I have always thought that a
promise to perform an existing 
duty, or the performance of it, should be regarded
as good consideration, because it is a benefit to the person to whom it is given.
Take this very case. It is as much a benefit for the father to have the child looked
after by the mother as by a neighbour. If he gets the benefit for which he stipulated,
he ought to honour his promise, and he ought not to avoid it by saying that the
mother was herself under a duty to maintain the child.
I regard the father’s promise in this case as what is sometimes called a
unilateral contract, a promise in return for an act, a promise by the father to pay £1
a week in return for the mother’s looking after the child. Once the mother
embarked on the task of looking after the child, there was a binding contract. So
long as she looked after the child, she would be entitled to £1 a week … I would
dismiss the appeal.
Morris LJ
It seems to me … that the father was saying, in effect: Irrespective of what may be
the strict legal position, what I am asking is that you shall prove that Carol [the
child] will be well looked after and happy, and also that you must agree that Carol
is to be allowed to decide for herself whether or not she wishes to come and live
with you. If those conditions were fulfilled the father was agreeable to pay. Upon
those terms, which in fact became operative, the father agreed to pay £1 a week.
In my judgment, there was ample consideration there to be found for his promise,
which I think was binding.
Parker LJ
I have come to the same conclusion. I think that the letter of July 27, 1954, clearly
expresses good consideration for the bargain, and for myself I am content to adopt
the very careful judgment of the learned county court judge.
Shortly after the decision in 
Ward
 
the Court of Appeal was given another opportunity to
consider whether or not the performance of a duty imposed by law can constitute
consideration and, once again, Lord Denning (but not the other judges) took the
opportunity to lodge an assault on the rule that such performance generally does not
constitute consideration:
WILLIAMS V. WILLIAMS
[1957] 1 WLR 148, Court of Appeal
[The facts of the case are set out in the judgment of Denning LJ.]
Denning LJ
In the present case a wife claims sums due to her under a maintenance
agreement. No evidence was called in the court below because the facts are
agreed. The parties were married on Apr. 25, 1945. They have no children. On
Jan. 24, 1952, the wife deserted the husband. On Mar. 26, 1952, they signed the
agreement now sued on, which has three clauses:
‘(1) The husband will pay to the wife for her support and maintenance a weekly sum of £1 10s. to be paid
every four weeks during the joint lives of the parties so long as the wife shall 
lead a chaste life the first
payment hereunder to be made on Apr. 15, 1952. (2) The wife will out of the said weekly sum or
otherwise support and maintain herself and will indemnify the husband against all debts to be incurred
by her and will not in any way at any time hereafter pledge the husband’s credit. (3) The wife shall not so
long as the husband shall punctually make the payments hereby agreed to be made commence or
prosecute against the husband any matrimonial proceedings other than proceedings for dissolution of
marriage but upon the failure of the husband to make the said weekly payments as and when the same
become due the wife shall be at full liberty on her election to pursue all and every remedy in this regard
either by enforcement of the provisions hereof or as if this agreement had not been made.’
So far as we know, the parties have remained apart ever since. On June 1, 1955,
the husband petitioned for divorce, on the ground of his wife’s desertion, and on
Oct. 12, 1955, a decree nisi was made against her. On Dec. 2, 1955, the decree
was made absolute. In this action the wife claims maintenance at the rate of £1
10s. a week under the agreement for a period from October, 1954, to October,
1955. The sum claimed is £30 5s. 9d., which is the appropriate sum after
deduction of tax. The husband disputes the claim, on the ground that there was no
consideration for his promise. Clause 2, he says, is worthless and cl. 3 is
unenforceable.
Let me first deal with cl. 3. It is settled law that a wife, despite such a clause as
cl. 3, can make application to the magistrates or to the High Court for
maintenance. If this wife had made such an application, the husband could have
set up the fact of desertion as an answer to the claim, but he could not have set up
cl. 3 as a bar to the proceedings. The clause is void, and as such is no
consideration to support the agreement. … Now let me deal with cl. 2. The
husband relies on the fact that his wife deserted him. If there had been a
separation by consent, he agrees that the agreement would have been
enforceable. In that case the husband would still be under a duty to maintain, and
the sum of 30s. a week would be assumed to be a quantification of a reasonable
sum for her maintenance having regard to her own earning capacity. The
ascertainment of a specific sum in place of an unascertained sum has always been
held to be good consideration. So long as circumstances remained unchanged, it
would be treated by the courts as binding on her and she could not recover more
from him. … In the present case the husband says that, as the wife deserted him,
he was under no obligation to maintain her and she was not entitled to pledge his
credit in any way. Clause 2 therefore gives him nothing and is valueless to him. …
Now I agree that, in promising to maintain herself whilst she was in desertion, the
wife was only promising to do that which she was already bound to do.
Nevertheless, a promise to perform an existing duty is, I think, sufficient
consideration to support a promise, so long as there is nothing in the transaction
which is contrary to the public interest. Suppose that this agreement had never
been made, and the wife had made no promise to maintain herself and did not do
so. She might then have sought and received public assistance or have pledged
her husband’s credit with tradesmen; in which case the National Assistance Board
might have summoned him before the magistrates, or the tradesmen might have
sued him in the county court. It is true that he would have an answer to those
claims because she was in desertion, but nevertheless he would be put to all the
trouble, worry and expense of defending himself against them. By paying her 30s.
a week and taking this promise from her that she will maintain herself and will not
pledge his credit, he has an added safeguard to protect himself from all this worry,
trouble and expense. That is a benefit to him which is good consideration for his
promise to pay maintenance. That was the view which appealed to the county
court judge, and I must say that it appeals to me also.
There is another ground on which good consideration can be found. Although
the wife was in desertion, nevertheless it must be remembered that desertion is
never irrevocable. It was 
open to her to come back at any time. Her right to
maintenance was not lost by the desertion. It was only suspended. If she made a
genuine offer to return which he rejected, she would have been entitled to
maintenance from him. She could apply to the magistrates or the High Court for an
order in her favour. If she did so, however, whilst this agreement was in force, the
30s. would be regarded as prima facie the correct figure. It is a benefit to the
husband for it to be so regarded, and that is sufficient consideration to support his
promise.
I construe this agreement as a promise by the husband to pay his wife 30s. a
week in consideration of her promise to maintain herself during the time she is
living separate from him, whether due to her own fault or not. The wife cannot
throw over the agreement and seek more maintenance from him unless new
circumstances arise making it reasonable to allow her to depart from it. The
husband cannot throw it over unless they resume married life together (in which
case it will by inference be rescinded) or they are divorced (in which case it is a
post-nuptial settlement and can be varied accordingly), or perhaps other
circumstances arise not envisaged at the time of the agreement. Nothing of that
kind has, however, occurred here. The husband must honour his promise. I would
dismiss the appeal accordingly.
Hodson
 
and 
Morris LJJ
 
delivered concurring judgments but they found for the
plaintiff on the basis that clause 2 of the agreement provided consideration for the
defendant’s promise to maintain her on the basis that her right to maintenance was
not forfeited but only in suspension and would be resurrected in the event of her
making an offer to return to the defendant.
Commentary
In both 
Ward
 
and 
Williams
 
Lord Denning launched a direct attack on the pre-existing
duty rule. The other judges were more circumspect and the cases can be explained on
the ground that the plaintiff in both cases had done more than her existing legal duty. In
Ward
 
the plaintiff did more than her legal duty in promising to keep the child happy,
while in 
Williams
 
the plaintiff’s right to maintenance had not been lost but was only in
abeyance and so she was not simply promising to perform her legal duty when she
promised to maintain herself in return for payment by her husband. 
Ward
 
is the more
problematic of the two decisions. The proposition that the plaintiff provided
consideration by promising to keep the child happy sits rather uneasily with the
proposition that a promise to provide love and affection does not in general constitute
consideration (see 
Bret
 
v. 
JS
 
(1600) Cr Eliz 755). While it is clear that a promise to do
more than one is legally obliged to do does amount to consideration, it can be difficult to
tell whether or not the claimant has promised to do more than he was in fact legally
obliged to do. This problem is not confined to cases such as 
Ward
. It is of more general
application. That this is so can be demonstrated by reference to the decision of the
House of Lords in 
Glasbrook Brothers Ltd
 
v. 
Glamorgan County Council
 
[1925] AC 270
where their Lordships divided 3–2 on the question whether the police force had done
more than their legal duty in providing protection to the owners of a colliery.
In 
Glasbrook
, a colliery manager, Mr James, applied for police protection for the colliery
in the immediate aftermath of the settlement of the national coal strike. While the
national strike had been settled, the local situation remained extremely volatile and the
men responsible for keeping the mine working had decided to cease work because of
fears for their own safety. Mr James informed the police superintendent that it was
necessary to have the police billeted in the colliery. The police superintendent was of the
view that this was unnecessary; he thought he could protect the colliery without
installing a police garrison. The police superintendent eventually agreed to garrison
seventy policemen at the colliery after Mr James 
signed a requisition in which he
promised to pay for the agreed level of service. After the dispute had come to an end
Glamorgan County Council presented the colliery owners with a bill for some £2,200
which the colliery owners refused to pay. The colliery owners submitted that there was
no consideration for their promise to pay for the police protection they had been given.
The majority concluded that consideration had been given on the ground that the police
had done more than their legal duty. Thus Viscount Cave LC stated (at p. 281):
The question for the Court was whether on July 9, 1921, the police authorities, acting reasonably and in good
faith, considered a police garrison at the colliery necessary for the protection of life and property from violence,
or, in other words, whether the decision of the chief constable in refusing special protection unless paid for was
such a decision as a man in his position and with his duties could reasonably take. If in the judgment of the
police authorities, formed reasonably and in good faith, the garrison was necessary for the protection of life and
property, then they were not entitled to make a charge for it, for that would be to exact a payment for the
performance of a duty which they clearly owed to the appellants and their servants; but if they thought the
garrison a superfluity and only acceded to Mr James’ request with a view to meeting his wishes, then in my
opinion they were entitled to treat the garrison duty as special duty and to charge for it.
He concluded on the facts (at p. 282) that the garrison ‘formed an additional and not a
substituted or alternative means of protection’ with the result that the colliery owners
were liable to pay for the services provided. Lord Carson and Lord Blanesburgh
dissented. Lord Carson expressed his dissent in the following terms (at pp. 297–298):
I cannot, on the facts of this case, myself see that the demands of the colliery owners were for anything in the
nature of a luxury. The circumstances speak for themselves, and we must in the calmer atmosphere of this
House be quite sure we realize the facts as existing at the time. The safety men had left the colliery under
compulsion, owing, as they said themselves, to want of police protection, and it is not to my mind any
justification for not protecting them that, to use the words of Superintendent Smith, they were very nervous or
unduly nervous. When the protection in the form in which it was asked for had been granted they returned to
work, and I cannot help thinking that it was in this way a great disaster was avoided. My Lords, I find great
difficulty in trying to define ‘special services’ in a case where there is actually being carried on an open invasion
of the rights of subjects and when riot and violence threaten the destruction of property of such individuals and
the right to work of other individuals, and indeed it would, I think, render the law difficult to carry out under
similar circumstances if those demanding protection were to be told at any moment in the course of such
attacks that the limit of protection had been reached unless they were rich enough to buy further protection by
agreeing to pay a sum which in this case amounted to some £3000 to the police authorities.
Given these difficulties that can arise in terms of deciding whether or not the claimant
has done more than his legal duty, should the law not take the additional step advocated
by Lord Denning and recognize that performance of a legal duty does constitute
consideration and that the transaction is enforceable provided that there is nothing in it
contrary to the public interest?
This raises the question of the rationale that lies behind the rule that performance of a
legal duty cannot in general amount to consideration. Why, for example, can the police
not 
generally charge for the public services that they render? Lord Shaw of Dunfermline
considered this issue in 
Glasbrook
 
in the following terms (at p. 290):
I clearly am of opinion that no charge can be exacted from a private citizen for the performance of a public duty.
Furthermore, I would also add that, on the assumption that a payment is made to induce or secure that the
public authority will perform such a duty, moneys paid under such a bargain are recoverable by the private
citizen on the double ground, first, that it is against public policy that the performance of public duty shall be a
matter of private purchase, and second, that a promise or agreement to pay, accepted from a citizen in times of
nervous alarm or anxiety, fails in legality on the ground of duress, and sums paid under it must be restored.
It is important to note the two distinct grounds advanced by Lord Shaw. The second
objection is narrower than the first. The second objection is based on duress: absent
duress, or, possibly, the fear of duress, a promise to perform an existing legal duty does
amount to consideration. The first ground is wider in that it is based on the public duty,
which the police owe to the general public (see also 
Michael
 
v. 
Chief Constable of South
Wales Police
 
[2015] UKSC 2, [2015] AC 1732, [30]–[33]) and which takes account of a
broader range of factors than simply the presence or absence of duress. Take the case
where a member of the public freely agrees to pay a policeman for services which the
policeman was obliged by law to perform. Should the promise to pay the policeman be
enforceable? On the basis of Lord Shaw’s first ground it should not, but on the second it
seems that it may be enforceable. Does the example of a promise to pay a member of the
police force for the performance of a legal duty not suggest that there is good sense
behind the general rule that performance of a legal duty is not good consideration and
that the public policy objection is more deeply rooted than the fear of duress? On the
other hand, does this public policy objection apply with the same force on the facts of
either 
Ward
 
or 
Williams
? Were the parties in either case seeking to turn the
performance of a ‘public duty’ into a ‘matter of private purchase’? While there is
obviously a public interest in ensuring that children are cared for and looked after, does
this public policy require that the law should refuse to give effect to private bargains
between parents in relation to their obligations in respect of the care of their children?
Notwithstanding the views expressed by Lord Denning the formal position in English
law remains that performance of a legal duty does not amount to consideration. But the
rule is likely to come under pressure as a result of developments that have taken place in
our next group of cases.
5.2.2.3
 
Performance of a Contractual Duty Owed to the
Promisor
The question whether or not performance of a pre-existing contractual duty owed to the
promisor is good consideration for an additional promise of payment made by the
promisor has proved to be a vexed one in English law. Take the following example. A
enters into a contract with B under which B agrees to build a house for A at a price of
£100,000. B finds that he cannot perform the contract for the agreed sum and informs
A that he will not be able to complete the works unless he is paid an additional £10,000.
A promises to pay the additional sum but, after the works are completed, refuses to
honour his promise. Can B recover the additional £10,000 from A? The traditional
answer is that he cannot on the ground that he has not provided any consideration for
B’s promise to pay him £10,000. He has simply performed his existing contractual duty,
owed to A, to build the house and performance 
of an existing contractual duty owed to
the promisor (here A) is not good consideration. Authority for such a proposition is to be
found in 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
(1809) 2 Camp. 317, 6 Esp 129 (
5.2.2.3.1
) and 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
(1884) 9 App Cas 605 (
5.2.2.4
), albeit that the latter case is concerned with a promise to
pay part of an existing debt. This view has, however, been challenged by the decision of
the Court of Appeal in 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB
1 (
5.2.2.3.2
) where, on facts which resemble our hypothetical example, the court held
that performance of an existing contractual duty did amount to consideration for a
promise of additional payment by the party in the position of A. The basis for this
conclusion was that A received a practical benefit as a result of the performance by B of
his existing contractual duty and, in the absence of duress, there were no public policy
objections to giving effect to A’s promise to pay B more money for the performance of
B’s existing contractual obligations.
In terms of authority the central issue at stake in the cases is the relationship between
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
 
(and now the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
MWB Business
Exchange Centres Ltd
 
v. 
Rock Advertising Ltd
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 553, [2017] QB 604, on
which see 
5.2.2.4.2
), on the one hand, and 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
and 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
on the
other hand. The relationship between 
Williams
 
and 
Foakes
 
is particularly difficult,
given that the latter is a decision of the House of Lords which was not in fact mentioned
by the Court of Appeal in their judgments in 
Williams
. In terms of principle there are
two important points at stake. The first relates to the conception of benefit or detriment
to which the court ought to have regard. If the court looks for a benefit or detriment as a
matter of law, it will struggle to find such benefit or detriment in these cases because it
is difficult to say that A has been benefited as a matter of law when all that he has
received is a performance to which he was already entitled, and it is also hard to say that
B has suffered a legal detriment in performing a duty that he was already legally obliged
to perform as a result of his contract with A. On the other hand, if attention is focused
on the existence of a ‘practical’ or ‘factual’ benefit or detriment then it can be argued that
A has received a ‘practical’ benefit in obtaining performance which he might not
otherwise have obtained, and B can be said to have suffered a ‘practical’ or ‘factual’
detriment in continuing with performance when he might have simply refused to go on
with his contractual obligations. The second issue relates to the role of duress. Is the
reason for refusing to give effect to A’s promise to pay more to B, the fact that B either
has, or may have, extracted the promise of additional payment by subjecting A to
duress? If duress is the rationale behind the cases then we should give effect to re-
negotiations of a contract provided that they are freely entered into. But if duress is not
the rationale behind the rule then the courts should refuse to give effect to A’s promise
to pay B an additional £10,000 even in the case where A freely agreed to pay B the
additional sum.
5.2.2.3.1
 
The early case law:
 
Stilk 
v.
 
Myrick
The leading case, at least in historical terms, is 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
. Unfortunately, the case
was reported twice and the two reports differ in significant respects. The facts of 
Stilk
were as follows:
The plaintiff seaman agreed to sail to the Baltic and back at a rate of pay of £5 per
month. When the vessel arrived in Cronstadt two of the seamen deserted. The master of
the vessel failed in his attempt to find two sailors to replace the deserters and so he
entered into an agreement with the rest of the crew, which included the plaintiff, under
which he agreed that if the crew worked the ship back to London he would divide the
wages of the two deserters between them in equal shares. The crew worked the ship back
to London but the master did 
not pay the plaintiff his share of the deserters’ wages. The
plaintiff brought an action against the master to recover the wages which he believed
were due to him. His claim failed.
The reasons for the failure of the plaintiff’s claim are stated differently in the two
reports. The first report was prepared by Espinasse ((1809) 6 Esp 129) and is in the
following terms:
Lord Ellenborough
 
ruled, That the plaintiff could not recover upon this part of his demand. His Lordship
said, That he recognised the principle of the case of 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
 
as founded on just and proper policy.
When the defendant entered on board the ship, he stipulated to do all the work his situation called upon him to
do. Here the voyage was to the Baltick and back, not to Cronstadt only; if the voyage had then terminated, the
sailors might have made what terms they pleased. If any part of the crew had died, would not the remainder
have been forced to work the ship home? If that accident would have left them liable to do the whole work
without any extraordinary remuneration, why should not desertion or casualty equally demand it?
Verdict for the monthly wages only.
The second report was prepared by Campbell ((1809) 2 Camp 318) and it states:
Lord Ellenborough
I think 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
 
was rightly decided; but I doubt whether the ground of public policy, upon which Lord
Kenyon is stated to have proceeded, be the true principle on which the decision is to be supported. Here, I say,
the agreement is void for want of consideration. There was no consideration for the ulterior pay promised to the
mariners who remained with the ship. Before they sailed from London they had undertaken to do all that they
could under all the emergencies of the voyage. They had sold all their services till the voyage should be
completed. If they had been at liberty to quit the vessel at Cronstadt, the case would have been quite different;
or if the captain had capriciously discharged the two men who were wanting, the others might not have been
compellable to take the whole duty upon themselves, and their agreeing to do so might have been a sufficient
consideration for the promise of an advance of wages. But the desertion of a part of the crew is to be considered
an emergency of the voyage as much as their death; and those who remain are bound by the terms of their
original contract to exert themselves to the utmost to bring the ship in safety to her destined port. Therefore,
without looking to the policy of this agreement, I think it is void for want of consideration, and that the plaintiff
can only recover at the rate of £5 per month.
Commentary
At the time at which 
Stilk
 
was decided there was no centralized system of law reporting
and the quality of the reporting was variable. The two reporters of 
Stilk
 
were Espinasse
and Campbell. It is fair to say that Espinasse was not highly regarded as a law reporter.
His standing, or lack of it, was summed up by Isaacs J when he said that he did not care
for ‘Espinasse or any other ass’! On the other hand, Espinasse was junior counsel in 
Stilk
and so one might have expected him to note down accurately what Lord Ellenborough
actually said. But Espinasse’s hearing was apparently suspect so we may not be able to
rely on his ability to record what was said accurately. Campbell, on the other hand, is an
altogether 
more powerful figure. He rose to become Lord Chancellor and his reputation
as a law reporter is much higher, although it might be said that his position as Lord
Chancellor insulated him from some of the criticisms that might otherwise have been
levelled against the quality of his reporting.
However, it is possible to exaggerate the significance of the differences between the two
reports. Indeed, Peter Luther notes (‘Campbell, Espinasse and the Sailors: Text and
Context in the Common Law’ (1999) 19 
Legal Studies
 
526) that there are substantial
similarities between the two reports of the case. Thus he states (at p. 538):
Bearing in mind that both texts must be treated with caution, it is interesting to compare the two methodically.
The surprise is not how different, but how 
similar
 
they are. The best way to do this is to take each sentence of
Espinasse’s report, as the less full version, and to find its equivalent in Campbell. To the sentence which refers
to 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
 
there is, it appears, no equivalent in Campbell; this is the crux of the case, and to this we
will return. But, except for this sentence, there is nothing in Espinasse that does not have its parallel in
Campbell. Espinasse’s following sentence, beginning ‘When the defendant … ’ makes the same point as the
sentence in Campbell which begins ‘Before they sailed from London … ’. The next sentence, ‘Here the voyage
was to the Baltick … ’, corresponds to the first part of Campbell’s ‘If they had been at liberty to quit the vessel at
Cronstadt … ’, though Campbell continues with a point omitted by Espinasse, concerning what might have
happened had the master ‘capriciously discharged the two men who were wanting’. This is, of course, not the
only point made by Campbell but ignored by Espinasse—the latter’s omission of any reference to consideration
is another point that must be considered in more detail … Espinasse’s two closing questions, beginning ‘If any
part of the crew had died … ’ and ‘If that accident would have left them liable … ’ are the equivalent of
Campbell’s single sentence beginning ‘But the desertion of the crew … ’. Leaving aside for the moment the
problem references to 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
, each report makes sense as it stands, but Espinasse has produced a
report which supports a ‘public policy’ analysis, and Campbell a report which culminates in an application of the
doctrine of consideration, 
by using identical reasoning
. A literary critic would be struck by the consonance
between the two reports, not the difference. Perhaps it is in the nature of lawyers—or at least those used to an
adversarial system—to assume that if two texts are not identical, they must be diametrically opposed; that one
must be wrong, one right.
What about the references to 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
? Surely at this point there is a direct conflict between the two
reports? It is suggested—tentatively—that it may be possible to reconcile even these two sentences. This can
only be speculation, but it is surely as valid to suggest an answer to the question ‘what did the judge mean?’
when we have two accounts (or, at least, impressions) of what he said, than it is to ask and answer the question
‘what really happened in Cronstadt?’, which is what judges and commentators have done when they suppose
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
to have been a case of coercion. Could Espinasse’s statement that Ellenborough ‘recognised the
principle of the case of 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
 
as founded on just and proper policy’ be no more than his equivalent
of Campbell’s ‘I think 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
 
was rightly decided’? Or, to put it another way and to paraphrase the
combined text of both reporters, could Ellenborough have been suggesting that Lord Kenyon’s decision in the
earlier case was indeed based on 
a
 
just and proper policy, but not on 
the
 
policy which is stated in the report of
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
? Such a construction would have the advantage of making perfect sense of Espinasse’s report,
in which the apparent approval of 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
 
otherwise looks rather odd, since there is no subsequent
reference to any of the reasoning used in the case. Espinasse, on such an analysis, makes Ellenborough give an
alternative
 
policy-based reason why he approves of the decision in 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
.
Notwithstanding the similarities noted by Luther, 
Stilk
 
has been analysed in two
different ways by commentators, and these two different analyses reflect the two reports
of the case. The first analysis is based on duress (and hence on Espinasse’s report) and
the second on consideration (based on Campbell’s report). The difference between the
two analyses is important because the latter refuses to give effect to the promise of
additional payment even in the case where no duress has been exercised.
The claim that 
Stilk
 
can be explained on the ground of duress is somewhat problematic.
The difficulties are both doctrinal and factual. The doctrinal difficulty relates to the
status of the doctrine of duress in 1809. The doctrine of duress, at least that part of it
concerned with the application of economic, as opposed to physical, coercion was in a
very undeveloped state in 1809 and indeed there are doubts as to its very existence at
that point in time (it is common to attribute the recognition of the doctrine of economic
duress in English law to Kerr J in 1976 in 
The Siboen and The Sibotre
 
[1976] 1 Lloyd’s
Rep 293). For present purposes, it suffices to concentrate on the factual difficulty. It is
important to note that the context in which the master made his promise of additional
pay was not one in which the sailors had refused mid-voyage to continue with the
journey unless they were promised extra pay. The vessel was in port at the time at which
the promise was made and so there may not have been any pressure on the master at all.
In other words, we need to know more about the facts of the case before we can be in a
position to decide whether or not this was a case of duress. There is evidence that
duress, or the fear of potential duress, may have been a factor that influenced Lord
Ellenborough. Some support for the proposition that duress does have a role to play in
understanding these cases can be gleaned from the case of 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
 
(1791) 1
Peake 102 (although note Peter Luther’s comments on 
Harris
 
extracted earlier). The
plaintiff was a seaman on board the vessel 
The Alexander
. The defendant was the
master of the vessel and he promised to pay the plaintiff five guineas over and above his
common wages if the plaintiff would perform some extra work in navigating the ship.
The promise was made at a time when the ship was in danger and it was made in order
to induce the seamen to exert themselves. Lord Kenyon held that the plaintiff was not
entitled to recover the promised five guineas. He stated (at p. 103):
If this action was to be supported, it would materially affect the navigation of this kingdom. It has been long
since determined, that when the freight is lost, the wages are also lost. This rule was founded on a principle of
policy, for if sailors were in all events to have their wages, and in times of danger entitled to insist on an extra
charge on such a promise as this, they would in many cases suffer a ship to sink, unless the captain would pay
any extravagant demand they might think proper to make.
The alternative analysis of 
Stilk
, based on Campbell’s report, was that it was a case in
which there was no consideration for the promise of extra pay. Why was there no
consideration on the facts of the case? The plaintiff in all probability had to work harder
as a result of the desertion of the two crew members and it could be argued that the
master obtained a benefit as a result of the work done by the sailors. Lord Ellenborough
addressed the detriment side of the equation but he did not comment on the benefit
issue. In rejecting the submission that the plaintiff had provided consideration as a
result of the work he had done on the voyage home, Lord Ellenborough did not focus on
the question whether, as a matter of fact, the plaintiff had worked harder. Instead he
examined the legal obligations of the plaintiff and concluded that he had not, as a matter
of law, done more than he was legally required to do. He had accepted a contractual
obligation to work the vessel to the Baltic and back and that 
was what he had done. The
absence of any discussion of whether or not the master obtained a benefit as a result of
the work done by the sailors is a matter of some significance, given the emphasis placed
by modern courts upon the question of whether or not the party in the position of the
master obtained a ‘practical benefit’ as a result of the performance of the pre-existing
duty (see further 
5.2.2.3.2.1
).
We have seen in the context of cases concerned with the performance of a duty imposed
by law (
5.2.2.2
) that the courts have recognized that a party who does more than his
legal duty does provide consideration. The same principle has been applied in the
present context. Thus in 
Hanson
 
v. 
Royden
 
(1867) LR 3 CP 47 the plaintiff did more
than he was obliged to do in that he was promoted and so performed additional tasks in
return for the promise of extra pay. Similarly, in 
Hartley
 
v. 
Ponsonby
 
(1857) 7 E & B 872
the sailors did more than they were contractually bound to do in that the ship was so
under-manned as a result of desertions that they would have been entitled to refuse to
continue with the voyage. Thus in continuing the voyage when they might lawfully have
refused to do so they provided consideration for the promise of extra pay.
The question whether 
Stilk
 
is properly analysed as a duress case or as a case in which no
consideration was provided for the defendant’s promise of additional pay resurfaced in
the case of 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 1, which is
now regarded as the leading modern authority on the point.
5.2.2.3.2
 
Modern developments:
 
Williams 
v.
 
Roffey Bros
WILLIAMS V. ROFFEY BROS & NICHOLLS
(CONTRACTORS) LTD
[1991] 1 QB 1, Court of Appeal
The defendant building contractors entered into a contract with the plaintiff
carpenter under which the plaintiff agreed to carry out the carpentry work on the
refurbishment of twenty-seven flats. The contract price for the carpentry work was
agreed at £20,000. After he had completed part of the work, and been paid
£16,200 by the defendants, the plaintiff ran into financial difficulties. The trial judge
found that there were two principal causes of his difficulties. The first was that the
contract price was too low to enable him to operate satisfactorily and make a profit.
The second was that he failed to supervise his workmen adequately. The
defendants wished to ensure that the plaintiff completed the work on time because
a failure to do so would result in them incurring liability under a ‘penalty clause’ to
the employer. The defendants called a meeting with the plaintiff and they promised
to pay him a further sum of £10,300 to be paid at the rate of £575 for each flat in
which the carpentry work was completed. The plaintiff continued with the work and
was paid a further £1,500. The plaintiff then walked off the site. The defendants
employed other contractors to finish off the work, albeit that they incurred liability
under the ‘penalty clause’ as a result of their completion of the works one week
late. The plaintiff brought a claim against the defendants for damages of
£10,847.07. The Assistant Recorder found that before he ceased work the plaintiff
had substantially completed the work on eight flats after the defendants had made
their promise of additional payment. He accordingly awarded the plaintiff damages
of £4,600 (consisting of 8 × £575) ‘less some small deduction for defective and
incomplete items’ and held that the plaintiff was entitled to a reasonable proportion
of the £2,200 outstanding from the original contract price.
The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal on two principal grounds. The
first was that they submitted that there was no consideration for their promise to
pay an additional £575 per completed flat. The second was that the money was
only payable upon completion of each flat and that, since the work had not been
completed on any flat, no payment was due. The Court of Appeal dismissed the
appeal and held that the plaintiff was entitled to be paid because he had
substantially completed the work on eight of the flats and had provided
consideration for the defendants’ promise of additional payment.
Glidewell LJ
[set out the facts, decided that substantial completion of the eight flats entitled the
plaintiff to payment and continued]
Was there consideration for the defendants’ promise made on 9 April 1986 to
pay an additional price at the rate of £575 per completed flat?
The judge made the following findings of fact which are relevant on this issue.
(i) The subcontract price agreed was too low to enable the plaintiff to operate
satisfactorily and at a profit. Mr Cottrell, the defendants’ surveyor, agreed that this
was so. (ii) Mr Roffey (managing director of the defendants) was persuaded by Mr
Cottrell that the defendants should pay a bonus to the plaintiff. The figure agreed at
the meeting on 9 April 1986 was £10,300.
The judge quoted and accepted the evidence of Mr Cottrell to the effect that a
main contractor who agrees too low a price with a subcontractor is acting contrary
to his own interests. He will never get the job finished without paying more money.
The judge therefore concluded:
‘In my view where the original subcontract price is too low, and the parties subsequently agree that
additional moneys shall be paid to the subcontractor, this agreement is in the interests of both parties.
This is what happened in the present case, and in my opinion the agreement of 9 April 1986 does not fail
for lack of consideration.’
In his address to us, Mr Evans [counsel for the defendants] outlined the benefits to
his clients, the defendants, which arose from their agreement to pay the additional
£10,300 as: (i) seeking to ensure that the plaintiff continued work and did not stop
in breach of the subcontract; (ii) avoiding the penalty for delay; and (iii) avoiding
the trouble and expense of engaging other people to complete the carpentry work.
However, Mr Evans submits that, though his clients may have derived, or
hoped to derive, practical benefits from their agreement to pay the ‘bonus’, they
derived no benefit in law, since the plaintiff was promising to do no more than he
was already bound to do by his subcontract, i.e., continue with the carpentry work
and complete it on time. Thus there was no consideration for the agreement. Mr
Evans relies on the principle of law which, traditionally, is based on the decision in
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
(1809) 2 Camp 317 …
[He set out the facts of the case and the judgment as reported by Campbell and
continued]
In 
North Ocean Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
Hyundai Construction Co Ltd
 
[1979] QB 705,
Mocatta J regarded the general principle of the decision in 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
, 2 Camp
317 as still being good law. He referred to two earlier decisions of this court,
dealing with wholly different subjects, in which Denning LJ sought to escape from
the confines of the rule, but was not accompanied in his attempt by the other
members of the court …
[He considered 
Ward
 
v. 
Byham
 
[1956] 1 WLR 496, see 
5.2.2.2
 
and, after
setting out passages from the judgments of Denning LJ and Morris LJ, stated]
As I read the judgment of Morris LJ, he and Parker LJ held that, although in
maintaining the child the plaintiff was doing no more than she was obliged to do,
nevertheless her promise that the child would be well looked after and happy was
a practical benefit to the father which amounted to consideration for his promise.
[He then considered 
Williams
 
v. 
Williams
 
[1957] 1 WLR 148, see 
5.2.2.2
 
and
continued]
It was suggested to us in argument that, since the development of the doctrine
of promissory estoppel, it may well be possible for a person to whom a promise
has been made, on which he has relied, to make an additional payment for
services which he is in any event bound to render under an existing contract or by
operation of law, to show that the promisor is estopped from claiming that there
was no consideration for his promise. However, the application of the doctrine of
promissory estoppel to facts such as those of the present case has not yet been
fully developed. … Moreover, this point was not argued in the court below, nor was
it more than adumbrated before us. Interesting though it is, no reliance can in my
view be placed on this concept in the present case.
There is, however, another legal concept of relatively recent development
which is relevant, namely, that of economic duress. Clearly if a subcontractor has
agreed to undertake work at a fixed price, and before he has completed the work
declines to continue with it unless the contractor agrees to pay an increased price,
the subcontractor may be held guilty of securing the contractor’s promise by taking
unfair advantage of the difficulties he will cause if he does not complete the work.
In such a case an agreement to pay an increased price may well be voidable
because it was entered into under duress. Thus this concept may provide another
answer in law to the question of policy which has troubled the courts since before
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
, 2 Camp 317, and no doubt led at the date of that decision to a rigid
adherence to the doctrine of consideration.
This possible application of the concept of economic duress was referred to by
Lord Scarman, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council in 
Pao On
 
v. 
Lau Yiu Long
 
[1980] AC 614. Lord Scarman … referred to
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
, 2 Camp 317, and its predecessor 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
 
(1791) Peake
102, and to 
Williams
 
v. 
Williams
 
[1957] 1 WLR 148, before turning to the
development of this branch of the law in the United States of America. He then
said, at pp. 634–635:
‘Their Lordships’ knowledge of this developing branch of American law is necessarily limited. In their
judgment it would be carrying audacity to the point of foolhardiness for them to attempt to extract from
the American case-law a principle to provide an answer to the question now under consideration. That
question, their Lordships repeat, is whether, in a case where duress is not established, public policy may
nevertheless invalidate the consideration if there has been a threat to repudiate a pre-existing
contractual obligation or an unfair use of a dominating bargaining position. Their Lordships’ conclusion is
that where businessmen are negotiating at arm’s length it is unnecessary for the achievement of justice,
and unhelpful in the development of the law, to invoke such a rule of public policy. It would also create
unacceptable anomaly. It is unnecessary because justice requires that men, who have negotiated at
arm’s length, be held to their bargains unless it can be shown that their consent was vitiated by fraud,
mistake or duress. If a promise is induced by coercion of a man’s will, the doctrine of duress suffices to
do justice. The party coerced, if he chooses and acts in time, can avoid the contract. If there is no
coercion, there can be no reason for avoiding the contract where there is shown to be a real
consideration which is otherwise legal. Such a rule of public policy as is now being considered would be
unhelpful because it would render the law uncertain. It would become a question of fact and degree to
determine in each case whether there had 
been, short of duress, an unfair use of a strong bargaining
position. It would create anomaly because, if public policy invalidates the consideration, the effect is to
make the contract void. But unless the facts are such as to support a plea of “non est factum”, which is
not suggested in this case, duress does no more than confer upon the victim the opportunity, if taken in
time, to avoid the contract. It would be strange if conduct less than duress could render a contract void,
whereas duress does no more than render a contract voidable … ’
It is true that 
Pao On
 
is a case of a tripartite relationship that is, a promise by A to
perform a pre-existing contractual obligation owed to B, in return for a promise of
payment by C. But Lord Scarman’s words, at pp. 634–635, seem to me to be of
general application, equally applicable to a promise made by one of the original
two parties to a contract.
Accordingly, following the view of the majority in 
Ward
 
v. 
Byham
 
[1956] 1 WLR
496 and of the whole court in 
Williams
 
v. 
Williams
 
[1957] 1 WLR 148 and that of
the Privy Council in 
Pao On
 
[1980] AC 614 the present state of the law on this
subject can be expressed in the following proposition: (i) if A has entered into a
contract with B to do work for, or to supply goods or services to, B in return for
payment by B; and (ii) at some stage before A has completely performed his
obligations under the contract B has reason to doubt whether A will, or will be able
to, complete his side of the bargain; and (iii) B thereupon promises A an additional
payment in return for A’s promise to perform his contractual obligations on time;
and (iv) as a result of giving his promise, B obtains in practice a benefit, or
obviates a disbenefit; and (v) B’s promise is not given as a result of economic
duress or fraud on the part of A; then (vi) the benefit to B is capable of being
consideration for B’s promise, so that the promise will be legally binding.
As I have said, Mr Evans accepts that in the present case by promising to pay
the extra £10,300 his client secured benefits. There is no finding, and no
suggestion, that in this case the promise was given as a result of fraud or duress. If
it be objected that the propositions above contravene the principle in 
Stilk
 
v.
Myrick
, 2 Camp 317, I answer that in my view they do not; they refine, and limit the
application of that principle, but they leave the principle unscathed e.g. where B
secures no benefit by his promise. It is not in my view surprising that a principle
enunciated in relation to the rigours of seafaring life during the Napoleonic wars
should be subjected during the succeeding 180 years to a process of refinement
and limitation in its application in the present day. It is therefore my opinion that on
his findings of fact in the present case, the judge was entitled to hold, as he did,
that the defendants’ promise to pay the extra £10,300 was supported by valuable
consideration, and thus constituted an enforceable agreement …
For these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.
Russell LJ
I find [the] primary argument relating to consideration much more difficult. It is
worth rehearsing some of the facts …
[He set out an extract from the defendants’ pleading and continued]
There is no hint in that pleading that the defendants were subjected to any
duress to make the agreement or that their promise to pay the extra £10,300
lacked consideration. As the judge found, the plaintiff must have continued work in
the belief that he would be paid £575 as he finished each of the 18 uncompleted
flats (although the arithmetic is not precisely accurate). For their part the
defendants recorded the new terms in their ledger. Can the defendants now
escape liability on the ground that the plaintiff undertook to do no more than he 
had
originally contracted to do although, quite clearly, the defendants, on 9 April 1986,
were prepared to make the payment and only declined to do so at a later stage? It
would certainly be unconscionable if this were to be their legal entitlement.
The submissions advanced on both sides before this court ranged over a wide
field. They went far beyond the pleadings, and indeed it is worth noticing that the
absence of consideration was never pleaded, although argued before the assistant
recorder, Mr Rupert Jackson QC. Speaking for myself—and I notice it is touched
upon in the judgment of Glidewell LJ—I would have welcomed the development of
argument, if it could have been properly raised in this court, on the basis that there
was here an estoppel and that the defendants, in the circumstances prevailing,
were precluded from raising the defence that their undertaking to pay the extra
£10,300 was not binding … whilst consideration remains a fundamental
requirement before a contract not under seal can be enforced, the policy of the law
in its search to do justice between the parties has developed considerably since
the early 19th century when 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
, 2 Camp 317 was decided by Lord
Ellenborough CJ. In the late 20th century I do not believe that the rigid approach to
the concept of consideration to be found in 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
is either necessary or
desirable. Consideration there must still be but, in my judgment, the courts
nowadays should be more ready to find its existence so as to reflect the intention
of the parties to the contract where the bargaining powers are not unequal and
where the finding of consideration reflects the true intention of the parties.
What was the true intention of the parties when they arrived at the agreement
pleaded by the defendants … ? The plaintiff had got into financial difficulties. The
defendants, through their employee Mr Cottrell, recognised the price that had been
agreed originally with the plaintiff was less than what Mr Cottrell himself regarded
as a reasonable price. There was a desire on Mr Cottrell’s part to retain the
services of the plaintiff so that the work could be completed without the need to
employ another subcontractor. There was further a need to replace what had
hitherto been a haphazard method of payment by a more formalised scheme
involving the payment of a specified sum on the completion of each flat. These
were all advantages accruing to the defendants which can fairly be said to have
been in consideration of their undertaking to pay the additional £10,300. True it
was that the plaintiff did not undertake to do any work additional to that which he
had originally undertaken to do but the terms upon which he was to carry out the
work were varied and, in my judgment, that variation was supported by
consideration which a pragmatic approach to the true relationship between the
parties readily demonstrates.
For my part I wish to make it plain that I do not base my judgment upon any
reservation as to the correctness of the law long ago enunciated in 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
.
A gratuitous promise, pure and simple, remains unenforceable unless given under
seal. But where, as in this case, a party undertakes to make a payment because
by so doing it will gain an advantage arising out of the continuing relationship with
the promisee the new bargain will not fail for want of consideration. As I read the
judgment of the assistant recorder this was his true ratio upon that part of the case
wherein the absence of consideration was raised in argument. For the reasons that
I have endeavoured to outline, I think that the assistant recorder came to a correct
conclusion and I too would dismiss this appeal.
Purchas LJ
[set out the facts and continued]
The point of some difficulty which arises on this appeal is whether the judge
was correct in his conclusion that the agreement reached on 9 April did not fail for
lack of consideration 
because the principle established by the old cases of 
Stilk
 
v.
Myrick
, 2 Camp 317 approving 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
, Peake 102 did not apply. Mr
Makey, who appeared for the plaintiff, was bold enough to submit that 
Harris
 
v.
Watson
, albeit a decision of Lord Kenyon, was a case tried at the Guildhall at nisi
prius in the Court of King’s Bench and that 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
was a decision also at
nisi prius albeit a judgment of no less a judge than Lord Ellenborough CJ and that,
therefore, this court was bound by neither authority. I feel I must say at once that,
for my part, I would not be prepared to overrule two cases of such veneration
involving judgments of judges of such distinction except on the strongest possible
grounds since they form a pillar stone of the law of contract which has been
observed over the years and is still recognised in principle in recent authority: see
the reference to 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
to be found in 
North Ocean Shipping Co Ltd
 
v.
Hyundai Construction Co Ltd
 
[1979] QB 705, 712 per Mocatta J. With respect, I
agree with his view of the two judgments by Denning LJ in 
Ward
 
v. 
Byham
 
[1956] 1
WLR 496 and 
Williams
 
v. 
Williams
 
[1957] 1 WLR 148 in concluding that these
judgments do not provide a sound basis for avoiding the rule in 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
, 2
Camp 317. Although this rule has been the subject of some criticism it is still
clearly recognised in current textbooks of authority: see 
Chitty on Contracts
, 28th
ed. (1989) and Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s 
Law of Contract
, 11th ed. (1986).
By the same token I find myself unable to accept the attractive invitation … to
follow the decision of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire in 
Watkins and Sons
Inc
 
v. 
Carrig
 
(1941) 21 A. 2d 591.
In my judgment, therefore, the rule in 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
, 2 Camp 317 remains valid
as a matter of principle, namely that a contract not under seal must be supported
by consideration. Thus, where the agreement upon which reliance is placed
provides that an extra payment is to be made for work to be done by the payee
which he is already obliged to perform then unless some other consideration is
detected to support the agreement to pay the extra sum that agreement will not be
enforceable. The two cases, 
Harris
 
v. 
Watson
, Peake 102 and 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
, 2
Camp 317 involved circumstances of a very special nature, namely the
extraordinary conditions existing at the turn of the 18th century under which
seamen had to serve their contracts of employment on the high seas. There were
strong public policy grounds at that time to protect the master and owners of a ship
from being held to ransom by disaffected crews. Thus, the decision that the
promise to pay extra wages even in the circumstances established in those cases,
was not supported by consideration is readily understandable. Of course,
conditions today on the high seas have changed dramatically and it is at least
questionable … whether these cases might not well have been decided differently
if they were tried today. The modern cases tend to depend more upon the defence
of duress in a commercial context rather than lack of consideration for the second
agreement. In the present case the question of duress does not arise. The initiative
in coming to the agreement of 9 April came from Mr Cottrell and not from the
plaintiff. It would not, therefore, lie in the defendants’ mouth to assert a defence of
duress. Nevertheless, the court is more ready in the presence of this defence
being available in the commercial context to look for mutual advantages which
would amount to sufficient consideration to support the second agreement under
which the extra money is paid …
In the light of those authorities the question now must be addressed: Was there
evidence upon which the judge was entitled to find that there was sufficient
consideration to support the agreement of 9 April … what consideration has moved
from the plaintiff to support the promise to pay the extra £10,300 added to the lump
sum provision? In the particular circumstances which I have outlined above, there
was clearly a commercial advantage to both sides from a pragmatic point of view
in reaching the agreement of 9 April. The defendants were on risk that as a result
of the bargain they had struck the plaintiff 
would not or indeed possibly could not
comply with his existing obligations without further finance. As a result of the
agreement the defendants secured their position commercially. There was,
however, no obligation added to the contractual duties imposed upon the plaintiff
under the original contract. Prima facie this would appear to be a classic 
Stilk
 
v.
Myrick
 
case. It was, however, open to the plaintiff to be in deliberate breach of the
contract in order to ‘cut his losses’ commercially. In normal circumstances the
suggestion that a contracting party can rely upon his own breach to establish
consideration is distinctly unattractive. In many cases it obviously would be and if
there was any element of duress brought upon the other contracting party under
the modern development of this branch of the law the proposed breaker of the
contract would not benefit. With some hesitation … I consider that the modern
approach to the question of consideration would be that where there were benefits
derived by each party to a contract of variation even though one party did not
suffer a detriment this would not be fatal to the establishing of sufficient
consideration to support the agreement. If both parties benefit from an agreement
it is not necessary that each also suffers a detriment. In my judgment, on the facts
as found by the judge, he was entitled to reach the conclusion that consideration
existed and in those circumstances I would not disturb that finding. … For these
reasons and for the reasons which have already been given by Glidewell LJ I
would dismiss this appeal.
Commentary
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
 
is a leading modern case on the doctrine of consideration. It has
attracted a huge amount of academic commentary but its impact on the world of
practice seems relatively small; the case has not been cited extensively. But this may
simply reflect the point that has already been made, namely the limited practical
significance of the doctrine of consideration. Eight points fall to be made in relation to
the scope of the case.
5.2.2.3.2.1
 
Identifying the practical benefit
The first relates to the basis for the finding that the plaintiff provided consideration for
the defendants’ promise to pay an extra £10,300. All three judges emphasized the fact
that the defendants obtained a ‘practical benefit’ as a result of the plaintiff’s promise to
perform his existing contractual duty. What was this ‘practical benefit’? Various
explanations were offered by the judges in 
Williams
. Check back through the judgments
and try to identify as many as you can. At one end of the spectrum is the observation of
Purchas LJ that the plaintiff could be said to have provided consideration in that he did
not break his contract with the defendants. This is a controversial statement in that it
gives little or no emphasis to the fact that the defendants had purchased the right to the
plaintiff’s performance under the original contract. While they may have obtained a
practical benefit in the sense that the plaintiff continued with performance when he
might not otherwise have done so, they were already entitled to that performance as a
matter of law so that, in the eyes of the law, it can be said that they did not obtain a
benefit as a result of the performance by the plaintiff of his existing contractual duty. At
the other end of the spectrum is the point made by Russell LJ that a ‘haphazard method
of payment’ was replaced by a more formalized payment system which gave the
defendants greater control over the order of the plaintiff’s performance. 
The latter does
seem to amount to the provision of consideration and so the case was probably correctly
decided on its own facts. It is the wider dicta which suggest that the plaintiff provided
consideration merely by continuing with the work and not breaching his contract that
are problematic.
But it may be that these wider dicta will not be followed. Thus in 
WRN Ltd
 
v. 
Ayris
[2008] EWHC 1080 (QB), [2008] All ER (D) 276 (May), [46] Judge Seymour stated that
it was ‘well-established’ that a promise to perform an existing contract ‘will not, in law,
constitute consideration’. Slightly more equivocal is the decision of the Court of Appeal
in 
Attrill
 
v. 
Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd
 
[2011] EWCA Civ 229, [2011] IRLR 613, where an
employer undertook to establish a guaranteed minimum bonus pool for certain
employees. The employer subsequently maintained that the promise was unsupported
by consideration. The Court of Appeal concluded (at [35]) that ‘the continued work of
the employee is, at least arguably, adequate consideration for the establishment of the
guaranteed minimum bonus pool’. Two aspects of this decision should be noted. First, it
was not necessary for the Court of Appeal to reach a final view on the matter; hence it
was sufficient to conclude that it was ‘arguable’ that the employees had provided
consideration. Secondly, the scheme was part of a retention package, so that the benefit
to the employer was not simply that the employees would continue to perform their
existing contractual obligations, but that they would not exercise their right to terminate
their employment in order to seek better terms elsewhere at a time when the employer
had particular need of their services (as indicated by Elias LJ at a subsequent stage of
the litigation in 
Attrill
 
v. 
Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 394, [2013] 3 All ER
607, [95]). On the other hand, Leggatt J in 
Blue
 
v. 
Ashley
 
[2017] EWHC 1928 (Comm),
[59], stated that the decision in 
Williams
 
had ‘effectively’ rendered the rule that
performance of, or a promise to perform, an existing contractual duty could not
constitute consideration ‘obsolete by accepting that performance or a promise to
perform an existing duty can satisfy the requirement of consideration by providing a
practical benefit to the other party, which it will invariably do’.
5.2.2.3.2.2
 
The relationship between
 
Williams 
and
 
Stilk 
v.
 
Myrick
The second point concerns the relationship between 
Williams
 
and 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
. All
three judges discuss 
Stilk
 
but they do not overrule it. Thus the six propositions set out by
Glidewell LJ (
5.2.2.3.2
) are said to ‘refine’ and ‘limit’ the application of the principle laid
down in 
Stilk
 
but they do not ‘contravene’ it. Rather oddly, all three judges cite
Campbell’s report of 
Stilk
 
but their interpretation of the case is much closer to
Espinasse’s version of it. This suggests that the difference between 
Stilk
 
and 
Williams
lies in the absence of duress, or the potential for duress, in the latter case. But there is
another possible explanation for the difference between the two cases. The emphasis on
‘practical benefit’ in 
Williams
 
finds no counterpart in 
Stilk
. What would have been the
outcome in 
Stilk
 
if Lord Ellenborough had asked himself the question whether the
master of the ship had obtained a practical benefit as a result of the performance by the
plaintiff of his contractual obligation to work the ship back home? We shall never know
the answer to this question but it is important to bear in mind that, post 
Williams
 
v.
Roffey Bros
, there are two possible analyses of 
Stilk
. The first is that the plaintiff did
provide consideration for the master’s promise of additional pay but that the agreement
was set aside on the ground of duress (or on the ground that it was contrary to public
policy). The second explanation is that the plaintiff did not in fact provide any
consideration in promising to carry out his existing contractual obligation. Which
interpretation of 
Stilk
 
did the judges in 
Williams
 
adopt? The answer is not clear. But in
Anangel Atlas Compania Naviera SA
 
v. 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co
Ltd (No 2)
 
[1990] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 526 Hirst J appeared to adopt the latter interpretation.
Thus he said (at p. 545) that:
the ratio of 
Williams’
 
case is that, whoever provides the services, where there is a practical conferment of benefit
or a practical avoidance of disbenefit for the promisee, there is good consideration, and it is no answer to say
that the promisor was already bound; where, on the other hand, there is a wholly gratuitous promise 
Stilk’s
 
case
still remains good law.
5.2.2.3.2.3
 
Duress
The third point relates to the role of duress. The point can be put more widely. Thus in
Antons Trawling Co Ltd
 
v. 
Smith
 
[2003] 2 NZLR 23 Baragwanath J referred more
broadly to the principle that parties should be bound by their agreement to vary their
contract in the absence of ‘policy reasons to the contrary’. These ‘policy factors’ are
nowhere identified in the judgment of Baragwanath J but they are presumably doctrines
that are related to duress, such as undue influence (on which see 
Chapter 19
) and, in so
far as they are recognized as vitiating factors, unconscionability and inequality of
bargaining power (on which see 
Chapter 20
). But the essential point to grasp is the
argument that the real fear in contract modification cases is that one party will exploit
the vulnerability of the other in order to extract a promise of more pay. On this view
there is a fundamental distinction to be drawn between a modification that is freely
negotiated (which should be enforceable) and a modification extracted as a result of the
application of illegitimate pressure (which should not be enforceable). If the concern of
the law is to ensure that contract modifications are freely negotiated, then duress rather
than consideration should be the regulator of contract modifications or re-negotiations.
This point was made by Posner CJ in 
United States
 
v. 
Stump Homes Specialties
Manufacturing Inc
 
905 F 2d 1117 (1990) in the following passage from his judgment (at
pp. 1121–1122):
The requirement of consideration has … a distinct function in the modification setting—although one it does not
perform well—and that is to prevent coercive modifications. Since one of the main purposes of contracts and of
contract law is to facilitate long-term commitments, there is often an interval in the life of a contract during
which one party is at the mercy of the other. A may have ordered a machine from B that A wants to place in
operation on a given date, specified in their contract; and in expectation of B’s complying with the contract, A
may have made commitments to his customers that it would be costly to renege on. As the date of scheduled
delivery approaches, B may be tempted to demand that A agree to renegotiate the contract price, knowing that
A will incur heavy expenses if B fails to deliver on time. A can always refuse to renegotiate, relying instead on his
right to sue B for breach of contract if B fails to make delivery by the agreed date. But legal remedies are costly
and uncertain, thereby opening the way to duress. Considerations of commercial reputation will deter taking
advantage of an opportunity to exert duress on a contract partner in many cases, but not in all.
[He cited a number of examples of duress in the contract-modification setting and continued]
The rule that modifications are unenforceable unless supported by consideration strengthens A’s position by
reducing B’s incentive to seek a modification. But it strengthens 
it feebly. … The law does not require that
consideration be adequate—that it be commensurate with what the party accepting it is giving up. Slight
consideration, therefore, will suffice to make a contract or a contract modification enforceable. … And slight
consideration is consistent with coercion. To surrender one’s contractual rights in exchange for a peppercorn is
not functionally different from surrendering them for nothing.
The sensible course would be to enforce contract modifications (at least if written) regardless of
consideration and rely on the defense of duress to prevent abuse. … All coercive modifications would then be
unenforceable, and there would be no need to worry about consideration, an inadequate safeguard against
duress.
A similar judicial sentiment has been expressed on this side of the Atlantic (see, for
example, Leggatt J in 
Blue
 
v. 
Ashley
 
[2017] EWHC 1928 (Comm), [59]). Thus in 
The
Alev
 
[1989] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 138, 147 Hobhouse J stated that:
now that there is a properly developed doctrine of the avoidance of contracts on the grounds of economic
duress, there is no warrant for the Court to fail to recognise the existence of some consideration even though it
may be insignificant and even though there may have been no mutual bargain in any realistic use of that phrase.
The adoption of a duress-based analysis does have significant implications for the
doctrine of consideration because it usually carries with it the proposition either that the
court should be readier to find the existence of consideration (the view taken by
Hobhouse J) or that the court should take the bolder step, suggested by Posner CJ, of
abolishing the requirement that contract modifications be supported by consideration.
Should English law take the latter step? 
Williams
 
itself does not take it. It retains the
consideration requirement, albeit that it makes it much easier for the court to find the
existence of consideration in the context of a re-negotiation of a contract. The answer to
the question whether or not English law should abolish the consideration requirement
in relation to contract modifications depends in large part upon whether consideration
is seen as a once-for-all requirement in English law; that is to say it should apply only at
the moment of formation of the contract and not subsequently. But is there a difference
between a promise to make a gift of £1,000 and a promise to pay an extra £1,000 for
something to which one is already contractually entitled? The latter could be said to be a
form of gift that should be treated in exactly the same way as all other promises to make
a gift. On the other hand, as Posner CJ points out, the parties in a modification case
have already made a contract ‘so that the danger of mistaking casual promissory
language for an intention to be legally bound is slight’. Yet there are difficulties with the
view that consideration should no longer apply to contract modifications (these
difficulties were examined by the Singapore Court of Appeal in 
Ma Hongjin
 
v. 
SCP
Holdings Pte Ltd
 
[2020] SGCA 106, [54]–[95] where the court rejected the submission
that ‘the requirement for consideration should be dispensed with for contractual
variations’). Perhaps the most pressing difficulty relates to the current state of the
doctrine of duress (on which see further 
Chapter 18
). The doctrine does not, as yet,
exhibit a great deal of stability and, as 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
demonstrates (see 
5.2.2.3.1
), it can
be a difficult task to ascertain whether or not duress has been applied on the facts of a
particular case. The doctrine of duress may not be ready for an exalted role as the
principal regulator of contract modifications.
5.2.2.3.2.4
 
One contract or two?
The fourth point relates to the reference by Purchas LJ (see 
5.2.2.3.2
) to the American
case of 
Watkins and Sons Inc
 
v. 
Carrig
 
(1941) 21 A 2d 591. In that case the court held
that there had not been a variation of the initial contract but a consensual abandonment
of that contract which was then replaced by a second contract on new terms. In this way
the court was able to find that the abandonment of the contract and the entry into a new
contract was supported by consideration. 
Watkins
 
has been applied by the Court of
Appeal in 
Compagnie Noga d’Importation et d’Exportation SA
 
v. 
Abacha (No 2)
 
[2003]
EWCA Civ 1100, [2003] 2 All ER (Comm) 915. Tuckey LJ stated (at [57]–[60]):
The essential difference between rescission and variation for present purposes is that a contract comes to an
end when it is rescinded but continues if it is varied. If the rescinded agreement is replaced by a new agreement
containing the same obligations, it is not the old agreement which compels the performance of those obligations
but the new agreement. It follows that the principle in 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
has no application to this situation
because it is premised on the continuation of the obligations in the old agreement. Mr Flint [counsel for the
defendant] accepted this analysis in a case where there was an interval between the rescission and replacement,
but I do not see that there can be any difference in principle between the two situations. … It is not necessary in
my judgment to create a scintilla temporis [a moment in time] for there to be a rescission and replacement. It
can be achieved concurrently by the same document in the way it was done in this case.
Thus, had the court in 
Stilk
 
decided that the original contract had been abandoned and
replaced by a new contract, it would have found that the sailors were entitled to the
additional pay because, in such a case, the agreement to abandon the original contract
would have been supported by consideration and, equally, the new contract entered into
between the parties would have been supported by consideration. The distinction
between a rescission of the original contract (and its replacement with a new contract)
and the variation of that contract may be difficult to draw on the evidence but it is an
important one in terms of the legal consequences which flow from it.
5.2.2.3.2.5
 
Estoppel
The fifth point relates to the role of estoppel. All three judges in 
Williams
 
make
reference to estoppel cases and Russell LJ stated that he would have welcomed the
development of an argument to the effect that the defendants were estopped from taking
the position that their promise to pay an extra £10,300 was not binding. Estoppel will be
discussed in greater detail later in the chapter (see 
5.3
). Here it suffices to note that it
was not in fact necessary for the plaintiff to place reliance upon estoppel because he
succeeded with his primary submission that he had provided consideration for the
defendants’ promise of additional payment. A claimant who can establish the existence
of consideration does not need to invoke an estoppel. Indeed, the wider the scope of the
doctrine of consideration, the less need there is in practice to have resort to estoppel.
Conversely, the narrower the scope of the doctrine of consideration, the greater the
potential role for estoppel.
5.2.2.3.2.6
 
Analogies with other pre-existing duty cases
The sixth point relates to the willingness of the judges in 
Williams
 
to draw on case-law
concerned with the performance of a duty imposed by law and the performance of a
contractual 
duty owed to a third party. In relation to a duty imposed by law, it is
interesting to note Glidewell LJ’s analysis of 
Ward
 
v. 
Byham
 
[1956] 1 WLR 496
(
5.2.2.2
). He analysed 
Ward
 
as a case in which the consideration was to be found in the
fact that the father obtained a ‘practical benefit’ as a result of the mother’s promise that
the child would be well looked after and happy. The effect of the ‘practical benefit’
analysis is to shift attention away from the mother and the question whether or not she
had simply performed her existing legal duty. Instead it focuses attention on the father
and suggests that the question which the court should ask itself is whether or not the
promise to perform, or the performance of, a pre-existing legal duty confers a ‘practical
benefit’ upon the other party. But this analysis may go too far. Suppose that in
Glasbrook Brothers Ltd
 
v. 
Glamorgan County Council
 
[1925] AC 270 (
5.2.2.2
) the
House of Lords had concluded that the police had done no more than their legal duty in
providing a garrison for the colliery owners. Would they nevertheless have been entitled
to charge the colliery owners for the service they had provided on the basis that the
colliery owners had obtained a ‘practical benefit’ as a result of the performance of their
legal duty? The adoption of a ‘practical benefit’ test in the context of the legal duty cases
could largely undermine the general rule that performance of, or a promise to perform, a
legal duty does not constitute consideration for a promise given in return.
Of greater interest perhaps is the fact that Glidewell LJ drew considerable support for
his analysis from 
Pao On
 
v. 
Lau Yiu Long
 
[1980] AC 614, a case concerned with a
promise to perform a contractual duty owed to a third party. This reliance on 
Pao On
has, however, been criticized. In 
South Caribbean Trading Ltd
 
v. 
Trafigura Beheer BV
[2004] EWHC 2676 (Comm), [2005] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 128, Colman J stated (at [108]):
But for the fact that 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros.
 
was a decision of the Court of Appeal, I would not have followed it.
That decision is inconsistent with the long-standing rule that consideration, being the price of the promise sued
upon, must move from the promisee. The judgment of Lord Justice Glidewell was substantially based on 
Pao
On
 
v. 
Lau Yiu Long
 
[1980] AC 614 in which the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had held a promise by
A to B to perform a contractual obligation owed by A to X could be sufficient consideration as against B. At p. 15
Lord Justice Glidewell regarded Lord Scarman’s reasoning in relation to such tripartite relationship as
applicable in principle to a bipartite relationship. But in the former case by the additional promise to B,
consideration has moved from A because he has made himself liable to an additional party, whereas in the latter
case he has not undertaken anything that he was not already obliged to do for the benefit of the same party.
Lord Justice Glidewell substituted for the established rule as to consideration moving from the promisee a
completely different principle—that the promisor must by his promise have conferred a benefit on the other
party. Lord Justice Purchas at pp. 22–23 clearly saw the 
non sequitur
 
but was comforted by observations from
Lord Hailsham, LC in 
Woodhouse AC Israel Cocoa Ltd
 
v. 
Nigerian Product Marketing Co Ltd
 
[1972] AC 741 at
pp. 757–758. Investigation of the correspondence referred to in those observations shows that the latter are not
authority for the proposition advanced with some hesitation by Lord Justice Purchas.
In essence Colman J believes that a distinction must be drawn between two-party and
three-party cases and that Glidewell LJ erred in 
Williams
 
in so far as he attempted to
transplant the principles applicable in a three-party case into a two-party case. The
answer to this criticism may be that the promisee in 
Williams
 
(the sub-contractor) did
provide consideration for the promise of additional payment in that he continued with
performance of the contract when he might not otherwise have done so. In this sense,
consideration did move from the 
promisee in 
Williams.
 
However, it would appear that
the consideration for which Colman J was looking was consideration in a legal and not a
practical form. Thus the consideration which he identified in the three-party case was
the assumption of an additional legal liability by A towards B. He then noted that no
such additional legal liability was present in the two-party case and so concluded that
Williams
 
was inconsistent with the rule that consideration must move from the
promisee. The difficulty with this reasoning is that it overlooks the fact that the essence
of 
Williams
 
is to shift the focus of attention from the existence or otherwise of a legal
benefit or detriment towards an approach which focuses attention on the existence or
otherwise of a 
practical
 
benefit or detriment. This ultimately takes us back to the
distinction between legal and practical benefits and suggests that Colman J is firmly
entrenched in the legal benefit/detriment school and that this in large part explains his
criticisms of 
Williams.
5.2.2.3.2.7
 
The measure of recovery
The seventh point relates to the measure of the plaintiff’s recovery. As Professor Treitel
has pointed out (
Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract Law
 
(Oxford
University Press, 2002), p. 19), ‘the reason for the exact amount of the recovery cannot
be deduced from the figures given in the report’. The plaintiff claimed damages of
£10,847 but was awarded only £3,500. Damages were calculated by reference to the
work done by the plaintiff at the date of the termination of the contract: he was not
awarded anything for the loss of profit on the flats he would have finished had the
defendants performed their obligations in accordance with the contract. However, it
may be possible to explain this result. Professor Chen-Wishart has argued (‘A Bird in the
Hand: Consideration and Contract Modifications’ in A Burrows and E Peel (eds),
Contract Formation and Parties
 
(Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 89, 96) that
Williams
 
can best be explained as a case in which the original bilateral contract between
the parties was supplemented by ‘a collateral unilateral contract to pay more … if actual
performance is rendered’. On this view the defendant was not purchasing the right to
performance (as it had already purchased that right) but was bargaining for actual
performance. This explanation rests on the proposition that ‘contract law should
concede that obtaining actual performance will often be more valuable than simply
having the right to sue for non-performance’. Applied to the facts of 
Williams
, it
produces the result that the defendant promised to pay ‘an extra £575, if and when [the
plaintiff] finishes each of the 18 remaining flats on time’ so that the plaintiff was only
entitled to payment in respect of the flats that had been finished on time. The conclusion
that the defendant made ‘18 separate unilateral offers’ does not fit with the reasoning of
the Court of Appeal in 
Williams
 
and it would probably require some explanation before
it was understood by the parties to the litigation, but it does provide an explanation for
the case which is consistent with legal principle and which avoids the conclusion that
the plaintiff provided consideration simply by promising to do something he had already
promised to do (and it also finds support from the judgment of Arden LJ in 
MWB
Business Exchange Centres Ltd
 
v. 
Rock Advertising Ltd
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 553, [2017]
QB 604, [89]–[90], on which see further

).
5.2.2.3.2.8
 
The relationship between
 
Williams 
and
 
Foakes 
v.
 
Beer
The final point relates to the relationship between 
Williams
 
and the decision of the
House of Lords in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
(1884) 9 App Cas 605. The relationship between these
two cases is the subject matter of the next section.
5.2.2.4
 
Part Payment of a Debt
The final aspect of the pre-existing duty rule is the general rule that payment of part of a
debt is not good consideration for a promise to discharge the entire debt. The leading
case on this general rule is:
FOAKES V. BEER
(1884) 9 App Cas 605, House of Lords
In August 1875 the respondent, Mrs Beer, obtained a judgment against the
appellant, Dr Foakes, for the sum of £2,090 19s. Mrs Beer was entitled to interest
on the judgment debt at 4 per cent, arising immediately on the entering of the
judgment, until the judgment debt was fully paid. Dr Foakes asked Mrs Beer for
more time to pay the debt and so in December 1876 the parties entered into an
agreement. The agreement was drawn up by Dr Foakes’ solicitor and it recited
that:
‘Whereas the said John Weston Foakes is indebted to the said Julia Beer, and she has obtained a
judgment in Her Majesty’s High Court of Justice, Exchequer Division, for the sum of £2090 19s. And
whereas the said John Weston Foakes has requested the said Julia Beer to give him time in which to
pay such judgment, which she has agreed to do on the following conditions. Now this agreement
witnesseth that in consideration of the said John Weston Foakes paying to the said Julia Beer on the
signing of this agreement the sum of £500, the receipt whereof she doth hereby acknowledge in part
satisfaction of the said judgment debt of £2090 19s., and on condition of his paying to her or her
executors, administrators, assigns or nominee the sum of £150 on the 1st day of July and the 1st day of
January or within one calendar month after each of the said days respectively in every year until the
whole of the said sum of £2090 19s. shall have been fully paid and satisfied, the first of such payments
to be made on the 1st day of July next, then she the said Julia Beer hereby undertakes and agrees that
she, her executors, administrators or assigns, will not take any proceedings whatever on the said
judgment.’
In 1882 Mrs Beer sought to recover interest on the judgment debt (Dr Foakes
having paid to Mrs Beer the sum of £2,090 19s by instalments). Dr Foakes denied
that he was liable to pay interest and relied for this purpose on the terms of the
agreement. At trial Dr Foakes was successful but the Court of Appeal allowed Mrs
Beer’s appeal and held that the agreement was no bar to her claim. Two points
were in issue before the House of Lords. The first was whether, as a matter of
construction, Mrs Beer had agreed to forego her claim to interest on the judgment
debt and the second was whether, if she had, that agreement was supported by
consideration. The four judges in the House of Lords divided on the question of
construction but were unanimous (subject to the doubts of Lord Blackburn) that the
agreement was not supported by consideration and that Mrs Beer was entitled to
recover interest on the judgment debt.
Earl of Selborne LC
[considered the meaning of the agreement and concluded that Mrs Beer had
relinquished her claim to interest on the judgment debt and continued]
But the question remains, whether the agreement is capable of being legally
enforced. Not being under seal, it cannot be legally enforced against the
respondent, unless she received consideration for it from the appellant, or unless,
though without consideration, it operates by way of accord and satisfaction, so as
to extinguish the claim for interest. What is the consideration? On the face of the
agreement none is expressed, except a present payment of £500, on account and
in part of the larger debt then due and payable by law under the judgment. The
appellant did not contract to pay the future instalments of £150 each, at the times
therein mentioned; much less did he give any new security, in the shape of
negotiable paper, or in any other form. The promise de futuro was only that of the
respondent, that if the half-yearly payments of £150 each were regularly paid, she
would ‘take no proceedings whatever on the judgment’. No doubt if the appellant
had been under no antecedent obligation to pay the whole debt, his fulfilment of
the condition might have imported some consideration on his part for that promise.
But he was under that antecedent obligation; and payment at those deferred dates,
by the forbearance and indulgence of the creditor, of the residue of the principal
debt and costs, could not (in my opinion) be a consideration for the relinquishment
of interest and discharge of the judgment, unless the payment of the £500, at the
time of signing the agreement, was such a consideration …
The question, therefore, is nakedly raised by this appeal, whether your
Lordships are now prepared, not only to overrule, as contrary to law, the doctrine
stated by Sir Edward Coke to have been laid down by all the judges of the
Common Pleas in 
Pinnel’s Case
 
5 Rep. 117a in 1602, and repeated in his note to
Littleton, sect. 344 (2), but to treat a prospective agreement, not under seal, for
satisfaction of a debt, by a series of payments on account to a total amount less
than the whole debt, as binding in law, provided those payments are regularly
made; the case not being one of a composition with a common debtor, agreed to,
inter se, by several creditors. … The doctrine itself, as laid down by Sir Edward
Coke, may have been criticised, as questionable in principle, by some persons
whose opinions are entitled to respect, but it has never been judicially overruled;
on the contrary I think it has always, since the sixteenth century, been accepted as
law. If so, I cannot think that your Lordships would do right, if you were now to
reverse, as erroneous, a judgment of the Court of Appeal, proceeding upon a
doctrine which has been accepted as part of the law of England for 280 years.
The doctrine, as stated in 
Pinnel’s Case
, is ‘that payment of a lesser sum on
the day’ (it would of course be the same after the day), ‘in satisfaction of a greater,
cannot be any satisfaction for the whole, because it appears to the Judges, that by
no possibility a lesser sum can be a satisfaction to the plaintiff for a greater sum’.
As stated in Coke Littleton, 212 (b), it is, ‘where the condition is for payment of £20,
the obligor or feoffor cannot at the time appointed pay a lesser sum in satisfaction
of the whole, because it is apparent that a lesser sum of money cannot be a
satisfaction of a greater’; adding (what is beyond controversy), that an acquittance
under seal, in full satisfaction of the whole, would (under like circumstances) be
valid and binding.
The distinction between the effect of a deed under seal, and that of an
agreement by parol, or by writing not under seal, may seem arbitrary, but it is
established in our law; nor is it really unreasonable or practically inconvenient that
the law should require particular solemnities to give to a gratuitous contract the
force of a binding obligation. If the question be (as, in the actual state of the law, I
think it is), whether consideration is, or is not, given in a case of this kind, by the
debtor who pays down part of the debt presently due from him, for a promise by
the creditor to relinquish, after certain further payments on account, the residue of
the debt, I cannot say that I think consideration is given, in the sense in which I
have always understood that word as used in our law. It might be (and indeed I
think it would be) an improvement in our law, if a release or acquittance of the
whole debt, on payment of any sum which the 
creditor might be content to receive
by way of accord and satisfaction (though less than the whole), were held to be,
generally, binding, though not under seal; nor should I be unwilling to see equal
force given to a prospective agreement, like the present, in writing though not
under seal; but I think it impossible, without refinements which practically alter the
sense of the word, to treat such a release or acquittance as supported by any new
consideration proceeding from the debtor. All the authorities … which were relied
upon by the appellant at your Lordships’ Bar … have proceeded upon the
distinction, that, by giving negotiable paper or otherwise, there had been some
new consideration for a new agreement, distinct from mere money payments in or
towards discharge of the original liability. I think it unnecessary to go through those
cases, or to examine the particular grounds on which each of them was decided.
There are no such facts in the case now before your Lordships. What is called ‘any
benefit, or even any legal possibility of benefit’, in Mr Smith’s notes to 
Cumber
 
v.
Wane
 
1 Sm L C 8th ed. 366, is not (as I conceive) that sort of benefit which a
creditor may derive from getting payment of part of the money due to him from a
debtor who might otherwise keep him at arm’s length, or possibly become
insolvent, but is some independent benefit, actual or contingent, of a kind which
might in law be a good and valuable consideration for any other sort of agreement
not under seal.
My conclusion is, that the order appealed from should be affirmed, and the
appeal dismissed, with costs, and I so move your Lordships.
Lord Blackburn
[considered the meaning of the agreement and concluded that Mrs Beer had
relinquished her claim to interest on the judgment debt and continued]
I think, therefore, that it is necessary to consider the ground on which the Court
of Appeal did base their judgment, and to say whether the agreement can be
enforced. I construe it as accepting and taking £500 in satisfaction of the whole
£2090 19s., subject to the condition that unless the balance of the principal debt
was paid by the instalments, the whole might be enforced with interest. If, instead
of £500 in money, it had been a horse valued at £500, or a promissory note for
£500, the authorities are that it would have been a good satisfaction, but it is said
to be otherwise as it was money.
This is a question, I think, of difficulty.
[He considered Coke, Littleton 212 b and 
Pinnel’s Case
, both of which are set
out in the speech of the Earl of Selborne above and continued]
There are two things here resolved. First, that where a matter paid and
accepted in satisfaction of a debt certain might by any possibility be more
beneficial to the creditor than his debt, the Court will not inquire into the adequacy
of the consideration. If the creditor, without any fraud, accepted it in satisfaction
when it was not a sufficient satisfaction it was his own fault. And that payment
before the day might be more beneficial, and consequently that the plea was in
substance good, and this must have been decided in the case.
There is a second point stated to have been resolved, viz.: ‘That payment of a
lesser sum on the day cannot be any satisfaction of the whole, because it appears
to the judges that by no possibility a lesser sum can be a satisfaction to the plaintiff
for a greater sum’. This was certainly not necessary for the decision of the case;
but though the resolution of the Court of Common Pleas was only a dictum, it
seems to me clear that Lord Coke deliberately adopted the dictum, and the great
weight of his authority makes it necessary to be cautious before saying that what
he deliberately adopted as law was a mistake …
[He considered the authorities and continued]
What principally weighs with me in thinking that Lord Coke made a mistake of
fact is my conviction that all men of business, whether merchants or tradesmen, do
every day recognise and act on the ground that prompt payment of a part of their
demand may be more beneficial to them than it would be to insist on their rights
and enforce payment of the whole. Even where the debtor is perfectly solvent, and
sure to pay at last, this often is so. Where the credit of the debtor is doubtful it must
be more so. I had persuaded myself that there was no such long-continued action
on this dictum as to render it improper in this House to reconsider the question. I
had written my reasons for so thinking; but as they were not satisfactory to the
other noble and learned Lords who heard the case, I do not now repeat them nor
persist in them.
I assent to the judgment proposed, though it is not that which I had originally
thought proper.
Lord Watson
 
and 
Lord Fitzgerald
 
delivered concurring judgments in which they
held that, as a matter of construction, Mrs Beer had not promised to forego her
claim to recover interest (although Lord Watson added that he assumed that he
was wrong on this point) but that, in any event, Mrs Beer was entitled to recover
interest because there was no consideration to support any promise to forego
interest.
Commentary
Before dealing with the consideration aspect of 
Foakes
, it is worth exploring the
question of construction because it may shed light on the reasons that led their
Lordships to conclude that Mrs Beer was entitled to interest on the judgment debt on
the particular facts of the case. Professor Treitel (
Some Landmarks of Twentieth
Century Contract Law
 
(Oxford University Press, 2002), pp. 24–26) neatly sets out the
issue as follows:
[T]he question was whether the agreement meant that, if Dr Foakes paid instalments amounting to the
principal sum, then Mrs Beer would not claim interest. There is nothing in the reports to indicate that Dr
Foakes’ liability to pay interest was discussed in the negotiations leading up to the 1876 agreement, and Lord
Selborne doubted whether this issue was ‘really present to the mind of’ Mrs Beer. Nevertheless he held that the
operative part of the agreement was ‘clear’—it said ‘£2090 19s’ and not ‘£2019 19s plus interest’—and, that
being so, the case was governed by the well-established rule that ‘clear’ words in the operative part of an
agreement could not be controlled by recitals—i.e. here by the recital that Dr Foakes was asking for time. On the
issue of construction, Lord Blackburn agreed with Lord Selborne; Lords Fitzgerald and Watson did not agree,
but Lord Watson was prepared to assume that he was wrong on the construction point. There being no record of
any speech from a fifth Law Lord, we have a majority of sorts in favour of Dr Foakes on the construction issue.
But on the issue of legal effect of the agreement the decision went in favour of Mrs Beer. She was not bound by
her promise to forego interest: Dr Foakes had provided no consideration for that promise by paying the
principal sum since he was already bound to make that payment before the promise was made.
The actual decision in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
does not seem to be unjust. What seems to have happened was that Dr
Foakes’ solicitor dug a technical trap for Mrs Beer and the House 
of Lords arranged an equally technical rescue.
The technical trap was the rule that recitals cannot control ‘clear’ words in the operative provisions of a
contract. The technicality invoked to rescue her was the rule in 
Pinnel’s
 
case (as later interpreted) under which
payment by Dr Foakes of part of what was due (the principal) could not constitute consideration for Mrs Beer’s
promise to forego the rest (the interest). I call this a technical rescue because probably she did benefit in fact
from the 1876 agreement. Lord Blackburn stressed this aspect of the case and was critical of the rule in 
Pinnel’s
case. But, being a good judge as well as a great lawyer, he did not dissent: he must have seen that the outcome
proposed by the other members of the House was not unjust. Conversely, the reasoning of those others is, with
respect, less than wholly convincing. They were not prepared to overturn the ‘rule in 
Pinnel’s
 
case’ because it
‘has been accepted as part of the law of England for 280 years’. Sometimes, that would be a strong argument. If
a long-established rule is one on which people rely, there is a case for saying that it should not be overturned by
judicial decision since such a reversal operates retrospectively and so defeats legitimate expectations, at least in
the particular case. But is ‘the rule in 
Pinnel’s
 
case’ really of this kind? Do people rely on this rule, or if they do,
should the law encourage them to do so? I doubt whether the antiquity of the rule was an adequate justification
for continuing to apply it in the circumstances of 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
. If there had been evidence of Mrs Beer’s
intention to exploit the rule as a weapon in the negotiations with Dr Foakes, I should have had little, if any
sympathy with her. The fact that does engage my sympathy on her side is that, although she was probably not
coerced, she does appear to have been tricked into making a promise which, on its true construction, had an
effect not intended by her. The requirement of consideration was a useful tool for protecting her against
trickery.
In this passage Professor Treitel provides a defence of the result on the facts of 
Foakes
but raises a question-mark against the general rule for which the case stands as
authority, namely that payment of part of a debt is not good consideration for a promise
to discharge the entire debt. The general rule has been attacked on a number of different
grounds.
The first is that a payment of part of a debt can be, and generally is, of benefit to the
creditor. This is the point made by Lord Blackburn in the penultimate paragraph
extracted from his judgment (earlier in this section). The second is that the general rule
is easy to evade. The simplest way to do so is for the debtor to provide fresh
consideration for the promise to accept part payment in full settlement of the debt. For
example, the debtor can agree to make payment a day early or make payment at a
different place from that agreed in the contract. Why does the law refuse to give effect to
a promise to treat payment of £95,000 as good consideration for the discharge of a debt
of £100,000 but at the same time give effect to a promise to pay £20,000 in discharge of
a debt of £100,000 where the debtor agrees to make payment at a place other than that
agreed in the contract? The law should not encourage such artificial behaviour: it should
look to the substance of the transaction and not its form. Provided that the creditor
intends to be bound by his promise to accept part payment as full satisfaction of the
debt, should the law not give effect to the new agreement? Thirdly, it can be argued that
the rule in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
is out of step with modern developments in the doctrine of
consideration, particularly the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey
Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 1 (
5.2.2.3.2
).
Given these criticisms, why has the general rule survived for as long as it has? There
appear to be two answers to this question. The first is that the rule has played a useful
role in protecting creditors from unscrupulous debtors and the second is the operation
of the doctrine of precedent. We shall consider these alternatives in turn.
5.2.2.4.1
 
Protection of the creditor
The protective function of the rule established in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
can be seen on the facts
of the case itself. But a clearer illustration of the need to protect creditors from
unscrupulous debtors is provided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
D & C
Builders
 
v. 
Rees
 
[1966] 2 QB 617. The plaintiffs, a small building company, carried out
building work for the defendant. The defendant paid £250 on account and a balance of
£482 13s. 1d. remained outstanding. The plaintiffs made several requests for payment
but received no reply. By this time the plaintiff company was in ‘desperate financial
straits’. The defendant’s wife offered to pay them £300 in settlement of the whole claim.
The plaintiffs stated that they would accept £300 straight away and give the defendant a
year to find the balance. The defendant’s wife refused to agree to this, stating, ‘we will
never have enough money to pay the balance. £300 is better than nothing.’ The
plaintiffs stated that they had no choice but to accept. The defendant’s wife gave the
plaintiffs a cheque for £300 and insisted that they give her a receipt which included the
words ‘in completion of the account’. The plaintiffs then brought an action for the
balance. The Court of Appeal held that the purported settlement did not bar the
plaintiffs from recovering the balance of the debt.
In reaching the conclusion that the settlement was not binding on the plaintiffs
Danckwerts and Winn LJJ simply applied 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
. Lord Denning, however, took
a different approach. While he did not seek to challenge the authority of 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
at common law (he could not do so as a matter of authority), he resorted to equity in an
attempt to confine, if not undermine, 
Foakes
. Thus he was careful to say that the reason
why the plaintiffs were entitled to sue for the balance of the price was that the defendant
had behaved inequitably. In his words:
The creditor is only barred from his legal rights when it would be 
inequitable
 
for him to insist upon them.
Where there has been a true 
accord
, under which the creditor voluntarily agrees to accept a lesser sum in
satisfaction, and the debtor acts upon that accord by paying the lesser sum and the creditor accepts it, then it is
inequitable for the creditor afterwards to insist on the balance. But he is not bound unless there has been truly
an accord between them.
This division of opinion in many ways reflects the debate that has taken place over the
true analysis of 
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
(on which see 
5.2.2.3.1
). The majority judgments adopt
traditional reasoning, based on the absence of consideration for the promise to
discharge the entire debt, while the minority opinion of Lord Denning attempts to
distinguish an agreement that has been freely concluded from one that has been
extracted as a result of the application of illegitimate pressure.
This protective role of 
Foakes
 
may suggest a limit to the rule, namely that it should only
apply where its effect is to protect the creditor against an unscrupulous debtor. On this
basis, a creditor who voluntarily enters into an agreement under which he agrees to
accept part payment of a debt in discharge of the entire debt should be bound by that
agreement. The House of Lords in 
Foakes
 
did not, however, adopt this position. On the
contrary, it held that there is no consideration to support such an agreement, whether
the creditor enters into it freely or under pressure from the debtor. But the willingness
of a creditor to enter into the agreement may be of considerable importance in relation
to the possible application of the doctrine of estoppel. In other words, a creditor who
voluntarily agrees to accept part payment in discharge of the entire debt may be
estopped from going back upon his promise if 
the debtor makes that part payment.
Support for this proposition can be derived from the decision of the Court of Appeal in
Collier
 
v. 
P & M J Wright (Holdings) Ltd
 
[2007] EWCA Civ 1329, [2008] 1 WLR 643.
The applicant was one of three partners who, between them, owed £46,000 to the
defendant. The liability of the partners was joint (that is to say there was one liability for
£46,000, so that one partner could be called upon to pay the entire debt and he would
then have a claim to recover a share of that debt from his fellow partners by way of a
claim for contribution). The applicant alleged that he had made an oral agreement with
the defendant under which it was agreed that his liability should be limited to one third
of the judgment debt and that the defendant would recover the rest of the debt from the
other two partners. The applicant, over a period of five years, paid £15,600 to the
defendant. The defendant then claimed that he was entitled to recover the balance of the
judgment debt from the applicant, who relied on the oral agreement he had reached
with the defendant. The defendant submitted that he was not bound by the alleged
agreement, relying upon 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
. The Court of Appeal held that the applicant had
established an arguable case that promissory estoppel might afford him a defence to the
claim of the defendant.
Two reasoned judgments were given. The first, given by Arden LJ, drew heavily upon
the judgment of Lord Denning in 
D & C Builders.
 
She deduced from the authorities the
following proposition (at [42]):
[I]f (1) a debtor offers to pay part only of the amount he owes; (2) the creditor voluntarily accepts that offer, and
(3) in reliance on the creditor’s acceptance the debtor pays that part of the amount he owes in full, the creditor
will, by virtue of the doctrine of promissory estoppel, be bound to accept that sum in full and final satisfaction of
the whole debt. For him to resile will of itself be inequitable. In addition, in these circumstances, the promissory
estoppel has the effect of extinguishing the creditor’s right to the balance of the debt.
On this basis a debtor who pays (as distinct from one who merely promises to pay) the
promised part of the debt may now be able to rely upon promissory estoppel in order to
defeat a claim brought by the creditor to recover the balance of the debt. This is an
important conclusion in relation to the sphere of application of 
Foakes
. On the facts of
Foakes
 
the debtor had paid the promised part of the debt and so, on the reasoning of
Arden LJ, ought to have been able to rely on promissory estoppel as a defence to the
creditor’s claim.
The second judgment, given by Longmore LJ, was more circumspect. While he accepted
that the applicant had established an arguable case of estoppel, he registered three
concerns (at [45]–[48]) about the scope of the principle set out by Arden LJ. First, he
stated that the agreement to give up the claim for the balance of the debt must be clearly
established on the evidence. The courts will not lightly infer that a creditor has promised
to give up his right to recover the balance of the debt. Secondly, the debtor must
establish that the creditor has agreed to give up his right on a permanent basis and that
he has not simply agreed to suspend his right to payment for a period of time. Thirdly, it
must be inequitable for the creditor to go back on his promise to accept part payment in
discharge of the entire debt. On this basis he concluded that, if the approach advocated
by Arden LJ is to be adopted, ‘it is perhaps all the more important that agreements
which are said to forgo a creditor’s rights on a permanent basis should not be too
benevolently construed’.
It remains to be seen what impact 
Collier
 
will have on 
Foakes.
 
But it has the potential
significantly to limit the rule in 
Foakes
. On the basis of 
Collier
, a creditor who
voluntarily 
agrees to accept payment of part of a debt in discharge of the entire debt and
who receives that part payment from the debtor, may find that his right to claim the
balance of the debt has been extinguished by operation of the doctrine of estoppel.
5.2.2.4.2
 
The role of precedent
The second reason for the survival of 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
is that it is a decision of the House
of Lords and so can now only be overruled by the Supreme Court. But the doctrine of
precedent does not prevent a court from distinguishing 
Foakes,
 
and here the vital issue
is the extent to which it is possible to distinguish 
Foakes
 
by invoking the principle laid
down by the Court of Appeal in 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
. There are two cases of
significance here. The first is the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
In re Selectmove
[1995] 1 WLR 474, where an orthodox approach was taken and 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
was
applied. The second case is the more recent decision of the Court of Appeal in 
MWB
Business Exchange Centres Ltd
 
v. 
Rock Advertising Ltd
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 553, [2017]
QB 604, where the Court of Appeal distinguished 
Foakes
 
and applied 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey
Bros
 
in order to find the existence of consideration to support an agreement to vary the
payment obligation under a licence to occupy property. We shall consider each case in
turn.
IN RE SELECTMOVE
[1995] 1 WLR 474, Court of Appeal
In July 1991 Selectmove Ltd owed substantial amounts of income tax (PAYE) and
national insurance contributions (NIC) to the Inland Revenue. Mr Ffookes, the
managing director of the company, met with Mr Polland, a collector of taxes. At that
meeting Mr Ffookes claimed that he put a proposal to Mr Polland to the effect that
Selectmove Ltd would pay future tax and national insurance liabilities as they fell
due and would pay off the arrears at a rate of £1,000 per month. Mr Ffookes
further claimed that Mr Polland stated that he would have to seek approval from
his superiors to such a proposal and that he would revert to Mr Ffookes if the
proposal was unacceptable. Mr Polland did not get back in touch with Mr Ffookes.
In October 1991 the Revenue wrote to the company demanding payment of
arrears of £24,650 and threatened a winding-up petition if payment was not made.
The Revenue served a statutory demand for payment and presented a winding-up
petition in September 1992. On behalf of the company it was submitted that the
petition should be dismissed. The judge rejected the submission and compulsorily
wound up the company. The company appealed to the Court of Appeal. One of the
grounds on which they appealed was that an agreement had been reached with
the Revenue in July 1991 and that agreement was supported by consideration.
The Court of Appeal held that no such agreement had been reached but that, in
any event, there was no consideration to support the alleged agreement.
Peter Gibson LJ
There are two elements to the consideration which the company claims was
provided by it to the revenue. One is the promise to pay off its existing liability by
instalments from 1 February 1992. The other is the promise to pay future PAYE
and NIC as they fell due. Mr Nugee [counsel for Selectmove] suggested that
implicit in the latter was the promise to continue trading. But that cannot be spelt
out of Mr Ffookes’ evidence as to what he agreed with Mr Polland. Accordingly, the
second element is no more than a promise to pay that 
which it was bound to pay
under the fiscal legislation at the date at which it was bound to make such
payment. If the first element is not good consideration, I do not see why the
second element should be either.
The judge held that the case fell within the principle of 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
(1884) 9
App Cas 605. … Although their Lordships were unanimous in the result, that case
is notable for the powerful speech of Lord Blackburn, who made plain his
disagreement with the course the law had taken in and since 
Pinnel’s Case
 
(1602)
5 Co Rep 117a and which the House of Lords in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
9 App. Cas. 605,
decided should not be reversed. Lord Blackburn expressed his conviction, at p.
622, that
‘all men of business, whether merchants or tradesmen, do every day recognise and act on the ground
that prompt payment of a part of their demand may be more beneficial to them than it would be to insist
on their rights and enforce payment of the whole.’
Yet it is clear that the House of Lords decided that a practical benefit of that nature
is not good consideration in law.
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
has been followed and applied in numerous cases
subsequently, of which I shall mention two. In 
Vanbergen
 
v. 
St Edmunds Properties
Ltd
 
[1933] 2 KB 223, 231 Lord Hanworth MR said
‘It is a well established principle that a promise to pay a sum which the debtor is already bound by law to
pay to the promisee does not afford any consideration to support the contract.’
More recently in 
D & C Builders Ltd
 
v. 
Rees
 
[1966] 2 QB 617 this court also applied
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
, Danckwerts LJ saying, at p. 626, that the case
‘settled definitely the rule of law that payment of a lesser sum than the amount of a debt due cannot be a
satisfaction of the debt, unless there is some benefit to the creditor added so that there is an accord and
satisfaction.’
Mr Nugee, however, submitted that an additional benefit to the Crown was
conferred by the agreement in that the Crown stood to derive practical benefits
therefrom: it was likely to recover more from not enforcing its debt against the
company, which was known to be in financial difficulties, than from putting the
company into liquidation. He pointed to the fact that the company did in fact pay its
further PAYE and NIC liabilities and £7,000 of its arrears. He relied on the decision
of this court in 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 1
for the proposition that a promise to perform an existing obligation can amount to
good consideration provided that there are practical benefits to the promisee.
[He considered the case, noting in particular the six-point summary to be found
in the judgment of Glidewell LJ and continued]
Mr Nugee submitted that, although Glidewell LJ in terms confined his remarks
to a case where B is to do the work for or supply goods or services to A, the same
principle must apply where B’s obligation is to pay A, and he referred to an article
by Adams and Brownsword, ‘Contract, Consideration and the Critical Path’ (1990)
53 
MLR
 
536, 539–540 which suggests that 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
might need
reconsideration. I see the force of the argument, but the difficulty that I feel with it is
that, if the principle of 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1
QB 1 is to be extended to an obligation to make payment, it would in effect leave
the principle in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
without any application. When a creditor and a
debtor who are at arm’s length reach agreement on the payment of the debt by
instalments to accommodate the debtor, the creditor will no doubt always see a
practical benefit to himself in so doing. In 
the absence of authority there would be
much to be said for the enforceability of such a contract. But that was a matter
expressly considered in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
yet held not to constitute good
consideration in law. 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
was not even referred to in 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey
Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 1, and it is in my judgment
impossible, consistently with the doctrine of precedent, for this court to extend the
principle of the 
Williams
 
case to any circumstances governed by the principle of
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
9 App Cas 605. If that extension is to be made, it must be by the
House of Lords or, perhaps even more appropriately, by Parliament after
consideration by the Law Commission.
In my judgment, the judge was right to hold that if there was an agreement
between the company and the revenue it was unenforceable for want of
consideration.
Stuart-Smith
 
and 
Balcombe LJJ
 
agreed with the judgment of Peter Gibson LJ.
Commentary
The Court of Appeal here concluded that 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
remains good law and that it
has not been undermined by 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
. That said, 
Foakes
 
received a
distinctly lukewarm reception. Had the matter not been governed by authority it seems
clear that Peter Gibson LJ would have reached a contrary conclusion to that reached by
the House of Lords in 
Foakes
. But he does make one very significant point in relation to
the extension of the ‘practical benefit’ test to a promise to pay part of a debt, and that is
that its effect will be to leave the principle in 
Foakes
 
‘without any application’. The
reason for this is that payment of money will always constitute a ‘practical benefit’ to the
creditor. Thus, in his view, the consequence of extending 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
 
to the
case of part payment of a debt would not be to limit or confine 
Foakes
 
but to undermine
it.
What is the view of the relationship between 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
 
and 
Foakes
 
that
emerges from 
Williams
 
and 
Selectmove
? Here we encounter the problem that the Court
of Appeal in 
Williams
 
did not consider 
Foakes
 
and so did not attempt to explain the
relationship between the two cases. Peter Gibson LJ in 
Selectmove
 
did not doubt the
correctness of 
Williams
 
(see 
Forde
 
v. 
Birmingham City Council
 
[2009] EWHC 12 (QB),
[2009] 1 WLR 2732, [89]), and so it remains binding up to and including the level of the
Court of Appeal. Is there a relevant difference between 
Williams
 
and 
Foakes
? The short
answer is that 
Williams
 
is about a promise to pay more, whereas 
Foakes
 
is about a
promise to accept less (or, to use the language of Professor Treitel (
Some Landmarks of
Twentieth Century Contract Law
 
(Oxford University Press, 2002)), 
Williams
 
is a case
of an ‘increasing pact’ while 
Foakes
 
is a ‘decreasing pact’). Thus there is a clear
distinction on the facts between the two cases, but is there a distinction in principle?
Peter Gibson LJ does not answer this particular question. His analysis of the
relationship between the two cases is conducted in terms of authority rather than
principle. This is understandable given that he was bound by the two decisions, but it
leaves the question of principle unanswered. His suggestion that the relationship
between the two cases should be considered by the Law Commission and then by
Parliament is unlikely to bear fruit. The issue is not of sufficient practical significance to
attract the time and the resources of the Law Commission. It is therefore likely that it
will be left to the courts themselves to work out the relationship between the two cases.
The most authoritative modern consideration of the relationship between the two lines
of authority is to be found in the following case:
MWB BUSINESS EXCHANGE CENTRES LTD V. ROCK
ADVERTISING LTD
[2016] EWCA Civ 553, [2017] QB 604, Court of Appeal
The defendant, Rock Advertising Ltd, occupied premises in central London which
were managed by the claimant, MWB Business Exchange Centres Ltd. In
November 2011 the defendant agreed to take additional space and to pay to the
claimant a licence fee of £3,500 per month for the first three months, and that
thereafter the monthly sum would increase to £4,433.34 (both sums exclusive of
VAT). The business did not develop as the defendant had anticipated and it found
itself unable to pay the new licence fee. By late February 2012 it had accumulated
arrears of some £12,000. On 30 March 2012 the claimant exercised its right under
the licence agreement to lock the defendant out of the premises and subsequently
it purported to terminate the licence agreement between the parties.
The defendant challenged the entitlement of the claimant to act in this manner.
For this purpose it relied upon an oral agreement alleged to have been made
between the claimant’s credit-controller and the defendant’s managing director on
27 February 2012, under which it was agreed to ‘re-schedule the licence fee
payments due under the agreement over the period from February to October
2012’ on the basis that the defendant would pay less in the early months but more
towards the end of the year so that the arrears would be paid off by the end of the
calendar year. The claimant denied that such an oral agreement had been entered
into between the parties but, in any event, it submitted that any such agreement
was not legally enforceable because it lacked consideration to support it. At first
instance Judge Moloney held that the agreement to pay in accordance with the
revised schedule was supported by consideration because there was a ‘possible
commercial benefit’ to the claimant in retaining an existing tenant, even if it was a
questionable payer, in the hope of perhaps recovering some of the arrears. The
Court of Appeal also held that the agreement was supported by consideration.
Kitchin LJ
Consideration
37. Mr Darton [counsel for the claimant, MWB] contended that the judge fell into
error in his approach to consideration and in support of that submission relied
primarily upon the decision of the House of Lords in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
(1884) 9 App
Cas 605 and the decision of this court in 
In re Selectmove Ltd
 
[1995] 1 WLR 474.
[He considered the two cases and continued]
46.
 
Founding himself on these authorities, Mr Darton submitted that it is clear
that the judge was wrong to find that Rock’s payment of the £3,500 and its
agreement to comply with the other terms of the revised payment schedule
amounted to good consideration. The benefits conferred on MWB were, said Mr
Darton, just the kind of practical benefits which Lord Blackburn in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
and this court in 
In re Selectmove
 
recognised might flow from an agreement for the
payment of a debt by instalments to accommodate the debtor, yet in both cases
they were held not to amount to good consideration. Further, he continued, if the
rule in 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey
 
is to be extended to the circumstances governed by
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
, it must be by (what is now) the Supreme Court or by Parliament.
47.
 
I have to say that I was initially much attracted by these submissions.
However, upon reflection, I have come to the conclusion that they fail to take
proper account of the full extent of the factual findings of the judge. He was clearly
of the view that the oral variation 
agreement would have a number of beneficial
consequences for MWB. First, MWB would recover some of the arrears
immediately and would have some hope of recovering them all in due course. But
secondly and importantly, Rock would remain a licensee and continue to occupy
the property with the result that it would not be left standing empty for some time at
further loss to MWB.
48.
 
There has been no suggestion that MWB was at any material time
operating under any kind of duress. Rather, acting by Miss Evans [a credit
controller employed by MWB], it had for some time been trying to find a way to
accommodate Rock’s financial difficulties. There was, so it seems to me, a
commercial advantage to both MWB and Rock in reaching an agreement if that
could be achieved. MWB would receive an immediate payment of £3,500, it would
be likely to recover more from Rock than it would by enforcing the terms of the
original agreement and it would also retain Rock as a licensee. Rock would remain
in occupation of the property, continue its business without interruption and have
an opportunity to overcome its cash flow difficulties. Accordingly this is not a case
in which the only benefits conferred on MWB by the oral variation agreement were
benefits of a kind contemplated by Lord Blackburn in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
and by this
court in 
In re Selectmove
. MWB derived a practical benefit which went beyond the
advantage of receiving a prompt payment of a part of the arrears and a promise
that it would be paid the balance of the arrears and any deferred licence fees over
the course of the forthcoming months. This is therefore a case where, as in
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey
, Rock’s immediate payment of £3,500 and its agreement to
perform its obligations under the revised payment schedule conferred a practical
benefit on MWB which amounted to good consideration, so rendering the oral
variation agreement enforceable.
49.
 
I conclude that the judge was right to find that the payment by Rock of the
£3,500 and its promise to make further payments in accordance with the revised
payment schedule conferred upon MWB a benefit which constituted sufficient
consideration to support the oral variation agreement. In my judgment the oral
variation agreement thereupon became binding upon MWB and it would remain
binding for so long as Rock continued to make payments in accordance with the
i)
ii)
iii)
revised payment schedule. I would add that I agree with the judgment of Lady
Justice Arden on this issue at [69] to [87] below. I prefer to express no view as to
whether the oral variation agreement can properly be characterised as a collateral
unilateral contract, however, for this is a point upon which we heard no
submissions.
McCombe LJ
67. I am most grateful to Kitchin and Arden LJJ for their judgments both of which I
have read in draft. I agree that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given
by Kitchin LJ and those given by Arden LJ in paragraphs 69 to 87 of her judgment.
I would prefer not to base my own decision upon the issue of ‘collateral unilateral
contract’ with which Arden LJ deals in paragraphs 88 to 90 of her judgment.
Arden LJ
Consideration: practical benefit to MWB of variation agreement
was good consideration in law
Summary of my conclusion
69. MWB contends that the judge was wrong in law to hold that the variation
agreement was supported by consideration and that for this reason it was not
bound by its promise to accept deferred payments in that agreement.
70.
 
In agreement with Lord Justice Kitchin, I consider that this contention is
unsound. In summary, the practical benefit which the judge found that MWB
derived from the variation agreement constituted good consideration: see 
Williams
v. 
Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
. Neither the Rule in 
Pinnel’s
 
case nor
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
nor 
Re Selectmove
 
prevents that conclusion. Furthermore, the
variation agreement may be a contract between the parties which is properly
analysed as a collateral unilateral contract.
71.
 
On consideration, there are three steps in my reasoning:
the judge’s findings,
practical benefit as good consideration in law and
Pinnel’s
 
case, which does not apply as there is good consideration.
Judge’s findings
72. The material findings are in paragraphs 14 and 20 of the concise judgment of
the judge.
[She considered the findings of the judge and continued]
75.
 
In the space of his short judgment, the judge gave significant emphasis to
consideration, and it seems therefore unlikely that he did not have in mind that
MWB obtained some benefit over and above that simply derived from
accommodating the debtor. The benefit to the licensor was thus that it would not be
at risk that the unit previously occupied by Rock would stand empty for some time
at loss to itself, and that it (the licensor) would have an improved prospect of
obtaining payment of the licence fee arrears. There was therefore an identifiable,
practical benefit to the creditor over and above the mere acceptance of the reality
that the defaulting debtor was not in a position to pay more than the variation
agreement stipulated. The judge clearly considered that the parties had reached
an accord on this.
Practical benefit can be good consideration in law
77. The law requires that the promisee (here Rock) must provide consideration to
make a promise by the promisor enforceable in law. So Rock had to show that it
gave consideration for MWB’s agreement to accept the terms of the variation
agreement.
78.
 
In my judgment, this requirement is satisfied where the promisee shows
that his renewed promise to perform an existing obligation results in the promisor
receiving a benefit which he requested or at least indicated he wanted from the
renegotiation. That is what happened in 
Roffey
 
…
79.
 
There are other illustrations of this form of consideration in the case law,
including 
Ward
 
v. 
Byham
 
[1956] 1 WLR 496. Reference may also be made to the
observations of the Privy Council in 
Pao On
 
v. 
Lau Yiu Long
 
[1980] AC 614 at 631
to 632. Glidewell LJ discussed both these cases in 
Roffey
. The development of this
form of consideration is comparatively modern, but it is confirmed in 
Roffey.
 
The
principle that a benefit can in law be consideration for a promise must logically
apply whatever the nature of the contract. It must also apply whether the promisee
has at the same time agreed to render the same performance as he originally
promised or to render a lesser performance, and whether the promisor has
renewed his original promise or, as in 
Roffey
, agreed to pay more.
80.
 
Professor G.H. Treitel at paragraph 4–070 of 
Chitty on Contracts
, vol 1,
32nd edition sums up the modern state of the law in relation to consideration for
agreements to perform obligations already due under the original contract in the
following words, with which I respectfully agree:
‘Where [the debtor’s conduct did not constitute economic duress], and the promisee has in fact conferred
a benefit on the promisor by performing the original contract, then the requirement of consideration is
satisfied and there seems to be no good reason for refusing to enforce the new promise.’
81. On different facts, reliance on consideration in the form of securing a benefit to
the promisor which the promisor wants, rather than the more conventional form of
consideration consisting of a detriment to the promisee, might result in the
enforcement of a contract that had been made ill-advisedly or under improper
pressure. However this concern should not be overstated since in the latter
situation at least a remedy now exists for economic duress which may protect the
disadvantaged creditor. I am also not concerned that in this case the judge
describes the practical benefit as ‘just enough’ to constitute adequate
consideration since on general principle the court is not required to ask whether
MWB made a good bargain in this situation: the important point is that the practical
benefit was an additional item.
Pinnel’s 
case does not have to be considered where there is good consideration
82. The argument for MWB amounts to this: the variation agreement was a
promise to pay a smaller amount than originally agreed in that the time value of
money has the effect that an agreement to defer payment of a due debt is in effect
an agreement to pay a smaller sum. MWB invokes the well-known rule in 
Pinnel’s
case for the proposition that in those circumstances there is no good consideration
in law: see 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
…
83.
 
Furthermore in 
re Selectmove
, this Court drew a distinction between
obligations to perform work and obligations to pay money and it held that the
practical benefit to the creditor of (my words) ‘a bird in the hand rather than two in
the bush’ did not mean that a contract to pay a lesser sum than originally agreed
was enforceable …
84.
 
In my judgment, 
Selectmove
 
is distinguishable from the present case and
decides only that the benefit which a creditor obtains from a promise to pay an
existing debt by instalments is not good consideration in law. In that case, there
was no finding by the trial judge that there was any extra benefit to the Inland
Revenue in having an instalment agreement with the taxpayer. The question of
practical benefit only arose in this Court in 
Selectmove
 
because counsel for the
taxpayer argued that there was consideration because the instalment agreement
was beneficial to the Inland Revenue in the sense that it had a promise to make
payments in discharge of the existing debt in accordance with an agreed schedule,
which would obviate the need for it to take steps to enforce payment of the amount
owed to it. It was that argument that Peter Gibson LJ rejected. Peter Gibson LJ
could not reject the general principle that, where there was other consideration,
which the law recognised was sufficient to support a contract, that was good
consideration for a promise. There can be no coherent distinction between
agreements to pay debts and agreements to do work in this context. The strength
of that general principle may well explain why in 
Roffey
 
this Court did not refer to
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
.
85.
 
My conclusion that 
Selectmove
 
can be distinguished in this case is not
inconsistent with 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
, where the only suggested consideration was the
debtor’s promise to pay part of his existing debt. Nor is it inconsistent with the
dictum of Lord Coke LC in 
Pinnel’s
 
case itself. After stating that ‘payment of a
lesser sum … in satisfaction of a greater, cannot be any satisfaction for the whole,’
Lord Coke had added a rider that ‘the gift of a horse, hawk or robe, etc in
satisfaction is good for it shall be intended that a horse, hawk, or robe, etc might
be more beneficial to the plaintiff than the money.’ The House of Lords in 
Foakes
 
v.
Beer
 
approved both the statement of general rule and the rider. As the law of
consideration now stands, the gift of the horse, hawk or robe is no different in
principle from the conferral of 
a benefit or advantage. … In accepting that a
practical benefit can be good consideration for part payment of a debt, all I am
doing is replacing the words ‘the gift of a horse, hawk or robe’ with a more modern
equivalent in line with the responsibility which Glidewell LJ in 
Roffey
 
(at 16)
described as refining and limiting the common law but leaving the principle (the
actual Rule in 
Pinnel’s
 
case) unscathed.
86.
 
The judge held that MWB did not enter into the variation agreement simply
to accommodate Rock. I accept that in the light of 
Selectmove
 
it may be difficult for
any benefit solely of that kind to constitute a practical benefit for the purposes of
the law of consideration. On the judge’s findings it did so in its own interests in
order to, as I put it above, avoid a void and that this was a practical benefit to
MWB. In those circumstances there was in my judgment on the judge’s findings a
binding contract in law.
87.
 
As I explained in 
Collier
 
v. 
Wright
, the Rule in 
Pinnel’s
 
case is controversial
and the Sixth Interim Report of the Law Revision Committee in 1937 under the
chairmanship of Lord Wright MR made recommendations for its reform, which
Parliament has not accepted or implemented. If my Lords agree that I have
correctly stated the law, the necessary result of this is that there will be cases in
the future, of which this is one, where agreements to pay a lesser sum than was
due under a previous contract will be held to be enforceable because there has
been shown to have been consideration in the form of a practical benefit to the
creditor which he sought and which is an identifiable benefit over and above the
mere fact of accommodating the debtor and not having to enforce payment of the
debt. This may well strike a satisfactory balance between on the one hand
enforcing promises and enabling debtors to rely on their creditors’ promises and on
the other hand of protecting creditors from debtors who seek unfairly to gain an
advantage from their creditors.
88.
 
That leads to the question whether MWB was bound to accept the deferred
payments provided for in the variation agreement as soon as Rock paid the sum of
£3,500 and even if it made no further payment. That would not have been a
sensible commercial agreement. Accordingly it is unlikely that the parties made an
agreement in those terms. (The case was argued on the basis that the payment of
£3,500 had to be made before the agreement became binding: it was not argued
that the variation agreement became binding merely on the exchange of promises
and so I do not need to deal with that still less sensible result). Lord Justice Kitchin
has addressed this problem by holding that the variation agreement contained a
term that the rescheduling arrangement would be binding on MWB only so long as
Rock performed its side of the bargain (paragraph 49 above). I agree that that is
one interpretation and analysis which addresses the problem. But there is another
possible interpretation and analysis which would lead to the same result that Rock
would have to perform the whole of its side of the bargain. That would be the case
if the variation agreement took effect as a collateral unilateral contract (binding on
MWB once the sum of £3,500 was paid), and accordingly that is the question
which I next consider.
Was the variation agreement a collateral unilateral contract?
89. Rock was not bound to continue as licensee of its unit for more than the
contractual term, which was shorter than the period over which its arrears were
rescheduled. The variation agreement, conferring as it did on MWB the advantage
of ‘avoiding a void’ meant that Rock had to be the occupier. Rock did continue to
occupy its unit until the licence was terminated. To reconcile the parties’ legal
positions, my provisional view (in the absence of argument) is that Rock’s
acceptance of MWB’s promise gave rise to a ‘collateral unilateral contract,’
meaning that, collaterally to the licence, for so long as Rock was entitled to and did
occupy the unit and paid the licence fee as renegotiated, MWB would be bound on
payment 
of the initial £3,500 to accept the deferral of the arrears in accordance
with the variation agreement. This seems to me to be the legal effect of what the
parties agreed, which was confirmed by Rock’s immediate payment of £3,500 to
MWB. Although the effect of the variation agreement if it was supported by
consideration was not the subject of submissions, it was not suggested by either
party that Rock could take the benefit of the variation agreement without
performing its side of the bargain, or that MWB could withdraw from the variation
agreement so long as Rock was complying with it.
90.
 
I gratefully adopt the concept of ‘collateral unilateral contract’ in this context
from a helpful article: M Chen-Wishart, 
Reforming Consideration – No Greener
Pastures
 
in S Degeling, J Edelman and J Goudkamp (eds), 
Contract in
Commercial Law
 
(Sydney, Thomson, 2016) (Publication pending). Since writing
this judgment I have also seen 
A Bird in the Hand: Consideration and Contract
Modifications
 
(Andrew S Burrows and Edwin Peel (eds) 
Contract Formation and
Parties
 
(OUP, 2010) pages 89–113) by the same author, which also discusses this
point.
Commentary
The Court of Appeal held that Judge Moloney had been entitled to conclude that the
revised agreement was supported by consideration and that it would remain binding so
long as Rock continued to make payments in accordance with the revised payment
schedule. A number of points can be made about this conclusion.
The first is that a narrow reading of the case might lead to the conclusion that the Court
of Appeal did no more than decline to interfere with the finding of Judge Moloney that
the practical benefits obtained by MWB from the revised agreement were sufficient to
amount in law to the provision of consideration (see [47] and [75]). But this is to adopt
an unduly narrow reading of the judgments. This is the first ground given by Arden LJ
in support of her conclusion, but it is not the only one. The other grounds are of much
wider potential significance.
The second point is that 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
, while still formally good law, would appear now
to be confined to the case where the creditor obtains no benefit other than the promise
to pay part of the debt (see [85]) or obtains no more than prompt payment of a part of
the debt and a promise that the balance of the arrears will be paid ([48]). The important
‘practical’ benefit obtained by MWB on the facts of the present case was that Rock would
remain a licensee and continue to occupy the property so that the property would not be
left standing empty for some time at further loss to MWB. On this basis it would appear
that the practical benefit obtained as a result of the preservation of the underlying
relationship out of which the obligation to pay the debt has arisen can constitute
sufficient consideration to support a promise to pay a part of the debt. But in the case
where there is no relationship other than a strict debtor/creditor relationship it would
appear that the creditor might still be able to argue, as was the case in 
Foakes
, that the
mere promise to pay, or even the payment of, part of the debt will not constitute
consideration for the discharge of the entire debt.
Thirdly, it should be noted that Arden LJ (at [79]) drew on cases concerned with a duty
imposed by law (
Ward
 
v. 
Byham
, see 
5.2.2.2
) and a duty imposed by contract with a
third party (
Pao On
 
v. 
Lau Yiu Long
, see 
5.2.2.1
) in support of her analysis. More
questionable perhaps is her citation from 
Chitty on Contracts
 
because that passage is
directed only to duties imposed by a contract with a promisor and it does not expressly
extend to the 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
fact pattern (although the point is made later in that edition
of 
Chitty
 
at para 4–119, when discussing 
Foakes
, that ‘the law would be more consistent
as well as more satisfactory in its practical operation’ if it adopted the factual or practical
benefit analysis in cases of part payment of a debt: for the equivalent passage see para
6–129 of the current, 34th edition of 
Chitty
).
Fourthly, it would appear that the consideration provided by Rock did not take the form
of a simple promise to pay the rent in accordance with the revised payment schedule but
that it was necessary for Rock actually to make the payments it had promised to make.
This emerges clearly from the adoption by Arden LJ of the ‘collateral unilateral contract’
analysis ([89]–[90]) developed by Professor Chen-Wishart (on which see 
5.2.2.3.2.7
).
According to this analysis MWB was bound to accept the revised payment schedule only
for so long as Rock adhered to it. While Kitchen and McCombe LJJ declined to adopt the
‘collateral unilateral contract’ analysis (see [49] and [67]), given that it had not been the
subject of submissions by counsel, the analysis of Kitchin LJ would appear to reach a
similar conclusion to that of Arden LJ, in that he stated (at [49]) that the agreement
‘would remain binding for so long as Rock continued to make payments in accordance
with the revised payment schedule’. On this basis it is not the promise to pay part of the
debt that amounts to the provision of consideration by the debtor, but the performance
of that promise by making payment provided that, in doing so, a sufficient practical
benefit is conferred upon the creditor.
Fifthly, the statement by Arden LJ (at [84]) that there ‘can be no coherent distinction
between agreements to pay debts and agreements to do work in this context’ clearly
suggests that it may no longer be possible to regard 
Foakes
 
and 
Williams
 
as inhabiting
different worlds, with the former dealing with a promise to accept less and the latter a
promise to pay more. The irrelevance of the distinction is also evident from Arden LJ’s
statement (at [79]) that the ‘principle that a benefit can in law be consideration for a
promise must logically apply whatever the nature of the contract’. The point is an
important one because, once it is accepted that the practical benefit analysis can apply to
the 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
fact pattern, there is, as Peter Gibson LJ accepted in 
Selectmove
, very
little left of the rule that a promise to pay, or payment of, part of a debt is not good
consideration for discharge of the entire debt.
Sixthly, it is worth noting that Rock submitted that MWB was estopped from resiling
from the agreement to accept payment in accordance with the revised schedule. Given
its conclusion that the revised agreement was contractually binding, it was not
technically necessary for the Court of Appeal to consider whether Rock was entitled to
invoke the assistance of estoppel but the court nevertheless proceeded to consider the
issue. On the facts it would have held that MWB was not estopped from seeking to
reimpose its legal rights under the original agreement. It had notified Rock of its change
of mind two days after the oral variation had been agreed, and in these circumstances
the Court of Appeal would have held that MWB had given Rock reasonable notice that it
must in future pay the licence fee in accordance with the original agreement and Rock
would not have been able to maintain that it had suffered prejudice by relying on the
original agreement. On this basis Rock would not have been able to invoke the
assistance of estoppel, but the point did not in the end matter because the variation was
held to be binding as it was supported by consideration.
The Supreme Court was given the opportunity to review these issues when it heard
MWB’s appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal ([2018] UKSC 24, [2019] AC
119) but it declined to do so, largely because it allowed the appeal on another ground
which rendered it unnecessary to decide whether or not consideration had been
supplied on the facts of the case. This refusal to take on the issue has been the cause of
considerable disappointment to 
many academic commentators. Lord Sumption dealt
with the submissions on the existence or otherwise of consideration in a single
paragraph in the following terms:
[18]
 
That [ie, the conclusion that the appeal was to be decided on another ground] makes it unnecessary to deal
with consideration. It is also, I think, undesirable to do so. The issue is a difficult one. The only consideration
which MWB can be said to have been given for accepting a less advantageous schedule of payments was (i) the
prospect that the payments were more likely to be made if they were loaded onto the back end of the contract
term, and (ii) the fact that MWB would be less likely to have the premises left vacant on its hands while it
sought a new licensee. These were both expectations of practical value, but neither was a contractual
entitlement. In 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 1, the Court of Appeal held
that an expectation of commercial advantage was good consideration. The problem about this was that practical
expectation of benefit was the very thing which the House of Lords held not to be adequate consideration in
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
(1884) 9 App Cas 605: see in particular p 622 per Lord Blackburn. There are arguable points of
distinction, although the arguments are somewhat forced. A differently constituted Court of Appeal made these
points in 
In re Selectmove Ltd
 
[1995] 1 WLR 474, and declined to follow 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey
. The reality is that
any decision on this point is likely to involve a re-examination of the decision in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
. It is probably
ripe for re-examination. But if it is to be overruled or its effect substantially modified, it should be before an
enlarged panel of the court and in a case where the decision would be more than obiter dictum.
Three points are worth noting here. First, Lord Sumption stated that the issue was a
‘difficult’ one, given that it involved not only a reconsideration of 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
but also
of 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros.
 
Secondly, the panel which had been convened for the
hearing was a panel of five judges when an enlarged panel would have been preferable,
given that one outcome might have been the decision to overrule 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
, a
decision of the House of Lords which has been a leading, if controversial, authority for
some 135 years. There is, of course, no guarantee that an enlarged panel will necessarily
produce a better outcome, but one can see the point that great care is needed before
overruling a decision of long-standing authority, and in such a case an enlarged panel
might reflect the importance of the issue to be decided. Thirdly, any consideration of the
issue by the Supreme Court would technically have been 
obiter
 
and this was believed to
be an unsatisfactory way of proceeding. These points clearly have substance but they
have the unfortunate consequence that we may have to wait a very long time before the
Supreme Court is given an opportunity to convene an enlarged panel in an appropriate
future case. There is a certain irony here. In 
Foakes
 
Lord Selbourne expressed a
reluctance to reverse ‘a doctrine which has been accepted as part of the law of England
for 280 years’. We can now add a further 135 years to that period. It would therefore
appear that the rule that part payment of a debt is not good consideration for the
discharge of the entire debt has survived not because it is believed to be correct in
principle, but simply by virtue of its longevity which has insulated it from serious
judicial scrutiny.
Were an appropriate case to come before the Supreme Court, how should it be decided?
It is difficult to say, but the predominant academic view is that it is 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
that
should give way and that the courts in future should apply a test based on the presence
or absence of practical benefit or detriment (subject to defences such as economic
duress). Not all are convinced of the wisdom of such a step (see, for example, J
O’Sullivan, ‘In Defence of 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
’ [1996] 
CLJ
 
219). The concerns surrounding
the application of the practical benefit test 
to the part payment of a debt are that the test
is too easy to satisfy and that the defences, such as duress, may not provide sufficient
protection for the creditor. Professor Treitel expresses some doubts about the reversal of
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
in the following terms (
Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract
Law
 
(Oxford University Press, 2002), pp. 45–46):
Would anything be lost if such a reversal took place? The rule no doubt has a protective function in cases such
as 
D & C Builders Ltd
 
v. 
Rees
, though in that kind of situation the same function could perhaps in many cases
be performed by the concept of economic duress. But that concept may not go far enough. There was, I repeat,
nothing wrong with the outcome in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
; and I do not see how the case could be brought within even
the expanding concept of duress; nor is it obvious what other legal machinery could be used to achieve the same
end. Rectification has been suggested as a possibility but this would work only if 
both
 
parties had no intention
that the interest should be given up or if Dr Foakes 
knew
 
that Mrs Beer had no such intention or if he was guilty
of fraud or other unconscionable conduct in procuring the agreement. But there was no evidence of any such
circumstances so that the problem cannot be solved in this way. There is much to be said against 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
but also something in its favour. How the balance will one day, perhaps in the twenty-first century, be struck
continues to be a matter of speculation.
5.2.3
 
Past Consideration
The general rule is that past consideration is not good consideration. The rule is linked
to the bargain theory of consideration. Take the following example. X washes Y’s car. Y
later promises to pay X £15 for washing his car but then changes his mind and refuses to
pay. Can X sue Y for the promised sum? The answer to this question ultimately depends
upon the evidence. If it is the case that there was an unexpressed bargain between X and
Y according to which X agreed to wash Y’s car in return for payment then the promise
will be enforceable (see later in this section). On the other hand, if X washed Y’s car and
Y then separately promised to pay X £15 then X will not be entitled to sue Y for payment
because the consideration that he provided for Y’s promise of payment, namely washing
the car, was in the past. It may be difficult to distinguish these two cases on the facts.
But the difference between them is essentially an evidential one relating to the nature of
the obligations assumed by the parties. The essence of the distinction is between a
bargain, on the one hand, and a gift which is followed by a promise to make a gift, on the
other. The former is enforceable while the latter is not. The general rule that past
consideration is not good consideration was established in two cases in the nineteenth
century, namely 
Eastwood
 
v. 
Kenyon
 
(1840) 11 Ad & E 438 and 
Roscorla
 
v. 
Thomas
(1842) 3 QB 234. Both cases have been the subject of criticism.
EASTWOOD V. KENYON
(1840) 11 Ad & E 438, Queen’s Bench
John Sutcliffe died and left his entire estate to his daughter, Sarah. The plaintiff
was Sutcliffe’s executor and he acted as Sarah’s agent and guardian until she
came of full age. Sutcliffe’s estate proved to be insufficient to cover the cost of
maintaining and educating 
Sarah and maintaining and improving some cottages
that had been left to Sarah. The plaintiff therefore borrowed £140 from Mr
Blackburn in order to meet these costs. This money was spent for the benefit of
Sarah and, after she came of full age, she promised to repay the £140 which the
plaintiff had borrowed and, indeed, she paid the interest to Blackburn for one year.
The plaintiff then gave up the control and management of the estate to Sarah’s
agent. Sarah later married the defendant and he in turn promised that he would
discharge the plaintiff’s liability to Blackburn. He failed to honour his promise but it
was held that he incurred no liability in failing to do so because his promise to pay
the debt which the plaintiff had incurred was unenforceable.
Lord Denman CJ
[delivering the judgment of the court]
It was … argued for the plaintiff that the declaration disclosed a sufficient moral
consideration to support the promise.
Most of the older cases on this subject are collected in a learned note to the
case of 
Wennall
 
v. 
Adney
 
(3 B & P 249), and the conclusion there arrived at seems
to be correct in general, ‘that an express promise can only revive a precedent good
consideration, which might have been enforced at law through the medium of an
implied promise, had it not been suspended by some positive rule of law; but can
give no original cause of action, if the obligation, on which it is founded, never
could have been enforced at law, though not barred by any legal maxim or statute
provision’. …
The eminent counsel who argued for the plaintiff in 
Lee
 
v. 
Muggeridge
 
(5 Taunt
36), spoke of Lord Mansfield as having considered the rule of 
nudum pactum
 
as
too narrow, and maintained that all promises deliberately made ought to be held
binding. I do not find this language ascribed to him by any reporter, and do not
know whether we are to receive it as a traditional report, or as a deduction from
what he does appear to have laid down. If the latter, the note to 
Wennall
 
v. 
Adney
(3 B & P 249), shews the deduction to be erroneous. If the former, Lord Tenterden
and this Court declared that they could not adopt it in 
Littlefield
 
v. 
Shee
 
(2 B & Ad
811). Indeed the doctrine would annihilate the necessity for any consideration at
all, inasmuch as the mere fact of giving a promise creates a moral obligation to
perform it.
The enforcement of such promises by law, however plausibly reconciled by the
desire to effect all conscientious engagements, might be attended with
mischievous consequences to society; one of which would be the frequent
preference of voluntary undertakings to claims for just debts. Suits would thereby
be multiplied, and voluntary undertakings would also be multiplied, to the prejudice
of real creditors. The temptations of executors would be much increased by the
prevalence of such a doctrine, and the faithful discharge of their duty be rendered
more difficult.
Taking then the promise of the defendant, as stated on this record, to have
been an express promise, we find that the consideration for it was past and
executed long before, and yet it is not laid to have been at the request of the
defendant, nor even of his wife while sole (though if it had, the case of 
Mitchinson
v. 
Hewson
 
(7 T R 348), shews that it would not have been sufficient), and the
declaration really discloses nothing but a benefit voluntarily conferred by the
plaintiff and received by the defendant, with an express promise by the defendant
to pay money.
If the subsequent assent of the defendant could have amounted to a ratihabitio
the declaration should have stated the money to have been expended at his
request, and 
the ratification should have been relied on as matter of evidence; but
this was obviously impossible, because the defendant was in no way connected
with the property or with the plaintiff, when the money was expended. If the
ratification of the wife while sole were relied on, then a debt from her would have
been shewn, and the defendant could not have been charged in his own right
without some further consideration, as of forbearance after marriage, or something
of that sort; and then another point would have arisen upon the Statute of Frauds
which did not arise as it was, but which might in that case have been available
under the plea of non assumpsit.
In holding this declaration bad because it states no consideration but a past
benefit not conferred at the request of the defendant, we conceive that we are
justified by the old common law of England.
Lampleigh
 
v. 
Brathwait
 
(Hob 105), is selected by Mr Smith (1 Smith’s Leading
Cases, 67), as the leading case on this subject, which was there fully discussed,
though not necessary to the decision. Hobart CJ lays it down that ‘a mere
voluntary courtesy will not have a consideration to uphold an assumpsit. But if that
courtesy were moved by a suit or request of the party that gives the assumpsit, it
will bind; for the promise, though it follows, yet it is not naked, but couples itself
with the suit before, and the merits of the party procured by that suit; which is the
difference’ …
Upon the whole, we are of opinion that the rule must be made absolute to
arrest the judgment.

Commentary
The language in which the judgment is expressed is not always easy to follow but this is
frequently so with reports that date from this period. 
Eastwood
 
is an important decision
for a number of reasons. The first relates to the conclusion that the consideration was
‘past and executed’ long before the express promise to pay was made. The plaintiff
performed services that were of value to Sarah and the defendant did promise to pay for
them but there was never a bargain between them to the effect that, if the plaintiff
performed these services, the defendant would pay for them. Rather, there was one
event, the loan taken out by the plaintiff for the benefit of Sarah, followed by a second
event, the promise by the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff, but no sufficient
connection between the two to constitute a bargain to this effect. The plaintiff had
conferred a gift on Sarah, and her husband, in gratitude or as a matter of moral
obligation (on which see later), had promised to repay the money borrowed, but the
latter promise was unenforceable in law.
Secondly, Lord Denman recognizes that the rule that past consideration is no
consideration is the subject of exceptions. He recognizes an exception, based on
Lampleigh
 
v. 
Brathwait
 
(1615) Hob 105 (discussed later in this section), where the
earlier act was performed at the request of the promisor. This exception was not
applicable on the facts of 
Eastwood
 
because the defendant had not asked the plaintiff to
borrow the money. Lord Denman also refers to the possibility of ratification, albeit he
rejects it on the facts. A party who ratifies an obligation which, prior to ratification, was
not (or no longer) binding on him may incur a liability in respect of that obligation as a
result of the ratification. The law in this area is, however, rather uneven. A debtor who
promises to pay a debt after it has become statute-barred does not thereby become liable
to repay the debt (Limitation Act 1980, section 29(7)). His ratification is ineffective to
revive the debt (unless his promise to pay the 
debt is supported by fresh consideration).
But the position is otherwise in the case of a child who ratifies a contract that was not
binding on him during his childhood. Children have limited contractual capacity and so
many contracts do not bind them during their childhood. But if a child, on reaching
adulthood, ratifies the contract he will generally become liable on it (
Williams
 
v. 
Moor
(1843) 11 M & W 256). In this way ratification can serve to give legal effect to an
obligation that was previously unenforceable. Thirdly, 
Eastwood
 
is of great significance
because of its rejection of the proposition, associated with Lord Mansfield, that a
promise to perform a pre-existing ‘moral obligation’ could constitute good
consideration. In this respect 
Eastwood
 
is something of a watershed. It provided the
court with an opportunity to abandon the doctrine of consideration but instead Lord
Denman used it to affirm the existence of the doctrine. The impact of 
Eastwood
 
has
been described by Professor Atiyah (
The Rise and Fall of Freedom of Contract
 
(Oxford
University Press, 1979), pp. 491–493) in the following terms:
There is no doubt that this is one of the most puzzling of all nineteenth-century decisions on contract law. Why
did the Court go out of its way to overrule decisions representing the law of some seventy years’ standing, when
the result seemed so unjust? Further, if … the whole trend of contract law had been to stress the importance of
the promissory basis, is it not passing strange that the Court should have invoked the doctrine of consideration
(which elsewhere had been reduced by this time to a bare technicality) to defeat a clear and express promise?
Moreover, the idea that this was a conservative decision, a return to the old, true, pre-Mansfield law, does not
square with what we know of Denman. For though Denman may not have had any great reputation as a lawyer,
he was by no means a conservative figure. He had spent many years as a fairly radical Whig in Parliament, was a
close associate of Brougham’s, and even while on the Bench, took an active part in many law reform proposals.
I suggest that three factors may have been responsible for the decision. First, there was the growing strength
of positivism which stressed the line between law and morality far more than had ever been the case in
Mansfield’s time. Positivism owed its origins to Bentham’s 
Fragment on Government
, but was given much
greater elaboration and force in Austin’s 
Province of Jurisprudence Determined
, first published in 1832.
Austin, it must be remembered was a member of the Benthamite circle, on the outer fringes of which had been
Denman himself before he became Chief Justice. Denman may have been acquainted with Austin, and, more
likely, with his work. It does not seem unduly speculative to suggest that the Court was unhappy at the idea of
having openly to convert moral obligations into legal ones.
The second factor is less obvious, and more dubious, but I suggest that there is a sense in which the decision
was part of the process of downgrading quasi-contractual duties, liabilities not based on consent, which was
such a pronounced feature of the times. The fact that in the case itself there was an express promise is no doubt
paradoxical, but the point is that the original benefit received by Sarah was not at that time the subject of any
promise to pay, either by Sarah or by her husband. If there had been any quasi-contractual duty on Sarah to
reimburse the plaintiff for his expenditure, then there is no doubt that she at least would have been
subsequently liable on her promise. The Court stressed the rule that where a benefit is rendered in
circumstances which create a legal liability to pay without any promise, then a subsequent promise is itself
binding and the past consideration is treated as good. In a sense, therefore, the importance of the decision may
lie not so much in the denial of liability 
on the express promise, but in the denial of any pre-existing quasi-
contractual duty. … Now we have seen how, around 1840, the Courts were cutting down on such [quasi-
contractual] liabilities. A man was not to be held liable for some benefit conferred upon his wife or his child,
unless authorized by him. And in 
Eastwood
 
v. 
Kenyon
 
the Court appears to be insisting that the authority must
be contemporaneous with the conferring of the benefit. Benefits are not to be thrust upon people behind their
backs, and then promises afterwards extracted from them.
The third possible factor which may have contributed to the decision in 
Eastwood
 
v. 
Kenyon
 
was the
disappearance of the idea that the binding nature of a promise rested upon some pre-existing obligation. This is
shown by the fact that Lord Denman rejects the argument that a moral obligation can amount to a
consideration by arguing that all promises anyhow give rise to moral obligations, and the doctrine, literally
applied, would eliminate the need for consideration altogether.
ROSCORLA V. THOMAS
(1842) 3 QB 234, Queen’s Bench
The plaintiff bought a horse from the defendant for £30. The defendant gave to the
plaintiff an oral warranty that the horse was sound and free from vice. The plaintiff
brought an action against the defendant, alleging a breach of this oral warranty. It
was held that the oral warranty was unenforceable for want of consideration. The
consideration which supported the contract for the sale of the horse was
insufficient to support the subsequent oral warranty.
Lord Denman CJ
It may be taken as a general rule, subject to exceptions not applicable to this case,
that the promise must be coextensive with the consideration. In the present case,
the only promise that would result from the consideration, as stated, and be
coextensive with it, would be to deliver the horse upon request. The precedent
sale, without a warranty, though at the request of the defendant, imposes no other
duty or obligation upon him. It is clear, therefore, that the consideration stated
would not raise an implied promise by the defendant that the horse was sound or
free from vice.
But the promise in the present case must be taken to be, as in fact it was,
express and the question is, whether that fact will warrant the extension of the
promise beyond that which would be implied by law; and whether the
consideration, though insufficient to raise an implied promise, will nevertheless
support an express one. And we think that it will not.
The cases in which it has been held that, under certain circumstances, a
consideration insufficient to raise an implied promise will nevertheless support an
express one, will be found collected and reviewed in the note (a) to 
Wennall
 
v.
Adney
 
(3 Bos & Pul 249), and in the case of 
Eastwood
 
v. 
Kenyon
 
(11 A & E 438).
They are cases of voidable contracts subsequently ratified, of debts barred by
operation of law, subsequently revived, and of equitable and moral obligations,
which, but for some rule of law, would of themselves have been sufficient to raise
an implied promise. All these cases are distinguishable from, and indeed
inapplicable to, the present, which appears to us to fall within the general rule, that
a consideration past and executed will support no other promise than such as
would be implied by law.
Commentary
This is another decision of Lord Denman, decided shortly after 
Eastwood
. At the time it
was decided there was no implied obligation of quality in horse sales (see P Mitchell,
‘The Development of Quality Obligations in Sale of Goods’ (2001) 117 
LQR
 
645, esp. pp.
645–650). Therefore, the only basis upon which the plaintiff could bring a claim against
the defendant was on the basis of the express oral warranty given by the defendant. But
the consideration provided by the plaintiff in entering into the contract of sale was
insufficient to support the oral warranty because that consideration was held to be ‘past
and executed’. There is, however, one problem with the case and that relates to the time
at which the oral warranty was given. It would appear from this report that the warranty
was given after the conclusion of the contract of sale but it has been pointed out (H
Beale (ed), 
Chitty on Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021), para 6–029 fn 144)
that, according to another report of the case ((1842) 11 LJQB 214, 215), the oral warranty
was given at the time of the sale. If this was the case it makes the conclusion that the
consideration was past much more difficult to defend (although Professor Treitel states
that the result in the case can nevertheless be justified on the ground that the oral
warranty was, at the time, void for want of written evidence).
The outcome in 
Roscorla
 
might be thought to be an unsatisfactory one. The court could,
perhaps, have taken the view that the oral warranty was part and parcel of one overall
transaction. Such a view has been taken in other cases (see, for example, 
Thornton
 
v.
Jenyns
 
(1840) 1 M & G 166, 188–189). Thus a guarantee given after the conclusion of a
contract for the sale of goods is not necessarily unenforceable on the ground that the
consideration alleged to support it (entry into the contract of sale) is past. A court is
more likely to conclude that there is but one transaction and that entry into the contract
of sale is good consideration for the guarantee.
Finally, in relation to 
Roscorla
 
it should be noted that Lord Denman, once again, refers
to the ratification cases as an exception to the general rule, albeit that they were not
applicable on the facts of the case.
Eastwood
 
and 
Roscorla
 
between them established the general rule that past
consideration is not good consideration. When deciding whether or not consideration is
past the courts have regard to what has actually happened. They do not rely exclusively
on the terms of the contract between the parties. Thus in 
Re McArdle
 
[1951] Ch 669 the
document stated that payment would be to Mrs McArdle ‘IN CONSIDERATION of your
carrying out certain alterations and improvements’ to some property. The evidence
established that all the work had in fact been done prior to the execution of the deed and
that this fact was ‘well-known to everybody who signed it’. The Court of Appeal held that
Mrs McArdle could not show that she had provided consideration for the promise of
payment because the ‘consideration was wholly past’.
As has been noted, the rule that past consideration is not good consideration is not
absolute. There are exceptions. In the first place the court may be able to conclude on
the evidence that the consideration was not in fact past because the later promise was
part and parcel of one overall transaction (
Classic Maritime Inc
 
v. 
Lion Diversified
Holdings Berhad
 
[2009] EWHC 1142 (Comm), [2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 59, [43]–[46]).
Secondly, section 27(1)(b) of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882 provides that an ‘antecedent
debt or liability’ constitutes valuable consideration for a bill of exchange and the effect of
this subsection is, potentially, to render past consideration good consideration (although
in most cases involving bills of exchange the consideration is not in fact past). The
principal exception consists of a line of cases that originated with the old case of
Lampleigh
 
v. 
Brathwait
 
(1615) Hob 105 and was restated in 
modern form by the Privy
Council in 
Pao On
 
v. 
Lau Yiu Long
 
[1980] AC 614. The facts of this case are rather
complex but factual complexity is the hallmark of many modern commercial
transactions. It is therefore important to work through the facts of the case with some
care.
PAO ON V. LAU YIU LONG
[1980] AC 614, Privy Council
The plaintiffs were the owners of all the shares of a company called Shing On,
while the defendants were the majority shareholders in Fu Chip, a company which
‘went public’ on 9 February 1973. The principal asset owned by Shing On was a
building which the defendants wished to acquire. At the same time, the plaintiffs
wished to realize the value of the property by selling the shares in Shing On. So
the parties agreed that the plaintiffs would sell the shares in Shing On to Fu Chip,
the price payable to be met by the allotment to the plaintiffs of 4.2 million ordinary
shares of $1 each in Fu Chip. It was agreed that the market value of each Fu Chip
share was to be deemed to be $2.50, and the plaintiffs also agreed that they would
not, before the end of April 1974, sell or transfer 2.5 million of the shares so
transferred. This restriction was imposed in order to prevent a depression in the
value of Fu Chip shares caused by heavy selling of the shares. The difficulty which
this restriction posed for the plaintiffs was that their inability to sell the shares
exposed them to the risk of any drop in their value. In order to reduce this
exposure, the parties entered into a subsidiary agreement under which the
defendants agreed, on or before the end of April 1974, to buy back the shares at
$2.50 per share. However, this agreement operated to the advantage of the
defendants because they could require the plaintiffs to sell them the shares for
$2.50 even if the market value of the shares had risen beyond $2.50. When the
plaintiffs discovered this, they informed the defendants that they would not perform
the main agreement unless the subsidiary agreement was cancelled and replaced
by a guarantee which only came into operation in the event of the price of the
shares falling below $2.50. The defendants were anxious to complete the
transaction so that public confidence in the newly formed company was not
undermined, and so they agreed to the terms proposed by the plaintiffs and the
guarantee was duly executed on 4 May 1973. The price of Fu Chip shares
subsequently slumped on the market and the plaintiffs sought to enforce the
guarantee against the defendants. The defendants maintained that the guarantee
was unenforceable because it was not supported by consideration and had been
procured by duress. The Privy Council rejected the defendants’ argument and held
that the guarantee was supported by consideration and that there had been no
operative duress because the defendants could not show that their will had been
coerced such as to vitiate their consent. In this extract we are only concerned with
the first question which was asked of the Privy Council, namely whether or not the
guarantee was supported by consideration.
Lord Scarman
[giving the judgment of the Board]
The first question
The first question is whether upon its true construction the written guarantee of
May 4, 1973, states a consideration sufficient in law to support the defendants’
promise of indemnity against a fall in value of the Fu Chip shares. The instrument
is, so far as relevant, in these terms:
‘Re: Tsuen Wan Shing On Estate Co Ltd
In consideration of your having at our request agreed to sell all of your shares of and in the above
mentioned company whose registered office is situate at 274 Sha Tsui Road Ground Floor, Tsuen Wan
New Territories in the colony of Hong Kong for the consideration of $10,500,000: by the allotment of
4,200,000 ordinary shares of $1.00 each in Fu Chip Investment Co Ltd whose registered office is situate
at no. 33 Wing Lok Street Victoria in the said colony of Hong Kong and that the market value for the said
ordinary shares of the said Fu Chip Investment Co Ltd shall be deemed as $2.50 for each of $1.00 share
under an agreement for sale and purchase made between the parties thereto and dated February 27,
1973, we Lau Yiu Long ( … ) of no. 152 Tin Hau Temple Road, Flat C1, Summit Court, 14th floor in the
colony of Hong Kong merchant and Benjamin Lau Kam Ching ( … ) of no. 31 Ming Yuen Street West,
basement in the said colony of Hong Kong merchant the directors of the said Fu Chip Investment Co Ltd
hereby agree and guarantee the closing market value for 2,520,000 shares (being 60 per cent. of the
said 4,200,000 ordinary shares) of the said Fu Chip Investment Co Ltd shall be at $2.50 per share and
that the total value of 2,520,000 shares shall be of the sum of HK$6,300,000 on the following marketing
date immediately after April 30, 1974, and we further agree to indemnify and keep you indemnified
against any damages, losses and other expenses which you may incur or sustain in the event of the
closing market price for the shares of Fu Chip Investment Co Ltd according to the Far East Exchange
Ltd, shall fall short of the sum of $2.50 during the said following marketing date immediately after April
30, 1974, provided always that if we were called upon to indemnify you for the discrepancy between the
market value and the said total value of HK$6,300,000 we shall have the option of buying from you the
said 2,520,000 shares of Fu Chip Investment Co Ltd at the price of HK$6,300,000 … ’
…
Mr Neill, counsel for the plaintiffs, … contends that the consideration stated in
the agreement is not in reality a past one. It is to be noted that the consideration
was not on May 4, 1973, a matter of history only. The instrument by its reference to
the main agreement with Fu Chip incorporates as part of the stated consideration
the plaintiffs’ three promises to Fu Chip: to complete the sale of Shing On, to
accept shares as the price for the sale, and not to sell 60 per cent. of the shares so
accepted before April 30, 1974. Thus, on May 4, 1973, the performance of the
main agreement still lay in the future. Performance of these promises was of great
importance to the defendants, and it is undeniable that, as the instrument declares,
the promises were made to Fu Chip at the request of the defendants. It is equally
clear that the instrument also includes a promise by the plaintiffs to the defendants
to fulfil their earlier promises given to Fu Chip.
The Board agrees … that the consideration expressly stated in the written
guarantee is sufficient in law to support the defendants’ promise of indemnity. An
act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to confer some other
benefit can sometimes be consideration for the promise. The act must have been
done at the promisors’ request: the parties must have understood that the act was
to be remunerated either by a payment or the conferment of some other benefit:
and payment, or the conferment of a benefit, must have been legally enforceable
had it been promised in advance. All three features are present in this case. The
promise given to Fu Chip under the main agreement not to sell the shares for a
year was at the first defendant’s request. The parties understood at the time of the
main agreement that the restriction on selling must be compensated for by the
benefit of a guarantee against a drop in price: and such a guarantee would be
legally enforceable. 
The agreed cancellation of the subsidiary agreement left, as
the parties knew, the plaintiffs unprotected in a respect in which at the time of the
main agreement all were agreed they should be protected.
Mr Neill’s submission is based on 
Lampleigh
 
v. 
Brathwait
 
(1615) Hobart 105. In
that case the judges said, at p. 106:
‘First … a meer voluntary courtesie will not have a consideration to uphold an assumpsit. But if that
courtesie were moved by a suit or request of the party that gives the assumpsit, it will bind, for the
promise, though it follows, yet it is not naked, but couples itself with the suit before, and the merits of the
party procured by that suit, which is the difference.’
The modern statement of the law is in the judgment of Bowen LJ in 
In re Casey’s
Patents
 
[1892] 1 Ch 104, 115–116; Bowen LJ said:
‘Even if it were true, as some scientific students of law believe, that a past service cannot support a
future promise, you must look at the document and see if the promise cannot receive a proper effect in
some other way. Now, the fact of a past service raises an implication that at the time it was rendered it
was to be paid for, and, if it was a service which was to be paid for, when you get in the subsequent
document a promise to pay, that promise may be treated either as an admission which evidences or as a
positive bargain which fixes the amount of that reasonable remuneration on the faith of which the service
was originally rendered. So that here for past services there is ample justification for the promise to give
the third share.’
Conferring a benefit is, of course, an equivalent to payment …
Mr. Leggatt, for the defendants, does not dispute the existence of the rule but
challenges its application to the facts of this case. He submits that it is not a
necessary inference or implication from the terms of the written guarantee that any
benefit or protection was to be given to the plaintiffs for their acceptance of the
restriction on selling their shares. Their Lordships agree that the mere existence or
recital of a prior request is not sufficient in itself to convert what is prima facie past
consideration into sufficient consideration in law to support a promise: as they have
indicated, it is only the first of three necessary preconditions. As for the second of
those preconditions, whether the act done at the request of the promisor raises an
implication of promised remuneration or other return is simply one of the
construction of the words of the contract in the circumstances of its making. Once
it is recognised, as the Board considers it inevitably must be, that the expressed
consideration includes a reference to the plaintiffs’ promise not to sell the shares
before April 30, 1974—a promise to be performed in the future, though given in the
past—it is not possible to treat the defendants’ promise of indemnity as
independent of the plaintiffs’ antecedent promise, given at the first defendant’s
request, not to sell. The promise of indemnity was given because at the time of the
main agreement the parties intended that the first defendant should confer upon
the plaintiffs the benefit of his protection against a fall in price. When the subsidiary
agreement was cancelled, all were well aware that the plaintiffs were still to have
the benefit of his protection as consideration for the restriction on selling. It matters
not whether the indemnity thus given be regarded as the best evidence of the
benefit intended to be conferred in return for the promise not to sell, or as the
positive bargain which fixes the benefit on the faith of which the promise was given
—though where, as here, the subject is a written contract, the better analysis is
probably that of the ‘positive bargain’. Their Lordships, therefore, accept the
submission that the contract itself states a valid consideration for the promise of
indemnity.
Commentary
In this extract Lord Scarman identifies the three elements that must be satisfied by a
claimant who wishes to invoke this exception to the past consideration rule. The
claimant must show: (i) that he performed the original act at the request of the
defendant, (ii) that it was clearly understood or implied between the parties when the
act was requested that the claimant would be paid for doing the act, and (iii) the
defendant’s promise of payment must have been one which, had it been made prior to or
at the time at which the claimant performed the act in question, it would have been
enforceable. All three conditions were satisfied on the facts of this case.
Pao On
 
is an important case for a number of other reasons and, indeed, we have already
encountered the case on two occasions. First, the case illustrates the rule that a promise
to perform, or the performance of, a pre-existing contractual obligation owed to a third
party can be valid consideration (see 
5.2.2.1
). Thus Lord Scarman stated that ‘the
consideration for the promise of indemnity, while it included the cancellation of the
subsidiary agreement, was primarily the promise given by [the plaintiffs] to [the
defendants], to perform their contract with Fu Chip, which included the undertaking not
to sell 60% of the shares allotted to them before 30 April 1974’. Fu Chip was a third
party for the purposes of this rule notwithstanding the fact that the defendants were the
major shareholders in Fu Chip (a company being in law a separate entity from its
shareholders). Secondly, the case is notable for its rejection of the plaintiffs’ submission
that the consideration supplied by the defendants was illegal as being against public
policy. The reasons given by Lord Scarman for rejecting this submission are set out in
the judgment of Glidewell LJ in 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
 
(
5.2.2.3.2
). Thirdly (and a point
that we have not yet encountered), the case is notable for its recognition of the fact that
‘there is nothing contrary to principle in recognizing economic duress as a factor which
may render a contract voidable, provided always that the basis of such recognition is
that it must amount to a coercion of the will, which vitiates consent’. However, on the
facts of the case it was found that the plaintiffs could not establish that they had entered
into the guarantee under duress.
5.2.4
 
Consideration Must Move from the Promisee
Finally, consideration must move from the promisee and not from a third party; that is
to say the promisee rather than a third party must provide the consideration. The rule
does not require that the consideration move to the promisor. It suffices that it moves
from the promisee. Thus the rule is satisfied in the case where the promisee agrees to
confer a benefit on a third party at the request of the promisor (see 
Bolton
 
v. 
Madden
(1873) LR 9 QB 55). This is the rule at common law but it must now be read in the light
of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 which confers on third parties a
limited right to enforce a term in a contract between two (or more) other parties
provided that certain conditions have been satisfied (on which see 
Chapter 25
). A third
party who is given a right to enforce a term of the contract by the Act does not have to
provide consideration in order to be able to enforce his right. The fact that the Act
confers a right of action is sufficient to displace the requirement that he provide
consideration.
5.2.5
 
Establishing the Necessary Link
What link or connection must there be between the act alleged to constitute the
consideration and the promise made by the other party? The link is generally provided
by the terms of the promise itself. A simple example will illustrate the point. Suppose
that A promises to 
pay £5 to B if he will take him to the train station. In such a case B’s
act of taking A to the station is the consideration for A’s promise of payment. But
suppose that A promises to pay B £5 but makes no mention of a lift to the station. B
nevertheless provides A with a lift to the station. In such a case can B claim that he has
provided consideration in giving A a lift to the station? Prima facie the answer is no. In
order to constitute consideration the act must have been performed at the request,
express or implied, of the promisor. Thus B would have to show that A, in making the
promise of payment, expressly or impliedly requested B to give him a lift to the station:
it would not be enough for B to show that it was reasonably foreseeable that he would
give A a lift to the station as a result of the promise of payment. This point is an
important one because it bears directly on the scope of the doctrine of consideration. A
court that is willing to imply a request by A that B act in a particular way will generally
find the existence of consideration and so will not have any need to resort to estoppel.
But a finding that there is no sufficient link between the promise of A and the act of B
will generally result in a finding that no consideration has been supplied, and the court
may then be asked to find the existence of an estoppel in order to give effect to A’s
promise. The following case illustrates these points:
COMBE V. COMBE
[1951] 2 KB 215, Court of Appeal
The plaintiff (the wife) and the defendant (the husband) were married in 1915 and
separated in 1939. On 1 February 1943 a decree nisi of divorce was pronounced
on the plaintiff’s application. Later that month the defendant’s solicitor wrote to the
plaintiff’s solicitor and stated that the defendant had agreed to allow the plaintiff
£100 per annum free of tax. On 11 August 1943 the decree was made absolute.
The defendant failed to make any of the promised payments. The plaintiff pressed
for payment but made no application to the Divorce Court for maintenance. The
plaintiff’s annual income was between £700 and £800 per year, while the
defendant’s annual income was in the region of £650. In July 1950 the plaintiff
brought an action against the defendant in which she claimed arrears of £675.
Byrne J held that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the first three instalments
of £25 (on the ground that the limitation period had expired and the claim in
respect of them was time-barred) but he held that the plaintiff was entitled to
recover the remaining £600 from the defendant. He held that, while the plaintiff had
not provided any consideration for the defendant’s promise of payment, she was
entitled to succeed in her claim on the ground that it fell within the scope of the
principle laid down by Denning J in 
Central London Property Trust Ltd
 
v. 
High
Trees House Ltd
 
[1947] KB 130 [see 
5.3.2
] and 
Robertson
 
v. 
Minister of Pensions
[1949] 1 KB 227. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of
Appeal affirmed the decision of Byrne J in so far as he held that the plaintiff had
not provided any consideration for the defendant’s promise but allowed the appeal
on the ground that the 
High Trees
 
principle could not be used so as to confer a
cause of action on the plaintiff.
Denning LJ
[after stating the facts continued]
Much as I am inclined to favour the principle stated in the 
High Trees
 
case
[1947] KB 130, it is important that it should not be stretched too far, lest it should
be endangered. That principle does not create new causes of action where none
existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting upon his strict legal rights,
when it would be unjust to allow him to 
enforce them, having regard to the dealings
which have taken place between the parties. That is the way it was put in 
Hughes
v. 
Metropolitan Railway
 
(1877) 2 App Cas 439, 448, the case in the House of Lords
in which the principle was first stated, and in 
Birmingham, etc., Land Company
 
v.
London and North-Western Railway Co
 
(1888) 40 Ch D 268, 286, the case in the
Court of Appeal where the principle was enlarged. It is also implicit in all the
modern cases in which the principle has been developed. Sometimes it is a plaintiff
who is not allowed to insist on his strict legal rights. Thus, a creditor is not allowed
to enforce a debt which he has deliberately agreed to waive, if the debtor has
carried on business or in some other way changed his position in reliance on the
waiver. … On other occasions it is a defendant who is not allowed to insist on his
strict legal rights. His conduct may be such as to debar him from relying on some
condition, denying some allegation, or taking some other point in answer to the
claim. Thus a government department, which had accepted a disease as due to
war service, were not allowed afterwards to say it was not, seeing that the soldier,
in reliance on the assurance, had abstained from getting further evidence about it:
Robertson
 
v. 
Minister of Pensions
 
[1949] 1 KB 227. … In none of these cases was
the defendant sued on the promise, assurance, or assertion as a cause of action in
itself: he was sued for some other cause, for example, a pension or a breach of
contract, and the promise, assurance or assertion only played a supplementary
role—an important role, no doubt, but still a supplementary role. That is, I think, its
true function. It may be part of a cause of action, but not a cause of action in itself.
The principle, as I understand it, is that, where one party has, by his words or
conduct, made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect
the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once the
other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the one who gave the
promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal
relations as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but he must
accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so
introduced, even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration but
only by his word.
Seeing that the principle never stands alone as giving a cause of action in itself,
it can never do away with the necessity of consideration when that is an essential
part of the cause of action. The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be
overthrown by a side-wind. Its ill-effects have been largely mitigated of late, but it
still remains a cardinal necessity of the formation of a contract, though not of its
modification or discharge. I fear that it was my failure to make this clear which
misled Byrne J, in the present case. He held that the wife could sue on the
husband’s promise as a separate and independent cause of action by itself,
although, as he held, there was no consideration for it. That is not correct. The wife
can only enforce it if there was consideration for it. That is, therefore, the real
question in the case: was there sufficient consideration to support the promise?
If it were suggested that, in return for the husband’s promise, the wife expressly
or impliedly promised to forbear from applying to the court for maintenance—that
is, a promise in return for a promise—there would clearly be no consideration,
because the wife’s promise was not binding on her and was therefore worth
nothing. Notwithstanding her promise, she could always apply to the Divorce Court
for maintenance—maybe only with leave—and no agreement by her could take
away that right. …
There was, however, clearly no promise by the wife, express or implied, to
forbear from applying to the court. All that happened was that she did in fact
forbear—that is, she did an act in return for a promise. Is that sufficient
consideration? Unilateral promises of this kind have long been enforced, so long
as the act or forbearance is done on the faith of the promise 
and at the request of
the promisor, express or implied. The act done is then in itself sufficient
consideration for the promise, even though it arises ex post facto. … If the findings
of Byrne J were accepted, they would be sufficient to bring this principle into play.
His finding that the husband’s promise was intended to be binding, intended to be
acted upon, and was, in fact, acted on—although expressed to be a finding on the
High Trees
 
principle—is equivalent to a finding that there was consideration within
this long settled rule, because it comes to the same thing expressed in different
words. … But my difficulty is to accept the finding of Byrne J, that the promise was
‘intended to be acted upon’. I cannot find any evidence of any intention by the
husband that the wife should forbear from applying to the court for maintenance,
or, in other words, any request by the husband, express or implied, that the wife
should so forbear. He left her to apply if she wished to do so. She did not do so,
and I am not surprised, because it is very unlikely that the Divorce Court would
have then made any order in her favour, seeing that she had a bigger income than
her husband. Her forbearance was not intended by him, nor was it done at his
request. It was therefore no consideration.
It may be that the wife has suffered some detriment because, after forbearing to
apply to the court for seven years, she might not now be given leave to apply. …
The court is, however, nowadays much more ready to give leave than it used to be
…, and I should have thought that, if she fell on hard times, she would still obtain
leave. Assuming, however, that she has suffered some detriment by her
forbearance, nevertheless, as the forbearance was not at the husband’s request, it
is no consideration. … The doctrine of consideration is sometimes said to work
injustice, but I see none in this case. … I do not think it would be right for this wife,
who is better off than her husband, to take no action for six or seven years and
then come down on him for the whole £600.
The truth is that in these maintenance cases the real remedy of the wife is, not
by action in the King’s Bench Division, but by application in the Divorce Court. I
have always understood that no agreement for maintenance, which is made in the
course of divorce proceedings prior to decree absolute, is valid unless it is
sanctioned by the court. … I know that such agreements are often made, but their
only valid purpose is to serve as a basis for a consent application to the court. The
reason why such agreements are invalid, unless approved, is because they are so
apt to be collusive. Some wives are tempted to stipulate for extortionate
maintenance as the price of giving the husband his freedom. It is to remove this
temptation that the sanction of the court is required. It would be a great pity if this
salutary requirement could be evaded by taking action in the King’s Bench
Division. The Divorce Court can order the husband to pay whatever maintenance
is just. Moreover, if justice so requires, it can make the order retrospective to
decree absolute. That is the proper remedy of the wife here, and I do not think she
has a right to any other.
Asquith LJ
The judge has decided that, while the husband’s promise was unsupported by any
valid consideration, yet the principle in 
Central London Property Trust Ltd
 
v. 
High
Trees House Ltd
 
[1947] KB 130 entitles the wife to succeed. It is unnecessary to
express any view as to the correctness of that decision, though I certainly must not
be taken to be questioning it; and I would remark, in passing, that it seems to me a
complete misconception to suppose that it struck at the roots of the doctrine of
consideration. But assuming, without deciding, that it is good law, I do not think,
however, that it helps the plaintiff at all. What that case decides is that when a
promise is given which (1.) is intended to create legal relations, (2.) is intended to
be acted upon by the promisee, and (3.) is in fact so acted upon, the promisor
cannot bring an action against the promisee which involves the repudiation of his
promise or is inconsistent with it. It does not, as I read it, decide that a promisee
can sue on the promise. On the contrary, Denning, J, expressly stated the contrary.
Neither in the 
High Trees
 
case nor in 
Minister of Pensions
 
v. 
Robertson
 
[1949] 1
KB 227 (another decision of my Lord which is relied upon by the plaintiff) was an
action brought by the promisee on the promise. In the first of those two cases the
plaintiff was in effect the promisor or a person standing in the shoes of the
promisor, while in the second the claim, though brought by the promisee, was
brought upon a cause of action which was not the promise, but was an alleged
statutory right …
Finally, I do not think an actual forbearance, as opposed to an agreement to
forbear to approach the court, is a good consideration unless it proceeds from a
request, express or implied, on the part of the promisor. If not moved by such a
request, the forbearance is not in respect of the promise.
Birkett LJ
 
delivered a concurring judgment.
Commentary
There are two central aspects to this decision. The first relates to the finding that the
plaintiff did not provide any consideration for the defendant’s promise of payment and
the second relates to the scope of the principle laid down in 
High Trees
 
(see 
5.3.2
). We
shall explore the second issue in greater detail when we examine 
High Trees
 
in the
section on estoppel. Here our focus is confined to the first issue.
Why did the Court of Appeal not conclude that the plaintiff had provided consideration
for the defendant’s promise? Could the court not have found that the defendant
impliedly requested the plaintiff to refrain from applying for maintenance? Professor
Goodhart (1951) 67 
LQR
 
456, 458 made the following comments in relation to the facts
of 
Combe
:
To suggest that this might be an offer of a generous gift on the part of a guilty but repentant husband would be
to place a considerable burden on one’s credulity. It cannot be believed that the husband was promising to pay
the wife £100 per year even though she should make an application to the court for maintenance. In 
Alliance
Bank
 
v. 
Broom
 
(1864) 2 Dr & Sim 289 the court said that ‘although there was no promise on the part of the
plaintiff to abstain for any certain time from suing for the debt, the effect was that the plaintiff did, in fact, give,
and the defendant receive, the benefit of some degree of forbearance’. It is not unreasonable to suggest that in
the present case the husband was offering to pay £100 per year in return for the wife’s forbearance.
While it may not be unreasonable to suggest that the husband was offering to pay £100
per year in return for the wife’s forbearance, this was not the construction adopted by
the Court of Appeal on the facts. It has to be remembered that 
Combe
 
is, essentially, a
family law case and it was heavily influenced by the procedure then applicable to divorce
proceedings. Thus, writing extrajudicially, Lord Denning stated (‘Recent Developments
in the Doctrine of Consideration’ (1952) 15 
MLR
 
1, 2) that the defendant’s statement that
he would pay £100 per annum to his wife:
did not mean that she should forbear from applying for maintenance. It is well known that agreements of that
kind are made as a preliminary to an application for maintenance. They form the basis for a consent order to be
approved by the court. The agreement, therefore, so far from being an implied request to forbear from applying
to the court, was almost an invitation to her to apply to the court. Her forbearance was therefore no
consideration.
An alternative explanation for the court’s refusal to imply a request has been provided
by Professor Atiyah in the following terms (‘Consideration: A Restatement’ in Atiyah,
Essays on Contract
 
(Oxford University Press, 1986), pp. 179, 231). He argues that the
court could have implied a request ‘without doing the least violence to the facts’ but that
it did not do so because the justice of the case did not require it. The justice of the case
did not support the plaintiff for two reasons. The first was that her income was greater
than her husband’s and the second was that she was attempting to recover a lump sum
of £600 from the defendant and not seeking to enforce his promise to pay £100 per
annum.
However, Professor Goodhart’s citation of 
Alliance Bank
 
v. 
Broom
 
demonstrates that
cases can be found in which the courts have been prepared to imply a request. In
Alliance Bank
 
the defendant, who was heavily indebted to the plaintiff bank, promised
to provide the bank with security to cover his indebtedness. He failed to provide the
promised security and, when sued by the bank, submitted that his promise to provide
security was not supported by consideration. It was held that the bank had in fact
provided consideration in that it had refrained from taking proceedings against the
defendant in relation to his indebtedness. This forbearance was held to be at the implied
request of the defendant. The willingness of a court to imply a request will very much
depend upon the facts and circumstances of the individual case. The bank in 
Alliance
Bank
 
was, in all probability, much more likely to institute proceedings than the wife in
Combe
 
and, this being the case, the court doubtless found it easier to imply that the
defendant had requested the bank not to sue him on the debt provided that he gave the
bank security. The readier the court is to find the existence of such a request, the wider
will be the doctrine of consideration and, in consequence, the less need there will be to
invoke estoppel.
 
In most cases it is not necessary to distinguish between the two categories because both suffice to render a promise
enforceable. However, in some transactions relating to the disposition of interests in land it may be necessary to

Estoppel: Its Scope
We have encountered estoppel at various points in this chapter (in the judgments in
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 1 (see 
5.2.2.3.2
) and
Combe
 
v. 
Combe
 
[1951] 2 KB 215 (see 
5.2.5
)) but have not as yet sought to define it or to
ascertain its scope. Estoppels come in different shapes and sizes. Our concern in this
chapter is not to survey the whole range of estoppels but rather to examine the role
which estoppel plays, or can play, in giving legal effect to a promise that is unsupported
by consideration. Take 
Combe
 
v. 
Combe
 
as an example. The wife’s claim that she had
provided consideration for her husband’s promise to pay her £100 per year failed. But
she had a second string to her bow. She argued that her husband was estopped, or
prevented, from going back upon his promise to pay her £100 per year. As it happened,
her estoppel claim failed but the case nevertheless illustrates the way in which estoppel
is invoked by litigants who are unable to establish that the promise upon which they
base their claim, or defence, is supported by consideration. Two cases feature
prominently in the development of the doctrine of estoppel. These cases are

Combe
.
Given their significance in the development of the law we shall examine them in more
detail after first giving a brief definition of the meaning of the word estoppel.
5.3.1
 
Estoppel: A Brief Definition
Estoppel is not a word that is used in everyday conversation. What does it mean? A
dictionary definition states that it means an obstruction and the example given is of an
obstruction of a waterway. In legal terms an estoppel has been described as an
impediment or bar to a right of action arising from a man’s own act as, for example,
where a man is forbidden by law to speak against his own deed. A fuller definition of
estoppel has been provided in the following terms:
E COOKE, 
THE MODERN LAW OF ESTOPPEL
(Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 1–2
Estoppel is a mechanism for enforcing consistency; when I have said or done
something that leads you to believe in a particular state of affairs, I may be obliged
to stand by what I have said or done, even though I am not contractually bound to
do so.
It is perhaps easiest to begin with examples. If your bank pays money into your
account by mistake, it may be estopped from telling you later that it is not yours
and demanding repayment—but only if it has assured you that the money is yours,
and you have relied on that by spending the money. The parties to a commercial
deal might agree: ‘we’ll treat clause 2 as meaning such-and-such’; if they go ahead
with the deal on that basis, they have to abide by that agreement if the
construction of the document is disputed later. A landlord might reassure his
tenant: ‘I will not insist that you pay for the roof repairs, even though your lease
obliges you to do so’; he may then be estopped from going back on that promise
and demanding payment. The idea running through these examples is of making
the person concerned work on the basis that what he has said is true, even if it is
not.
Estoppel has been described as ‘a simple and wholly untechnical conception,
perhaps the most powerful and flexible instrument to be found in any system of
court jurisprudence’. It is not easy to frame a definition of estoppel, in the sense of
a neat formula that will tell us whether or not a given set of facts is an instance of
estoppel. Lord Denning’s description of the doctrine is both informative and brief:
‘Estoppel … is a principle of justice and of equity. It comes to this: when a man, by his words or conduct,
has led another to believe in a particular state of affairs, he will not be allowed to go back on it when it
would be unjust or inequitable for him to do so.’
A number of features should be noted about this passage. The first is that, as a
definition, it is lacking in precision. It makes use of broad standards such as ‘justice’ and
‘equity’. Its emphasis on flexibility echoes a recurrent theme in legal writing, both
judicial and academic, on estoppel. Not everyone approves of this flexibility. Professor
Birks launched an attack on it in the following terms (‘Equity in the Modern Law: An
Exercise in Taxonomy’ (1996) 26 
University of Western Australia Law Review
 
1, 21–
22):
‘Estoppel’ is by origin a common law word. But ever since, in imitation of American law, the 
High Trees
 
case set
equity on the path of supplementing the doctrine of consideration by extending the common law notion of
estoppel, ‘equitable estoppel’ has been more prominent in the books than its common law original. The law is at
its worst when it refuses to name things in a straightforward way. It is impossible to understand or place
something that is obscurely named. For example, the reason why the tort in 
Rylands
 
v. 
Fletcher
 
is so puzzling is
that it is called just that, 
Rylands
 
v. 
Fletcher
. … ‘Estoppel’ is much the same. Out in the shops and restaurants of
the city, the word is never heard. Generations of law students have somehow let their teachers escape without
making them say how exactly the word works and what exactly it denotes. From the taxonomist’s point of view,
the consequence is that this entity is difficult to place. A huge case-law has developed, and all the time we have
never, in a sense, known what we were talking about.
The word ‘stop’ in the middle gives a clue. The French original means ‘bung’ or ‘stopper’. It was when it came
to bottling wines that estoppels had their natural home. The law makes liberal use of the metaphor of binding
and being bound. It is in ‘obligation’ and in ‘liable’, more obviously in ‘bond’. ‘Estoppel’ is another version of the
same metaphor. As a wine bottle is corked, so one is restricted or shut up. In short, one is bound. … we see that
estoppel names something obliquely, telling us that something binds. The thing or things we need to classify is
named by a consequence, the consequence being that, at least for some purposes, one is bound. In most
estoppels the thing in question is an undertaking, and in equitable estoppel, it is an undertaking as to the future
or, in short, a promise. Demystifying the word does not take us very far, but, subject to more refined argument,
it does allow the taxonomist committed to a classification of causative events to see what event he has to
classify.
Secondly, three different types of estoppel are referred to in the passage from Cooke.
The bank payment illustration is an example of estoppel by representation, the contract
interpretation hypothetical is an example of estoppel by convention and the illustration
involving the landlord is an example of equitable or promissory estoppel. As we shall
see, one of the most contested issues in this area of law is whether or not these different
estoppels can be unified into one coherent doctrine. The third point is that the definition
does not identify the cause of action that is at the root of an estoppel claim. It tells us
that estoppel is a ‘mechanism for enforcing consistency’ and the reference to the fact
that the party is ‘not contractually bound’ to stand by what he said or did suggests that it
is not part of the law of contract. But if it is not part of the law of contract, how do we
classify the claim? Is it part of the law of wrongs, the law of unjust enrichment, or is it
some type of claim that cannot be classified as a matter of law? We shall return to these
and other questions after examining two of the leading estoppel cases.
5.3.2
 
Two Leading Cases
The most commonly cited case in the development of estoppel in the twentieth century
is the decision of Denning J, as he then was, in 
Central London Property Trust Ltd
 
v.
High Trees House Ltd
 
[1947] 1 KB 130. In his judgment Denning J purported to find the
foundation for his approach in the judgment of the House of Lords in 
Hughes
 
v.
Metropolitan Railway Company
 
(1877) 2 App Cas 439. 
Hughes
 
was decided some 70
years before 
High Trees
 
but it 
had fallen into obscurity prior to its ‘rescue’ in 
High Trees
(see 
WJ Alan & Co Ltd
 
v. 
El Nasr Export & Import Co
 
[1972] 2 QB 189, 212). Given its
influence in the development of the law, it is important to start with 
Hughes
 
before
turning to 
High Trees
.
HUGHES V. METROPOLITAN RAILWAY COMPANY
(1877) 2 App Cas 439, House of Lords
The defendant company (the respondents) was the lessee of property owned by
the plaintiff (the appellant). On 22 October 1874 the plaintiff, acting pursuant to its
entitlement under the lease, served notice upon the defendants to repair the
property within six months. The lease was forfeitable by the plaintiff if the
defendants failed to comply with the notice. The defendants replied that the repairs
would be carried out but also suggested that the plaintiff might wish to buy the
defendants’ interest in the property and they therefore proposed to defer carrying
out the repairs until they heard from the plaintiff in relation to their offer to dispose
of their interest in the property. In November 1874 the plaintiff entered into
negotiations with the defendants for the surrender of the lease but made no
response to the defendants’ statement that they intended to defer carrying out the
repairs. The negotiations between the parties broke down on 31 December 1874.
There were no further communications between the parties until 19 April 1875,
when the defendants wrote to the plaintiff and stated that, in the light of the
breakdown in negotiations, ‘the company would take in hand the repairs’. The
notice issued by the plaintiff expired on 22 April 1875, and on 28 April the plaintiff
served a writ of ejectment on the defendants. The defendants completed the
repairs in June 1875. The House of Lords held that the defendants were entitled to
be relieved against the forfeiture of the lease. The plaintiff’s notice to repair the
property was in suspension for the duration of the negotiations between the parties
and did not revive until 31 December 1874. The repairs were carried out by the
defendants within six months of that date and they were entitled to relief against
forfeiture.
Lord Cairns LC
It was not argued at your Lordships’ Bar, and it could not be argued, that there was
any right of a Court of Equity, or any practice of a Court of Equity, to give relief in
cases of this kind, by way of mercy, or by way merely of saving property from
forfeiture, but it is the first principle upon which all Courts of Equity proceed, that if
parties who have entered into definite and distinct terms involving certain legal
results—certain penalties or legal forfeiture—afterwards by their own act or with
their own consent enter upon a course of negotiation which has the effect of
leading one of the parties to suppose that the strict rights arising under the contract
will not be enforced, or will be kept in suspense, or held in abeyance, the person
who otherwise might have enforced those rights will not be allowed to enforce
them where it would be inequitable having regard to the dealings which have thus
taken place between the parties. My Lords, I repeat that I attribute to the Appellant
no intention here to take advantage of, to lay a trap for, or to lull into false security
those with whom he was dealing; but it appears to me that both parties by entering
upon the negotiation which they entered upon, made it an inequitable thing that the
exact period of six months dating from the month of October should afterwards be
measured out as against the Respondents as the period during which the repairs
must be executed.

CENTRAL LONDON PROPERTY TRUST LTD V. HIGH
TREES HOUSE LTD
[1947] 1 KB 130, King’s Bench Division
In 1937 the plaintiff company granted a 99-year lease over a block of flats in
London to the defendant company, a subsidiary of the plaintiff, at an annual rent of
£2,500. Many people left London on the outbreak of the Second World War and,
as a consequence, the defendant was unable to let all the flats. Discussions took
place between the directors of the two companies and they resulted in an
agreement, made in January 1940, by which the plaintiff agreed to reduce the rent
‘as from the commencement of the lease to £1,250 per annum’. In March 1941 a
receiver was appointed to the plaintiff company. The defendant paid the reduced
rent from 1941 until the beginning of 1945 by which time the flats were fully
occupied. In September 1945 the receiver of the plaintiff company wrote to the
defendant and informed it that £2,500 was the agreed annual rent and he claimed
arrears of £7,916. The receiver then instituted ‘friendly proceedings’ to test the
legal position as between the two companies. The plaintiff claimed £625, being the
difference between £2,500 and £1,250 for the last two quarters of 1945. The
defendant denied that it was liable to pay the sums claimed. Denning J held that
the plaintiff was entitled to recover £625.
Denning J
[stated the facts and continued]
If I were to consider this matter without regard to recent developments in the
law, there is no doubt that had the plaintiffs claimed it, they would have been
entitled to recover ground rent at the rate of 2,500
l
. a year from the beginning of
the term, since the lease under which it was payable was a lease under seal
which, according to the old common law, could not be varied by an agreement by
parol (whether in writing or not), but only by deed. Equity, however stepped in, and
said that if there has been a variation of a deed by a simple contract (which in the
case of a lease required to be in writing would have to be evidenced by writing),
the courts may give effect to it as is shown in 
Berry
 
v. 
Berry
 
[1929] 2 KB 316. That
equitable doctrine, however, could hardly apply in the present case because the
variation here might be said to have been made without consideration. With regard
to estoppel, the representation made in relation to reducing the rent was not a
representation of an existing fact. It was a representation, in effect, as to the future,
namely, that payment of the rent would not be enforced at the full rate but only at
the reduced rate. Such a representation would not give rise to an estoppel,
because, as was said in 
Jorden
 
v. 
Money
 
(1854) 5 HLC 185, a representation as to
the future must be embodied as a contract or be nothing.
But what is the position in view of developments in the law in recent years? The
law has not been standing still since 
Jorden
 
v. 
Money
. There has been a series of
decisions over the last fifty years which, although they are said to be cases of
estoppel are not really such. They are cases in which a promise was made which
was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person
making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made
and which was in fact so acted on. In such cases the courts have said that the
promise must be honoured. … As I have said they are not cases of estoppel in the
strict sense. They are really promises—promises intended to be binding, intended
to be acted on, and in fact acted on. 
Jorden
 
v. 
Money
 
(1854) 5 HLC 185 can be
distinguished, because there the promisor made it clear that she did not intend to
be legally bound, whereas in the cases to which I refer the proper inference was
that the promisor did intend to be bound. In each case the court held the promise
to be binding on the party making 
it, even though under the old common law it
might be difficult to find any consideration for it. The courts have not gone so far as
to give a cause of action in damages for the breach of such a promise, but they
have refused to allow the party making it to act inconsistently with it. It is in that
sense, and that sense only, that such a promise gives rise to an estoppel. The
decisions are a natural result of the fusion of law and equity: for the cases of
Hughes
 
v. 
Metropolitan Ry Co
 
(1877) 2 App Cas 439, 448, 
Birmingham and District
Land Co
 
v. 
London & North Western Ry Co
 
(1888) 40 Ch D 268, 286 and 
Salisbury
(Marquess)
 
v. 
Gilmore
 
[1942] 2 KB 38, 51, afford a sufficient basis for saying that a
party would not be allowed in equity to go back on such a promise. In my opinion,
the time has now come for the validity of such a promise to be recognized. The
logical consequence, no doubt is that a promise to accept a smaller sum in
discharge of a larger sum, if acted upon, is binding notwithstanding the absence of
consideration: and if the fusion of law and equity leads to this result, so much the
better. That aspect was not considered in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
(1884) 9 App Cas 605. At
this time of day however, when law and equity have been joined together for over
seventy years, principles must be reconsidered in the light of their combined effect.
It is to be noticed that in the Sixth Interim Report of the Law Revision Committee,
paras. 35, 40, it is recommended that such a promise as that to which I have
referred, should be enforceable in law even though no consideration for it has
been given by the promisee. It seems to me that, to the extent I have mentioned
that result has now been achieved by the decisions of the courts.
I am satisfied that a promise such as that to which I have referred is binding
and the only question remaining for my consideration is the scope of the promise
in the present case. I am satisfied on all the evidence that the promise here was
that the ground rent should be reduced to 1,250l. a year as a temporary expedient
while the block of flats was not fully, or substantially fully let, owing to the
conditions prevailing. That means that the reduction in the rent applied throughout
the years down to the end of 1944, but early in 1945 it is plain that the flats were
fully let, and, indeed the rents received from them (many of them not being
affected by the Rent Restrictions Acts), were increased beyond the figure at which
it was originally contemplated that they would be let. At all events the rent from
them must have been very considerable. I find that the conditions prevailing at the
time when the reduction in rent was made, had completely passed away by the
early months of 1945. I am satisfied that the promise was understood by all parties
only to apply under the conditions prevailing at the time when it was made, namely,
when the flats were only partially let, and that it did not extend any further than
that. When the flats became fully let, early in 1945, the reduction ceased to apply.
In those circumstances, under the law as I hold it, it seems to me that rent is
payable at the full rate for the quarters ending September 29 and December 25,
1945.
If the case had been one of estoppel, it might be said that in any event the
estoppel would cease when the conditions to which the representation applied
came to an end, or it also might be said that it would only come to an end on
notice. In either case it is only a way of ascertaining what is the scope of the
representation. I prefer to apply the principle that a promise intended to be binding,
intended to be acted on and in fact acted on, is binding so far as its terms properly
apply. Here it was binding as covering the period down to the early part of 1945,
and as from that time full rent is payable.
I therefore give judgment for the plaintiff company for the amount claimed.
Commentary
Professor Treitel has stated (
Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract Law
(Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 29) that ‘the 
High Trees
 
case is surely one of the
most prominent of the landmarks in twentieth century contract law’. He notes that its
exalted status is, in many 
ways, remarkable given that it was apparently argued and
decided in one day. The judgment of Denning J was therefore, in all probability, an
unreserved judgment. As Professor Treitel has remarked, ‘if there was any time for
reflection, it could at most have been the luncheon recess’. The facts of the case are
rather unusual in that the litigation was conducted between members of the same
corporate group and it is not altogether clear why the claim was brought in the first
place. The claim may not in fact have been a ‘friendly’ one but a keenly fought contest
between the defendant and the creditors of the plaintiff company.
High Trees
 
is a notable decision for a number of reasons. First it would appear from the
first paragraph of the judgment that 
High Trees
 
might not be an estoppel case at all. In
this part of his judgment Denning J is attempting to get round the decision of the House
of Lords in 
Jorden
 
v. 
Money
 
(1854) 5 HLC 185 in which it was held that an estoppel
must relate to a statement of fact and that it could not apply to a case where, in the
words of Lord Cranworth LC (at pp. 214–215), ‘the representation is not a
representation of fact, but a statement of something which the party intends or does not
intend to do’. The statement in issue in 
High Trees
 
was clearly a statement of intent, or a
promise, and so was vulnerable to the argument that effect could not be given to it
consistently with 
Jorden
 
v. 
Money
. Denning J attempts to deal with this difficulty in the
second paragraph of his judgment where he draws on cases in equity, including 
Hughes
v. 
Metropolitan Railway
, which he states are ‘not cases of estoppel in the strict sense’.
Rather, he states that they are cases of ‘promises intended to be binding, intended to be
acted on, and in fact acted on’ and he then distinguishes 
Jorden
 
on the rather dubious
ground that the promisor there did not intend to be legally bound by the promise made.
Secondly, it is important to note that the reasoning of Denning J in this second
paragraph brings him into an apparent conflict with 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
in that he recognizes
that the ‘logical consequence’ of the principle that he articulates is that ‘a promise to
accept a smaller sum in discharge of a larger sum, if acted upon, is binding
notwithstanding the absence of consideration’. He then adds the rather curious sentence
that this aspect ‘was not considered in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
’. Professor Treitel points out
(
Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract Law
 
(2002), p. 32) that this sentence
is only to be found in the official report of the case; it is not to be found in the other four
reports of the case. It is therefore possible that it was inserted as an afterthought by
Denning J when the draft judgment was submitted by the editor of the Law Reports for
his approval. But what is to be made of his suggestion that the House of Lords in 
Foakes
did not consider this aspect of the case? Professor Treitel responds to this suggestion in
the following way (
Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract Law
 
(2002), p.
32):
It is hard to suppose that the House of Lords in 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
can have been unaware of 
Hughes
 
v.
Metropolitan Railway
 
which had been decided only seven years previously, particularly as two members of the
House of Lords who had decided the 
Hughes
 
case [Lords Selborne and Blackburn] also heard the appeal in
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
. The most plausible explanation of the fact that ‘That aspect was not considered in 
Foakes
 
v.
Beer
’ seems to be that it was not thought to be relevant since 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
 
was concerned with the argument
that legal rights had been 
permanently
 
extinguished while the 
Hughes
 
principle was concerned with their
temporary suspension.
It can be argued that the principles that underpin 
Hughes
 
and 
Foakes
 
are very different
in nature. Professor Brownsword (
Smith and Thomas: A Casebook on Contract
 
(14th
edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021), para 11-004) sets out the principle that was applied in
Hughes
 
in the following terms:
If A tells B (by words or conduct) that B need not perform a contractual (or other) obligation owed by B to A and
B takes A at his word and does not perform that obligation, A cannot treat that non-performance as a breach of
contract entitling him to damages or to terminate the contract. It would be entirely wrong that A should be
allowed to treat as a legal wrong that to which he has consented.
On the other hand, he formulates the principle in 
Foakes
 
as follows:
If A tells B that B need not perform a contractual (or other) obligation owed by B to A, A can change his mind
and require B to perform that obligation in so far as it is still possible to do so. A is not alleging that B has
broken his contract—he is simply saying ‘Now you must perform—and if you fail to do so, that will be a breach
of contract’.
The third point to note is that the result of the case was that the plaintiff was entitled to
demand the full rent of £2,500 from the time at which the flats became fully let in early
1945. In this sense the effect of the estoppel (albeit that it may not have been an estoppel
in the strict sense) was not to deprive the plaintiff of its right to demand the full rent.
Rather the right was in suspension for the wartime period when the flats were only
partially let. But it is important to note that there is a sense in which the estoppel had
extinctive effect. Denning J was careful to state that ‘the reduction in rent applied
throughout the years down to the end of 1944’ and it would therefore seem to follow
that, had the plaintiff demanded that the defendants pay the rent in full for the duration
of the war years, the claim would have failed. As a result of its promise the plaintiff’s
right to demand the full rent from 1940 to 1945 was not in suspension. It was lost.
5.3.3
 
The Ingredients of Promissory Estoppel
Notwithstanding the statement of Denning J that 
High Trees
 
is not a case of estoppel in
the ‘strict sense’, it has subsequently been regarded as a landmark case in the
development of what has come to be known as ‘equitable’ or ‘promissory’ estoppel. The
transition to the language of promissory estoppel can be seen in the following passage
from the judgment of Lord Hodson in 
Ajayi
 
v. 
R T Briscoe (Nigeria) Ltd
 
[1964] 1 WLR
1326, 1330:
The principle, which has been described as quasi estoppel and perhaps more aptly as promissory estoppel, is
that when one party to a contract in the absence of fresh consideration agrees not to enforce his rights, an equity
will be raised in favour of the other party. This equity is, however, subject to the qualifications (i) that the other
party has altered his position, (ii) that the promisor can resile from his promise on giving reasonable notice,
which need not be formal notice, giving the promisee a reasonable opportunity of resuming his position, (iii) the
promise only becomes final and irrevocable if the promisee cannot resume his position.
As a definition of the scope of estoppel this statement cannot be said to be exhaustive. It
does not identify all the ingredients of promissory estoppel. In particular, it does not
include the requirement that the promise must be ‘clear and unequivocal’ nor does it
provide any clear 
definition of the remedy available (other than the broad reference to
an ‘equity’). A fuller account of the elements of promissory estoppel can be provided as
follows:
5.3.3.1
 
Clear and Unequivocal Promise
The promise that gives rise to the estoppel must be a clear and unequivocal promise.
The promise must have been one that was intended to affect the legal relations between
the parties and that clearly demonstrated that the promisor was giving up his strict legal
rights (or some of them) against the promisee. In 
Woodhouse AC Israel Cocoa SA
 
v.
Nigerian Produce Marketing Co Ltd
 
[1972] AC 741, 757 Lord Hailsham of St
Marylebone LC stated:
Counsel for the appellants was asked whether he knew of any case in which an ambiguous statement had ever
formed the basis of a purely promissory estoppel. … He candidly replied that he did not. I do not find this
surprising, since it would really be an astonishing thing if, in the case of a genuine misunderstanding as to the
meaning of an offer, the offeree could obtain by means of the doctrine of promissory estoppel something that he
must fail to obtain under the conventional law of contract.
Notwithstanding its absence from Lord Hodson’s description in 
Ajayi
, this element is a
necessary one for the protection of promisors. Promisors should not be required to
insist upon their legal rights in order to protect them, and the law does not demand that
they do so. Rather the law provides that they will only lose their contractual rights when
they clearly and unequivocally promise that they will give them up (either in whole or in
part).
5.3.3.2
 
The Promisee Has Altered His Position
The promisor must have altered his position in reliance upon the promise that has been
made. In many cases the promisee will alter his position to his detriment. This was the
case in 
Hughes
 
v. 
Metropolitan Railway
 
(
5.3.2
) where, as a result of the negotiations
with the landlord, the tenants lost the time they otherwise would have had to carry out
the repairs. But detrimental reliance is not apparent in all cases. For example, there was
no obvious detriment to the tenants in 
High Trees
 
(
5.3.2
) because they were only being
asked to pay the rent that they had contracted to pay. Thus it would appear from 
High
Trees
 
that the promisee need not have acted to his detriment provided that he has
altered his position to the extent that it would be inequitable to allow the promisor to go
back on the promise made. In 
Société Italo-Belge pour le Commerce et l’Industrie
 
v.
Palm and Vegetable Oils (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (The Post Chaser)
 
[1982] 1 All ER 19, 26–
27 Robert Goff J stated:
I approach the matter as follows. The fundamental principle is that stated by Lord Cairns [in 
Hughes
 
v.
Metropolitan Railway
], viz. that the representor will not be allowed to enforce his rights ‘where it would be
inequitable having regard to the dealings which have thus taken place between the parties’. To establish such
inequity, it is not necessary to show detriment; indeed, the representee may have benefited from the
representation, and yet it may be inequitable, at least without reasonable notice, for the representor to enforce
his legal rights. Take the facts of 
Central London Property Trust Ltd
 
v. 
High Trees House Ltd
 
[1947] 1 KB 130,
the case in which Denning J breathed new life into the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The 
representation was by
a lessor to the effect that he would be content to accept a reduced rent. In such a case, although the lessee has
benefited from the reduction in rent, it may well be inequitable for the lessor to insist upon his legal right to the
unpaid rent, because the lessee has conducted his affairs on the basis that he would only have to pay rent at the
lower rate; and a court might well think it right to conclude that only after reasonable notice could the lessor
return to charging rent at the higher rate specified in the lease. Furthermore it would be open to the Court, in
any particular case, to infer from the circumstances of the case that the representee must have conducted his
affairs in such a way that it would be inequitable for the representor to enforce his rights, or to do so without
reasonable notice. But it does not follow that in every case in which the representee has acted, or failed to act, in
reliance on the representation, it will be inequitable for the representor to enforce his rights for the nature of
the action, or inaction may be insufficient to give rise to the equity, in which event a necessary requirement
stated by Lord Cairns LC for the application of the doctrine would not have been fulfilled.
5.3.3.3
 
Inequitable for the Promisor to Go Back on His
Promise
The requirement that it must be inequitable for the promisor to go back on his promise
overlaps to some extent with the requirement that the promisee must have altered his
position, as can be seen from the extract from the judgment of Robert Goff J in 
The Post
Chaser
. The significance of the requirement that it must be inequitable for the promisor
to go back on his promise can be seen in 
D & C Builders
 
v. 
Rees
 
(
5.2.2.4.1
) where the
Court of Appeal concluded that it was not inequitable for the creditor to go back on his
promise to accept part payment in discharge of the entire debt.
5.3.3.4
 
Suspension
The effect of an estoppel is generally suspensory (see 
Tool Metal Manufacturing Co Ltd
v. 
Tungsten Electric Co Ltd
 
[1955] 1 WLR 761). Thus in 
Hughes
 
v. 
Metropolitan
Railway
 
(
5.3.2
) the landlord did not lose his right to require that the repairs be carried
out within six months. It was simply the case that this right was in suspense during the
currency of the negotiations between the landlord and the tenants. On the breakdown of
the negotiations the landlord could have revived his right by giving notice to the tenants
requiring them to effect the repairs within a six-month period. The suspensory nature of
estoppel is underlined by Lord Hodson in his second ‘qualification’ in 
Ajayi
 
(quoted
earlier). On the other hand, Lord Hodson’s third qualification clearly suggests that an
estoppel can, in certain circumstances, be ‘final and irrevocable’. When can an estoppel
have extinctive effect? Some guidance can be obtained on this point from 
High Trees
(
5.3.2
), where Denning J held that the plaintiff landlord could revive its right to demand
the full rent for the future but that it could not go back and demand the unpaid rent
during the war when the flats were only partially let. Thus estoppel is generally
suspensory in relation to obligations to be performed in the future (in the sense that the
obligation can be revived by the giving of reasonable notice) but it may be extinctive in
relation to events that have occurred in the past (so that the promisor cannot go back
and retrospectively demand that the promisee perform his obligations in the past or
maintain that the promisee was in breach of contract as a result of his failure to perform
his contractual obligations to the full when the reason for the promisee’s failure to
perform 
was his reliance upon the promisor’s promise that he need not perform in
accordance with the strict letter of the contract).
5.3.3.5
 
Estoppel Cannot Act as a Cause of Action
Combe
 
v. 
Combe
 
illustrates the final point in relation to the requirements of promissory
estoppel, namely that it cannot create a cause of action. This principle is often expressed
in the maxim that ‘estoppel can be used as a shield but not as a sword’, but the
sword/shield metaphor must be handled with some care. While it is true that
promissory estoppel often operates, as in 
Hughes
 
v. 
Metropolitan Railway
 
and 
High
Trees
, as a defence to a claim, the proposition that estoppel cannot create a cause of
action requires some refinement, as the following extract demonstrates.
R HALSON, ‘THE OFFENSIVE LIMITS OF PROMISSORY
ESTOPPEL’
[1999] 
LMCLQ
 
257, 259–261
A.
 
The estoppel spectrum described
(1)
 
Estoppel can only be used as a defence
This is the least ambitious claim that can be made. New legal doctrines often make
their first appearance in a truncated and non-threatening guise. Therefore it should
occasion no surprise that in both of the seminal cases, 
Hughes
 
v. 
Metropolitan Ry
and 
Central London Property Trust Co Ltd
 
v. 
High Trees House
, estoppel was
relied upon as a defence …
(2)
 
Estoppel can be used by a party seeking to enforce a claim
based upon a recognized cause of action to defeat the defence or
counter-claim of the other party
A simple example of this use of promissory estoppel would be provided by a
variation of the facts of 
High Trees
: the lessor lets directly to an occupying tenant;
some time after the representation has been made and reduced rent payments
have been accepted, the landlord distrains the tenant’s property in order to recover
the balance of the rent. Here the tenant could bring an action for conversion; the
landlord would reply that he was rightfully distraining, and the tenant could use
estoppel to defeat this defence. Academic authority also supports this usage.
(3)
 
Estoppel can be used by a party seeking to enforce a claim to
prove one element of a recognized cause of action
This appears to be the effect the promissory estoppel was stated to have in
Robertson
 
v. 
Ministry of Pensions
, where the plaintiff was relieved of the burden of
having to prove that his injury was attributable to war service in order to qualify for
a disablement pension because the Ministry were estopped from denying this
causal connection. The plaintiff’s cause of action was a recognized one; in this
case statutory or at least 
sui generis
. Yet it could not be said that the estoppel
relieved the colonel of the obligation to prove all the elements of his cause of
action, e.g., that he had served long enough and in a sufficient capacity to qualify
for a pension, that the injury was serious enough to so qualify etc. The estoppel
related solely to the question of causation; was the injury attributable to military
service. This usage may have been what Denning LJ was thinking of when, in
Combe
 
v. 
Combe
, commenting upon a number of decisions including the
Robertson
 
case, he said:
‘In none of these cases was the defendant sued on the promise, assurance or assertion as a cause of
action in itself; he was sued for some other cause, for example a pension … and the promise, assurance
or assertion only played a supplementary role—an important role, no doubt, but still a supplementary
role.’
(4)
 
Estoppel can be used by a party seeking to enforce a claim to
prove all the elements of a recognized cause of action
This appears to be the way the promissory estoppel was used in 
The Henrik Sif
.
The first defendants conducted themselves as if they were a party to a bill of
lading, which they were not. This led the plaintiff to allow the limitation period to run
out against the second defendant, who was a party to the bill of lading. The judge
based his finding for the plaintiff in his action against the first defendants, 
inter alia
,
upon promissory estoppel. It appears that all the elements (agreement,
consideration etc) of a recognized cause of action (contract) were proved by the
estoppel …
(5)
 
Estoppel has created a new cause of action
This was the effect of the first instance decision in 
Combe
 
v. 
Combe
. The judge
appeared to have dispensed with the need for consideration in order to enforce a
promise, as opposed to giving more limited effect to the promise which the
common law and equitable doctrines of waiver and promissory estoppel would
allow
. This would create a new cause of action and abrogate the requirement of
consideration. The Court of Appeal strongly disclaimed this view, Denning LJ
saying of promissory estoppel: ‘the principle never stands alone as giving a cause
of action in itself’.
The first and second points on Professor Halson’s spectrum are not controversial, but
the same cannot be said of the other three points (see further M Barnes, ‘Estoppels as
Swords’ [2011] 
LMCLQ
 
372). The final point on the spectrum, that promissory estoppel
cannot itself create a cause of action, is well established in the authorities (most notably
in 
Combe
 
v. 
Combe
) but can be said to be controversial for two reasons. The first relates
to the justification for the rule: why is it that promissory estoppel cannot create a cause
of action? The answer given in 
Combe
 
is that to do so would undermine the doctrine of
consideration. This claim was, however, rejected by the High Court of Australia in
Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd
 
v. 
Maher
 
(1987) 164 CLR 387 (see later, 
5.3.5
), where it
was recognized that promissory estoppel could, in an appropriate case, create a cause of
action. The second is that the rule does not apply to all estoppels. Proprietary estoppel
can create a cause of action (see later, 
5.3.5
) but other estoppels cannot (
Riverside
Housing Association
 
v. 
White
 
[2005] EWCA Civ 1385, [2006] HLR 15 and 
Newport
City Council
 
v. 
Charles
 
[2008] EWCA Civ 1541, [2009] 1 WLR 1884). Why is it that only
proprietary estoppel can create a cause of action? The answer to this question is far from
obvious. There are also difficulties in relation to Professor Halson’s third and fourth
points on the spectrum. The first is: why is it that promissory estoppel can provide part
of a cause of action, or support a cause of action, when it cannot supply the entire cause
of action? The second is whether these propositions are correct as a matter of law, given
that some courts seem to interpret the maxim that estoppel cannot be used as a sword to
encompass points three and four on Professor Halson’s spectrum (see, for example,
Riverside Housing Association
 
v. 
White
).
5.3.4
 
The Different Types of Estoppel
The proposition that estoppel cannot create a new cause of action is not, however,
universally true in English law. Proprietary estoppel, as we shall see, can create a cause
of action. But promissory estoppel cannot (at least at present). This raises the question
why it is that English law has different rules for different types of estoppel. This is not
the place to embark upon a discussion of the various types of estoppel that exist. The
topic is a terminological minefield (especially in relation to words such as ‘waiver’ and
‘forbearance’). For our purposes it suffices to draw attention to the doctrine of waiver
and three different types of estoppel.
The word ‘waiver’ is a difficult one in English law. The cause of the difficulty is that the
word has been used in many different situations. Essentially, waiver covers the situation
where one party promises to give up some or all of his contractual rights. A waiver that
is supported by consideration takes effect as a variation but the type of waiver in which
we are interested is a waiver of rights that is not supported by consideration (often
referred to as forbearance). This is a topic of some difficulty and the terminology is
particularly confusing. While waiver, in the sense of forbearance, enjoys an ancient
history, it may be that today it should be seen as a species of estoppel which should be
amalgamated within the 
High Trees
 
line of authority. In 
Charles Rickards Ltd
 
v.
Oppenheim
 
[1950] 1 KB 616, 623, when considering whether or not a buyer had waived
a term in the contract relating to the time of delivery, Denning LJ stated:
Whether it be called waiver or forbearance on his part, or an agreed variation or substituted performance, does
not matter. It is a kind of estoppel. By his conduct he made a promise not to insist on his strict legal rights. That
promise was intended to be binding, intended to be acted on, and was, in fact, acted on. … It is a particular
application of the principle which I endeavoured to state in 
Central London Property Trust Ltd
 
v. 
High Trees
House Ltd
.
Turning now to the estoppels, the first is estoppel by representation. It can be
distinguished from promissory estoppel on the ground that estoppel by representation is
confined to statements of fact and does not extend to promises. Thus a party who makes
a representation of existing fact which induces the other party to act to his detriment in
reliance upon the representation may not be permitted subsequently to act
inconsistently with that representation. Estoppel by representation is a rule of evidence
that has the effect of permanently preventing a representor from asserting or proving
facts that are contrary to his own representation.
The second type of estoppel is estoppel by convention. In 
Amalgamated Investment &
Property Co Ltd
 
v. 
Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd
 
[1982] QB 84, 130–131
Brandon LJ adopted the following definition of estoppel by convention, taken from the
third edition of 
Spencer Bower and Turner, Estoppel by Representation
 
(Butterworths,
1977), p. 157:
This form of estoppel is founded, not on a representation of fact made by a representor and believed by a
representee, but on an agreed statement of facts the truth of which has been assumed, by the convention of the
parties, as the basis of a transaction into which they are about to enter. When the parties have acted in their
transaction upon the agreed assumption that a given state of facts is to be accepted between them as true, then
as regards that transaction each will be estopped as against the other from questioning the truth of the
statement of facts so assumed.
Estoppel by convention is most commonly invoked in the context of the interpretation of
documents (see 
ING Bank NV
 
v. 
Ros Roca SA
 
[2011] EWCA Civ 353, [2012] 1 WLR
472). For example, in 
Amalgamated Investment
 
the defendant bank provided a loan to
a subsidiary company of the plaintiff company, and the plaintiff provided the defendants
with a guarantee which stated:
The guarantor will pay to you on demand all moneys which now are or shall at any times hereafter be due or
owing or payable to you on any account whatsoever by the principal.
For exchange control purposes the money was advanced not by the defendant bank but
by one of the defendant’s subsidiaries. The plaintiff claimed that its liability was to the
subsidiary and not to the bank so that it could not be liable under the guarantee. The
Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was liable to the defendant both as a matter of
interpretation of the guarantee (on the basis that the guarantee was not to be
interpreted on its own but in the context of the negotiations between the parties) and, in
the alternative, on the ground that the plaintiff was estopped by convention from
denying that it was bound to discharge the indebtedness of its own subsidiary company
to the subsidiary of the defendant that had advanced the money. The parties had entered
into the transaction on the assumption that the plaintiff was so liable and the parties
had acted on that assumption when giving effect to the transaction and the effect of the
estoppel was to hold them to the validity of that assumption.
The third type of estoppel is proprietary estoppel. In 
Thorner
 
v. 
Major
 
[2009] UKHL 18,
[2009] 1 WLR 776 Lord Walker identified the three principal ingredients of proprietary
estoppel, namely (i) a representation or assurance made to the claimant relating to the
acquisition by the claimant of an interest in property, typically an interest in land; (ii)
reliance on that representation or assurance by the claimant; and (iii) detriment to the
claimant in consequence of his (reasonable) reliance on that representation or assurance
(the latter two ingredients are not infrequently intertwined: 
Henry
 
v. 
Henry
 
[2010]
UKPC 3, [2010] 1 All ER 988, [55]). Cases of proprietary estoppel can be divided into
two broad categories. The first consists of cases in which a landowner stands by while
another person improves his land in the mistaken belief that he, the improver, is the
owner of the land. The second comprises cases in which the promisee relies to his
detriment upon the landowner’s promise that he has or will be given an interest in the
land. While cases of proprietary estoppel appear to defy exhaustive categorization, and
cases can be found in which the doctrine has been described in broad, discretionary
terms, modern authority (such as 
Yeoman’s Row Management Ltd
 
v. 
Cobbe
 
[2008]
UKHL 55, [2008] 1 WLR 1752 and 
Thorner
 
v. 
Major
 
[2009] UKHL 18, [2009] 1 WLR
776) support a more principled basis for the doctrine. In particular, it is not sufficient to
establish a case of proprietary estoppel to allege and prove that the defendant was guilty
of ‘unconscionable conduct’ (see 
Yeoman’s Row Management Ltd
 
v. 
Cobbe
).
Proprietary estoppel must therefore be kept within proper bounds and so the courts can
be expected to insist on compliance with the tripartite test set out by Lord Walker in
Major
 
and they have stated their reluctance to allow proprietary estoppel to introduce
uncertainty into commercial transactions (see 
Yeoman’s Row Management Ltd
 
v.
Cobbe
).
5.3.5
 
Unifying the Estoppels
At the moment it cannot be said that we have a common set of rules that govern the
various different types of estoppel. A number of differences exist. First, in the case of
promissory estoppel there must be a clear and unequivocal promise or representation,
whereas in the case 
of proprietary estoppel the understanding between the parties can
be much more imprecise (see, for example, 
Thorner
 
v. 
Major
 
[2009] UKHL 18, [2009] 1
WLR 776). Secondly, estoppel by representation only applies to statements of fact and
cannot apply to representations as to the future, whereas promissory estoppel applies to
promises or statements that relate to the future. Estoppel by representation is also
permanent in its effects, while promissory estoppel is generally suspensory in effect.
Thirdly, there is a need for detrimental reliance in some types of estoppel but not
necessarily in others. In the case of estoppel by representation it seems clear that there
must be detrimental reliance but in other cases, such as promissory estoppel, there must
be reliance but that reliance need not be detrimental. Fourthly, proprietary estoppel can
create a cause of action while promissory estoppel presently cannot (
Tinkler
 
v.
Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
 
[2021] UKSC 39, [2021] 3
WLR 697, [75]).
One of the issues that surfaces from time to time in both the case-law and the academic
literature is whether or not English law should seek to develop a general principle which
is capable of unifying the various estoppels. Cases can be found in which judges have
stated that the distinctions drawn between the different types of estoppel are unhelpful
(so, for example, in 
Crabb
 
v. 
Arun District Council
 
[1976] Ch 179, 193, Scarman LJ
stated that he did ‘not find helpful the distinction between promissory and proprietary
estoppel’ in relation to the issue that was before the court). Other judges have sought to
formulate a broad, overarching principle to govern estoppels (see, for example,
Amalgamated Investment & Property Co Ltd
 
v. 
Texas Commerce International Bank
Ltd
 
[1982] QB 84, 122, per Lord Denning, and 
Taylors Fashions Ltd
 
v. 
Liverpool
Victoria Trustees Ltd
 
[1982] QB 133, 151–152, per Oliver J (‘whether in particular
individual circumstances it would be unconscionable for a party to be permitted to deny
that which, knowingly or unknowingly, he has allowed or encouraged another to assume
to his detriment’)).
The general judicial response to attempts to unify the estoppels has not, however, been
positive (
Tinkler
 
v. 
Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
 
[2021]
UKSC 39, [2021] 3 WLR 697, [28]). Various objections have been put forward. First,
some of the differences are established as a matter of authority (for example, the rule
that promissory estoppel cannot create a cause of action) and cannot lightly be set aside.
Secondly, if we are to unify the rules which rules should prevail? Should it be the rules of
estoppel by representation, promissory estoppel, or proprietary estoppel? The
proposition that estoppel by representation should provide the basis for the unification
of the law was rejected by Millett LJ in 
First National Bank
 
v. 
Thompson
 
[1996] Ch 231,
236 in the following terms:
Spencer Bower’s valiant attempt in 
The Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation
 
(1923) to demonstrate that
all estoppels other than estoppel by record are now subsumed in the single and all-embracing estoppel by
representation and that they are all governed by the same requirements has never won general acceptance.
Historically unsound, it has been repudiated by academic writers and is unsupported by authority.
Promissory estoppel may be a more suitable candidate as the basis for the articulation of
a general principle but would we want to expand the rule that promissory estoppel
cannot create a new cause of action to cases of proprietary estoppel? As Professor Treitel
points out (
Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract Law
 
(Oxford University
Press, 2002), p. 40) the view that the various estoppels may merge into one general
principle ‘may encourage cross-fertilization between them, but it can equally encourage
cross-infection 
and even cross-sterilization’. Thirdly, any general principle would have
to be stated at a very high level of abstraction and so may give rise to considerable
uncertainty. We may want to recognize that at least some of the estoppels are related to
one another but it does not follow from this that we should attempt to formulate a
general principle that can unite them all. As Lord Goff stated in 
Johnson
 
v. 
Gore Wood
& Co (A Firm)
 
[2001] 1 All ER 481, 508:
In the end, I am inclined to think that the many circumstances capable of giving rise to an estoppel cannot be
accommodated within a single formula, and that it is unconscionability which provides the link between them.
Fourthly, there may be good reasons for the differences between (at least some of) the
different types of estoppel. In 
Republic of India
 
v. 
Indian Steamship Co Ltd (No 2)
[1998] AC 878, 914 Lord Steyn stated:
The question was debated whether estoppel by convention and estoppel by acquiescence are but aspects of one
overarching principle. I do not underestimate the importance in the continuing development of the law of the
search for simplicity. I, also, accept that at a high level of abstraction such an overarching principle could be
formulated. But … to restate the law in terms of an overarching principle might tend to blur the necessarily
separate requirements and distinct terrain of application, of the two kinds of estoppel.
In 
Baird Textile Holdings Ltd
 
v. 
Marks and Spencer plc
 
[2001] EWCA Civ 274, [2002] 1
All ER (Comm) 737, Mance LJ stated (at [83] and [84]):
Speaking generally, I accept that estoppel is a flexible doctrine, that broad equitable principles underlie its
application in different fields (the concept of unconscionability being one such general principle) and that one
should avoid ‘rigid classification of equitable estoppel into exclusive and defined categories’. … However, not
only are we bound in this court by previous authority on the scope of particular types of estoppel, but it seems to
me inherent in the doctrine’s very flexibility that it may take different shapes to fit the context of different fields.
Given these statements, the way ahead might be to seek to rationalize the principles
underpinning the estoppels whenever it is possible to do so with a view to eliminating
any unnecessary differences that exist between the different estoppels. This will not be
an easy task. It will require us to justify some of the differences that currently exist
between the different estoppels. Why, for example, can proprietary estoppel create a
new cause of action when promissory estoppel cannot? What is so special about
promises that relate to the creation of an interest in land that demands that they be
given special treatment? As Brennan J observed in the leading Australian case of
Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd
 
v. 
Maher
 
(1987) 164 CLR 387:
If it be unconscionable for an owner of property in certain circumstances to fail to fulfil a non-contractual
promise that he will convey an interest in the property to another, is there any reason in principle why it is not
unconscionable in similar circumstances for a person to fail to fulfil a non-contractual promise that he will
confer a non-proprietary legal right on another? It does not accord with principle to hold that equity, in seeking
to avoid detriment occasioned by unconscionable conduct, can give relief in some cases but not in others.
In 
Waltons Stores
 
itself the High Court of Australia took the step of recognizing that
promissory estoppel can, in an appropriate case, create a cause of action. In so
concluding, it rejected the objection that such a step had the effect of undermining the
doctrine of consideration. Thus Brennan J stated:
The unconscionable conduct which it is the object of equity to prevent is the failure of a party, who has induced
the adoption of the assumption or expectation and who knew or intended that it would be relied on, to fulfil the
assumption or expectation or otherwise to avoid the detriment which that failure would occasion. The object of
the equity is not to compel the party bound to fulfil the assumption or expectation; it is to avoid the detriment
which, if the assumption or expectation goes unfulfilled, will be suffered by the party who has been induced to
act or to abstain from acting thereon.
If this object is kept steadily in mind, the concern that a general application of the principle of equitable
estoppel would make non-contractual promises enforceable as contractual promises can be allayed. A non-
contractual promise can give rise to an equitable estoppel only when the promisor induces the promisee to
assume or expect that the promise is intended to affect their legal relations and he knows or intends that the
promisee will act or abstain from acting in reliance on the promise, and when the promisee does so act or
abstain from acting and the promisee would suffer detriment by his action or inaction if the promisor were not
to fulfil the promise. When these elements are present, equitable estoppel almost wears the appearance of
contract, for the action or inaction of the promisee looks like consideration for the promise on which, as the
promisor knew or intended, the promisee would act or abstain from acting …
But there are differences between a contract and an equity created by estoppel. A contractual obligation is
created by the agreement of the parties; an equity created by estoppel may be imposed irrespective of any
agreement by the party bound. A contractual obligation must be supported by consideration; an equity created
by estoppel need not be supported by what is, strictly speaking, consideration. The measure of a contractual
obligation depends on the terms of the contract and the circumstances to which it applies; the measure of an
equity created by estoppel varies according to what is necessary to prevent detriment resulting from
unconscionable conduct.
The facts of 
Waltons Stores
 
provide a helpful illustration of a circumstance in which it
may be appropriate to conclude that an estoppel can create a cause of action. Waltons
Stores (Interstate) Ltd entered into negotiations in September 1983 with Mr and Mrs
Maher for the lease by Waltons of the Mahers’ property. The Mahers proposed to
demolish the buildings on their land and erect a new building built to Waltons’
specifications. Solicitors acting for Waltons sent a form of lease to the Mahers’ solicitors.
On 1 November the Mahers’ solicitor informed Waltons’ solicitor that the Mahers had
begun to demolish the old building on the site. On 7 November he further informed
them that it was essential that the agreement be concluded within a day or so if the work
was to progress and that the Mahers did not want to demolish the ‘new brick part of the
old building’ until it was clear that there would be no problems with the lease. Waltons’
solicitor replied to the effect that he had received verbal instructions that the
amendments made to the lease were acceptable to his clients but that he would obtain
formal instructions from them and inform him if there were any problems. No problems
were reported to the Mahers’ solicitor. On 11 November the Mahers’ solicitor sent to
Waltons’ solicitor ‘by way of exchange’ the lease which had been executed by the
Mahers. 
The Mahers then began the demolition of the new part of the old building. On
21 November Waltons began to have second thoughts about the project and they
instructed their solicitors to ‘go slow’. On 10 December Waltons became aware of the
fact that the Mahers had begun the demolition work. In early January the Mahers
started to build on the land in accordance with Waltons’ specifications until they were
told on 21 January that Waltons did not intend to proceed with the lease, by which time
40 per cent of the works were complete. In these circumstances the High Court held
that, although no formal contract had been concluded between the parties, Waltons
were estopped from denying that they were bound by such an agreement and that
Waltons were therefore liable in damages to the Mahers.
A number of points should be noted about 
Waltons Stores
. The first is that the estoppel
clearly operated to confer a cause of action upon the Mahers. The second is that the
judges were careful to state that not every act of reliance upon a gratuitous promise will
bring promissory estoppel into play. Thus Mason CJ and Wilson J stated in their
judgment:
[A]s failure to fulfil a promise does not of itself amount to unconscionable conduct, mere reliance on an
executory promise to do something, resulting in the promisee changing his position or suffering detriment, does
not bring promissory estoppel into play. Something more is required.
The exact nature of that ‘something more’ will doubtless depend upon the facts of the
case but there must be something which renders it ‘unconscionable’ for the promisor to
go back on his promise. Thirdly, it is not clear how 
Waltons Stores
 
would be decided by
an English court. It would probably not fall within the scope of proprietary estoppel
because the work was done on the Mahers’ land and not Waltons’ land and, in relation
to promissory estoppel, it would run into the obstacle that promissory estoppel cannot
create a cause of action. On the other hand, in 
Baird Textile Holdings Ltd
 
v. 
Marks and
Spencer plc
 
[2001] EWCA Civ 274, [2002] 1 All ER (Comm) 737, Mance LJ stated (at
[98]):
There was in 
Waltons Stores
 
complete agreement on the terms of the lease. The agreement was merely
unenforceable for want of compliance with the statute. It may be arguable that recognition of an estoppel here
would not be to use estoppel ‘as giving a cause of action in itself’, and it would certainly not be to undermine the
necessity of consideration. Rather, it would preclude the potential lessee from raising a collateral objection to
the binding nature of the agreed lease.
Such an approach would enable the English courts to reach the same result as that
reached in 
Waltons Stores
 
without taking on board the broader jurisdiction asserted by
the High Court of Australia. The latter jurisdiction may be too broad for English tastes.
Thus it has been stated (H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell,
2021), para 6–115) that it:
gives rise to the difficulties that there appear to be no clear limits to its scope, and that this lack of clarity is a
regrettable source of uncertainty. The doctrine is, moreover, hard to reconcile with a number of fundamental
principles of English law, such as the non-enforceability of informal gratuitous promises (even if relied on) and
the rule that there is no right to damages for a wholly innocent non-contractual misrepresentation.
The fourth point relates to the remedy. Brennan J is clearly of the view that the aim of
the remedy is to compensate the promisee for his detrimental reliance on the promise.
The judgment of Mason CJ and Wilson J is more equivocal. They state that the doctrine
extends to the ‘enforcement of voluntary promises’ and, in so stating, appear to envisage
that the remedy may extend to the protection of the expectation interest. The split
between those who see the function of estoppel as being to compensate for detrimental
reliance and those who see it as being to fulfil the expectations engendered by the
promise was further evident in the decision of the High Court in 
Commonwealth of
Australia
 
v. 
Verwayen
 
(1990) 170 CLR 394. In 
Giumelli
 
v. 
Giumelli
 
(1999) 196 CLR 101
the High Court took a step in the direction of recognizing the expectation measure as the
presumptive remedy in estoppel cases when they stated that ‘often the only way to
prevent the promisee suffering detriment will be to enforce the promise’.
Waltons Stores
 
is a difficult case for English lawyers as it raises in stark form the
problem that English law has in terms of justifying the difference in principle that
currently exists between proprietary and promissory estoppel (in that only proprietary
estoppel can create a cause of action). Had the Mahers been promised an interest in
Waltons’ land they might have had a claim against Waltons on the basis of proprietary
estoppel. But the fact that they were not, and that it was Waltons who were promised an
interest in their land, has the consequence that the case cannot come within the fold of
proprietary estoppel and it may be left in the wilderness of promissory estoppel (which
cannot create a cause of action). This difference in treatment cannot be justified. Why
does English law continue to differentiate between proprietary estoppel and promissory
estoppel in relation to the creation of causes of action? Professor Treitel states (
Some
Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract Law
 
(Oxford University Press, 2002), p.
40):
Exactly why proprietary estoppel can give rise to a cause of action while promissory estoppel cannot is not made
at all clear in the English cases. One possible explanation is that the proprietary estoppel cases originally
involved an element of unjust enrichment (though some modern cases apply the doctrine even in the absence of
this factor), while promissory estoppel could arise from mere action in reliance by the promisee; and that this
was regarded as a less strong ground (than unjust enrichment) for relief.
This is not a convincing explanation for the difference between proprietary and
promissory estoppel. Either they both should be able to create a new cause of action or
neither of them should be able to do so. The proposition that one can and one cannot is
a proposition that can no longer (if it ever could) be justified.
5.3.6
 
Locating Estoppels
One of the real difficulties with estoppel lies in locating its position within the law of
obligations. Take the straightforward case of the party who relies to his detriment upon
a promise that is not supported by consideration. What legal basis does such a promisee
have for maintaining that he has a cause of action against the defaulting promisor? The
question is not an academic one. It is a profoundly practical question as has become
evident in the context of the analysis of the remedies available in estoppel cases. Is the
aim of the remedy to protect the claimant’s reliance interest or to protect his expectation
interest? The answer to this question depends, in large part, upon the nature of the
cause of action that the claimant 
asserts. So what is the legal basis of an estoppel claim?
There appear to be six possible bases. It is, however, possible to take the view that
estoppel straddles more than one of these bases (in particular, it can be argued that, in
certain circumstances, estoppel is contractual in nature but that in other circumstances
it operates to provide a remedy for a wrong).
The first view is that the claim is contractual in nature. On this view the effect of the
estoppel is to render the promise legally enforceable. Estoppel thus functions as an
alternative to consideration in that it renders a promise enforceable once there has been
detrimental reliance upon it. Thus Professor Birks has argued (‘Equity in the Modern
Law: An Exercise in Taxonomy’ (1996) 26 
University of Western Australia Law Review
1, 63) that:
Estoppels have all along been binding promises. … Detrimental reliance promises, binding with limited legal
effect, have become and are becoming binding with general effect. But, if that is right, there is no point at all in
continuing to call them estoppels. In a jurisdiction where detrimental reliance promises are binding with
general effect it has become true that promises are contracts when made by deed, supported by consideration or
relied on to the detriment of the promisee.
Adoption of this view leads to the conclusion that the remedies available in estoppel
cases are the normal contractual remedies, the aim of which is generally to protect the
expectation interest.
The second view is that the estoppel acts as a cause of action to enforce promises and
that it operates in a manner akin to contract but that it is not the same as a contractual
claim. This view has been taken by Professor (now Justice) Edelman (‘Remedial
Certainty or Remedial Discretion in Estoppel after 
Giumelli
’ (1999) 15 
Journal of
Contract Law
 
179). He argues that it is not a contract on the ground that more than a
breach of promise is required in order to trigger the operation of an estoppel. There
must be some ‘unconscionable conduct’ or detrimental reliance in order to render the
promise binding. It is the reliance that renders the promise binding rather than the
promise that renders reliance possible. Thus Professor Edelman argues (at pp. 188–189)
that, although:
an estoppel cannot be said to be a ‘contract’ it is still concerned with the enforcement of promises where not to
do so would be unconscionable and where they have caused reliance detriment. It is a different doctrine which
enforces promises in different situations.
The third view is that estoppel is part of the law of wrongs. It cannot be a tort because
tort is the label used by English law to denote a common law wrong and here we are in
the realms of equity. Support for the proposition that estoppel is a wrong can be derived
from the numerous references to ‘unconscionability’ in both judicial and academic
analyses of estoppel. On this view estoppel appears to be defendant-sided, in that it
attaches primary significance to the conduct of the promisor. But the difficulty with this
view lies in identifying the wrong that the defendant has committed. Professor Birks has
argued (at p. 64) that ‘there is no other kind of unconscionable behaviour involved other
than that which consists in failing to honour one’s promises’. Adoption of the third view
leads most naturally to the conclusion that the remedy awarded should aim to
compensate the promisee for the loss that he has suffered as a result of his reliance upon
the promise that has been made.
The fourth view of estoppel is that it is concerned with the reversal of unjust
enrichments. Take the case where A owns land and he promises to give some of the land
to B as a gift. B builds a house on A’s land in reliance upon A’s promise to give him the
land. A then revokes that promise. To allow A to go back on his word in such a case is to
allow A to enrich himself at B’s expense because he gets a house built on his land for
nothing. In such cases the courts have generally strained to give B a remedy and
proprietary estoppel has often been the remedy to which they have resorted. The case
for intervention in this example is stronger in that there is both a detriment to B and an
enrichment of A. More difficult is the case where there is a loss to B but A has not made
a gain. Unjust enrichment may provide a basis for explaining the remedy in cases where
there is a gain to the defendant and a loss to the claimant but it cannot explain the
remedy in cases where there is a loss to one party but no corresponding gain made by
the other.
The fifth view of estoppel is that the cause of action lies in equity and so it is a flexible
remedy that is available at the discretion of the court. Thus one can find references in
estoppel cases to the ‘minimum equity’ on the facts of the case and the need to tailor the
remedy to fit the facts of the case. Finn J, writing extrajudicially (‘Equitable Doctrine
and Discretion in Remedies’ in W Cornish, R Nolan, J O’Sullivan, and G Virgo (eds),
Restitution, Past, Present and Future
 
(Hart, 1998), pp. 269–270) has argued that
‘appropriateness’ should be the arbiter of the remedy granted by the court. He picks up
on the reference in both 
Waltons Stores
 
v. 
Maher
 
and 
Commonwealth of Australia
 
v.
Verwayen
 
to the ‘minimum equity to do justice to the plaintiff’ and argues (at p. 270)
that:
[t]he remedies given in estoppel cases can vary widely in character and content—monetary awards, the grants of
estates and interests in land, the truncation of the rights arising in or under contracts, etc. But … the … remedy
is not at large. Its object is detriment averting. What I would emphasise in this is that in selecting the
appropriate remedy in the circumstances there must be 
proportionality
 
between the remedy selected and its
effects, and the detriment to be avoided. This, I venture, will be found to be an important constraint on the
award of relief. And it necessitates that the selection of remedy cannot in the end be left simply to a plaintiff.
Three points should be noted about this approach. The first is that the discretion is
founded on the premise that the aim of the remedy is detriment averting. It is possible
–
–
–
–
to have a different foundation for the exercise of the discretion. In particular, it is
possible to start from the assumption that the aim of the remedy should be to give effect
to the expectation engendered by the promise but that the court should have the
discretion not to fulfil that expectation in certain circumstances. Professor Simon
Gardner takes this position (see ‘The Remedial Discretion in Proprietary Estoppel’
(1999) 115 
LQR
 
438) and this view is closer to that taken by the High Court of Australia
in 
Giumelli
 
v. 
Giumelli
 
(1999) 196 CLR 101 and by the Court of Appeal in England in
Jennings
 
v. 
Rice
 
[2002] EWCA Civ 159, [2003] 1 FCR 501, a proprietary estoppel case
(on which see S Gardner, ‘The Remedial Discretion in Proprietary Estoppel—Again’
(2006) 122 
LQR
 
492). Secondly, the extent of the discretion given to the court can vary
from a totally unstructured discretion, at one end of the spectrum, to a discretion that
can be exercised only within very narrow limits, at the other end. The former view is
difficult to defend, given the level of uncertainty it will generate. It may be that the latter
approach is the one that is closest to the position taken by the courts. Gardner has put
forward the following ((1999) 115 
LQR
 
438, 452) as a possible hypothesis for the
remedial regime for proprietary estoppel:
The approach is
to vindicate the plaintiff’s expectations (care being taken to achieve the best match between the details of
the plaintiff’s expectations and the possible legal responses);
to vindicate those expectations in specie if practicable, but otherwise in a monetary form; but
to resort to some other quantum, not more generous than the expectation measure, if it is impracticable
to give relief in the expectation measure; and
to resort to some other quantum, with no ceiling at the expectation measure, in the presence of another
factor from a limited range recognised as meriting a departure from expectation relief.
This leads us to the third point in relation to the discretionary model and that is that it
does not tell us the basis of the claim that is being made. The views advanced by Finn J
and Simon Gardner are, in many ways, refinements of options 1–3. That is to say the
cause of action remains the contract or the wrong but the court is given a discretion to
depart from the basic measure of recovery in certain limited circumstances. This
position has its attractions. Take a case where a claimant is promised a huge sum of
money by the defendant and he relies on that promise to his detriment in a relatively
minor way. In such a case a court may well baulk at the proposition that it must give the
claimant his full expectation as a result of his relatively trivial reliance. In such a case a
discretion to commute the basic expectation measure to the reliance measure may not
be unwarranted. But it is important to notice that this type of discretion is very different
from a discretion which gives the court the ability to award the measure of relief it
thinks fit, for whatever reason it thinks fit. It is a structured discretion that operates
within an initial commitment to a particular measure of recovery.
Finally, it can be argued that the basis of estoppel can be located in a ‘duty to ensure the
reliability of induced assumptions’. This view has been put forward by Dr Spence in his
book, 
Protecting Reliance: The Emergent Doctrine of Equitable Estoppel
 
(Hart, 1999).
He argues (at pp. 2–3):
The duty to ensure the reliability of induced assumptions places primary and secondary obligations on a party
who (i) induces an assumption in the mind of another party and (ii) induces the other party to rely upon that
assumption. The primary obligation is that the inducing party must, in so far as he is reasonably able, prevent
harm to the relying party. ‘Harm’ consists in the extent to which the relying party is worse off because the
assumption has proved unjustified than he would have been had it never been induced. The secondary
obligation is that, if the relying party does suffer harm of the relevant type, and the inducing party might
reasonably have prevented it, then the inducing party must compensate the relying party for the harm he has
suffered.
It is inducing reliance, rather than merely inducing an assumption, that attracts the duty to ensure the
reliability of induced assumptions. The question of whether reliance has been induced, and if so how strongly,
determines whether, and if so how strongly, the duty to ensure the reliability of induced assumptions applies.
Seven aspects of the parties’ dealings 
and relationship must be considered in determining whether, and if so
how strongly, reliance was induced. Four of these seven considerations concern the parties’ dealings. They are
(i) the way in which the assumption and reliance upon it were induced (a claim that reliance has been induced
and that the duty is owed is more plausible when there has been an express representation, than it is when there
has merely been conduct or silence), (ii) the content of the assumption (a claim that reliance has been induced
and that the duty is owed is more plausible when the relevant assumption relates to present fact, than it is when
it relates to evidently less reliable matters such as another party’s intentions), (iii) the relative knowledge of the
parties (a claim that reliance has been induced and that the duty is owed is more plausible when the inducing
party knew that the relying party would rely upon the relevant assumption) and (iv) the parties’ relative interest
in the activities undertaken in reliance on the assumption (a claim that reliance has been induced and that the
duty is owed is more plausible when the relying party is providing the inducing party with some service in the
relevant activities in reliance). Three of the seven considerations concern the parties’ relationship. They are: (i)
the nature and context of the parties’ relationship (the claim that reliance was induced and that the duty is owed
is less plausible in contexts in which a high degree of self-reliance might be expected, such as highly competitive
contexts), (ii) the parties’ relative strength of position (the claim that reliance was induced and that the duty is
owed is more plausible in situations in which there is a disparity in the parties’ strength of position in favour of
the inducing party), and (iii) the history of the parties’ relationship (the claim that reliance was induced and
that the duty is owed is more plausible as between parties with long-standing relationships of trust). I do not
claim that this list of seven considerations is necessarily exhaustive. Nor do I claim that there is no overlap
between them. For example, if parties enjoy a longstanding relationship in a context of close co-operation, it
might be assumed that one party knew that the other would rely upon an assumption he induced. However, any
consideration of the claim that one party induced another to rely upon a particular assumption must involve
assessment of at least these seven aspects of the parties’ dealings and relationship.
There are a number of difficulties with this view. The first relates to the moral basis for
this duty. In the absence of a promise, is there any justification for imposing an
obligation on the party said to have induced the assumption? As Professor Fried points
out (
Contract as Promise
 
(Harvard University Press, 1981), p. 10):
Should your expectations of me limit my freedom of choice? If you rent the apartment next to mine because I
play chamber music there, do I owe you more than an expression of regret when my friends and I decide to
meet instead at the cellist’s home? And, in general, why should my liberty be constrained by the harm you
would suffer from the disappointment of the expectations you choose to entertain about my choices?
The second difficulty relates to the complexity of the factors identified by Dr Spence. It
does not give the appearance of providing a high degree of predictive yield when applied
to concrete fact situations. The third is that, while it may be consistent with the results
in many of the cases, it does not conform with the language of the courts.
Enough has been said to demonstrate that the theoretical basis of estoppel remains a
matter of difficulty and it is, perhaps, for this reason that the courts have had so many
problems in terms of working out the appropriate remedy in estoppel cases. The basic
choice that has to be made is between a model that aims to protect detrimental reliance
(options (iii) and (vi)) and one that aims to fulfil the expectations engendered by the
promise (options (i) and (ii)). That choice can be refined through the exercise of a
discretion (option (v)) by which the court can depart from the basic measure of recovery
in certain, exceptional circumstances. While English law adheres to the rule that
estoppel cannot create a cause of action it is spared the need overtly to answer some of
these questions. In the context of proprietary estoppel, the English courts have inclined
to the view that the measure of recovery is prima facie the expectation measure but that
the courts have a discretion to depart from it in certain circumstances. A similar view
would appear to have emerged in Australia in relation to equitable estoppel. The
likelihood is that English courts will adopt this view in the event that they decide that
promissory estoppel can create a new cause of action.
5.4
 
The Future of Consideration
As was noted at the beginning of this chapter, the doctrine of consideration, while it has
its defenders (see M Chen-Wishart, ‘Reciprocity and Enforceability’ in M Chen-Wishart,
L Ho, and P Kapai, 
Reciprocity in Contract
 
(University of Hong Kong, 2010) p. 1) is a
doctrine that is under attack. It does not appear to fit with the demands of commercial
practice and it is difficult to explain its existence and content in theoretical terms.
Further, as a result of the tension that exists between 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
, on the
one hand, and 
Foakes
 
v. 
Beer
, on the other, the doctrine cannot even be said to be
internally coherent. Things are not much better when we turn to estoppel. The law
exhibits a high degree of uncertainty, particularly in relation to the remedies available,
the differences between the various estoppels, and in relation to the question whether or
not promissory estoppel should be able to create a cause of action.
In these circumstances it is possible that the courts will intervene to set the law on a
fresh foundation. But there is little evidence of judicial appetite for such far-reaching
reforms. However, it is not impossible that a modern court will take on the challenge. In
Gay Choon Ing
 
v. 
Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter
 
[2009] 2 SLR 332 Andrew B L Phang JA,
delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Singapore, took the rather unusual
step of adding a coda to the judgment of the court which analysed the history and
rationale of the doctrine of consideration, identified the difficulties to which it currently
gives rise, and concluded with the following assessment of the alternatives open to the
courts (or the legislature) in the future:
Possible alternatives
The alternatives stated
111. It is axiomatic, in our view, that if the doctrine of consideration is indeed abolished (whether judicially or
legislatively), the function it has hitherto performed must be fulfilled by alternative doctrines … There have
been a number of suggestions … [these] include the doctrine of promissory estoppel … and the doctrine of
economic duress …
112.
 
Indeed, given the at least possible linkages between economic duress on the one hand and 
undue
influence and unconscionability on the other … there is no reason in principle why undue influence and
unconscionability ought not also to be potential alternatives (although unconscionability is still a fledgling
doctrine in the Commonwealth law of contract) …
113.
 
On a more general level, the doctrines of economic duress, undue influence and unconscionability
appear to be more clearly suited not only to modern commercial circumstances but also (more importantly) to
situations where there has been possible ‘extortion’. There is also the proposal of the UK Committee to the effect
that consideration is merely evidence of a serious intention to contract, with the result that it should not be
required where the promise itself is in writing.
The difficulties
114. We pause to observe, if only in the briefest of fashions, that the possible alternatives to the doctrine of
consideration set out so very cursorily in the preceding paragraphs are 
themselves
 
subject to 
their own specific
difficulties
. For example, the fledgling nature of the doctrine of unconscionability … The doctrine of undue
influence, however, has been relatively well established in the landscape of the common law of contract,
although the doctrine of economic duress (being of very recent origin by common law standards) … stands
somewhere in the ‘middle’ (being not without difficulties of its own).
115.
 
On the other hand, the doctrine of promissory estoppel still contains pockets of controversy. One issue
that arises is whether it can be used as a ‘sword’ (
ie
, as a cause of action in and of itself) or merely as a ‘shield’
(
ie
, merely as a defence, which (it should be noted) applies (depending on the precise facts) equally to plaintiffs
and defendants alike) … To take another example, the role of the concept of detriment may still need further
elaboration … Finally, the issue as to whether or not the doctrine of promissory estoppel is only suspensory in
operation may also require further consideration …
116.
 
Indeed, even in the context of 
proprietary estoppel
, the law has not been static (see, for example, the
very recent House of Lords decision of 
Yeoman’s Row Management Ltd
 
v. Cobbe [2008] 1 WLR 1752). Finally,
the UK Committee’s proposal to the effect that consideration should not be required where the promise
concerned is in writing is also not free from difficulties … All this having been said, it is almost inevitable that no
doctrine is immune from its own specific difficulties although, from a relative perspective, the courts would be
wise to utilise only those doctrines with relatively fewer difficulties.
A pragmatic approach?
117. Because so much academic ink has been spilt on the doctrine of consideration over so very many decades
(with no concrete action being taken) and because there is … such a dearth of cases on the doctrine itself, it
would appear that any proposed reform of the doctrine is much ado about nothing. Indeed, the doctrine of
consideration is (notwithstanding the numerous critiques of it) nevertheless still (as also noted) an established
part of not only the Singapore landscape in particular but also the common law landscape in general. Not
surprisingly, it is a standard topic in all the contract textbooks. In short, it cannot be ignored. However, because
the doctrine of consideration 
does
 
contain certain basic weaknesses which have been pointed out, 
in extenso
, in
the relevant legal literature, it almost certainly needs to be reformed. The basic difficulties and alternatives have
been set out briefly above but will need to be considered in much greater detail when the issue next comes
squarely before this court. One major difficulty lies in the fact that a legal mechanism must be maintained that
will enable the courts to effectively and practically ascertain which promises ought to be enforceable. Hence,
even if the doctrine of consideration is abolished, an alternative (or alternatives) must take its place. There then
arises the question as to whether 
or not the alternatives themselves are sufficiently well established in order that
they might furnish the requisite legal guidance to the courts. In this regard, it is significant to note that the
various alternatives briefly mentioned above 
are (apart from the requirement of writing) already a part of
Singapore law
.
118.
 
In the circumstances, maintenance of the 
status quo
 
(
viz
, the availability of both (a somewhat dilute)
doctrine of consideration 
as well as
 
the alternative doctrines canvassed above) may well be the 
most practical
solution inasmuch as it will afford the courts 
a range of legal options
 
to achieve a just and fair result in the case
concerned. However, problems of 
theoretical
 
coherence may remain and are certainly intellectually challenging
(as the many perceptive pieces and even books and monographs clearly demonstrate). Nevertheless, given the
long pedigree of the doctrine, the fact that no single doctrine is wholly devoid of difficulties, and (more
importantly) the need for a legal mechanism to ascertain which promises the courts will enforce, the ‘theoretical
untidiness’ may well be acceptable in the light of the existing practical advantages … However, this is obviously
a provisional view only as the issue of reform was not before the court in the present appeal.
While this coda holds out the possibility of significant judicial reform (or abolition) of
the doctrine of consideration, it remains the case that there are surprisingly few calls for
reform of the doctrine from the world of practice. Why is this? Lord Steyn, writing
extrajudicially (‘Contract Law: Fulfilling the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men’
(1997) 113 
LQR
 
433, 437) stated:
I have no radical proposals for the wholesale review of the doctrine of consideration. I am not persuaded that it
is necessary. And great legal changes should only be embarked on when they are truly necessary. First, there are
a few cases where even in modern times courts have decided that contractual claims must fail for want of
consideration. On the other hand, on careful examination it will usually be found that such claims could have
been decided on other grounds, e.g. the absence of an intention to create legal relations or the fact that the
transaction was induced by duress. Once a serious intention to enter into legal relations and a concluded
agreement is demonstrated in a commercial context there is virtually a presumption of consideration which will
almost invariably prevail without a detailed search for some technical consideration. On balance it seems to me
that in modern practice the restrictive influence of consideration has markedly receded in importance.
Secondly, it seems to me that in recent times the courts have shown a readiness to hold that the rigidity of the
doctrine of consideration must yield to practical justice and the needs of modern commerce.
Letters of credit provide a useful illustration of the way in which the doctrine of
consideration is made to yield to the needs of modern commerce. Letters of credit are
often used in the financing of international sales transactions. Sellers generally wish to
know that they have a secure right to payment before they ship goods, while buyers are
usually reluctant to pay for the goods before receiving them. Letters of credit can break
this impasse. The buyer will instruct his bank (the issuing bank, ‘IB’) to open a letter of
credit in favour of the seller under which the bank promises to pay the price to the seller
on presentation by the seller of the documents relating to the goods. In this way the
seller knows that it has a secure right of payment against the bank when it presents the
documents. The buyer is also given some 
protection in that, if the seller presents non-
conforming documents, the bank must reject the documents and refuse to pay unless
authorized by the buyer to pay. On what basis is the bank obliged to pay the seller under
the letter of credit? This issue is considered in the following passage (
Goode and
McKendrick on Commercial Law
 
(6th edn, Penguin, 2020), paras 35.49–35.51):
In banking usage an irrevocable credit binds IB upon issue of the credit, … that is, upon the credit’s release from
the control of the issuer …, irrespective of the time it is delivered to or received by the beneficiary, S. If the credit
is rejected by S, for example, because it does not conform to the contract of sale, it ceases to have effect.
Though there is no reported case since the adoption of the ‘irrevocable’ label [that is to say, that the credit is
irrevocable by the bank upon issue] in which the point has directly arisen for determination, there are several
dicta in English cases indicating judicial acceptance of the binding nature of the credit by virtue of the issue of
the document. … The problem is to reconcile the binding nature of the bank’s undertaking with traditional
concepts of general law, which deny legal effect to a simple promise unless consideration is furnished by the
promisee, producing a contract, or the promisee is induced to act in reliance on the promise, generating some
form of estoppel. The difficulty created by the undertaking embodied in an irrevocable letter of credit is that it
appears to be binding on IB, and enforceable by S, despite the fact that S has furnished no consideration for IB’s
promise and, indeed, may not have taken steps to act upon it nor even have signified his assent to its terms. …
How, then, can the bank concerned become bound to the beneficiary solely by virtue of the issue of the letter of
credit to him?
Various ingenious theories have been advanced designed to accommodate the binding nature of the bank’s
undertaking within the framework of traditional contract law. All of these fall to the ground because, in an
endeavour to produce an acceptable theoretical solution, they distort the character of the transaction and
predicate facts and intentions at variance with what is in practice done and intended by the parties. The defects
in these various theories show the undesirability of trying to force all commercial instruments and devices into a
strait-jacket of traditional rules of law. Professor Ellinger has rightly argued that the letter of credit should be
treated as a 
sui generis
 
instrument embodying a promise which by mercantile usage is enforceable without
consideration. Professor Kozolchyk takes the description a stage further, treating a letter of credit as a new type
of mercantile currency embodying an abstract promise of payment, which, like the bill of exchange, possesses a
high, though not total, immunity from attack on the ground of breach of duty of S to B.
The adaptability of consideration may be said to be its strength. The ability to find
consideration has been described as the practice of ‘inventing’ consideration. This
practice has been described in the following terms (GH Treitel, 
The Law of Contract
(15th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited by Edwin Peel), para 3–009):
Normally, a party enters into a contract with a view to obtaining the consideration provided by the other, eg, the
buyer wants the goods and the seller the price. In the US it has been said that this is essential, and that ‘Nothing
is consideration that is not regarded as such by both parties’. But English courts do not insist on this
requirement and often regard an act or 
forbearance as the consideration for a promise even though it may not
have been the object of the promisor to secure it, or the promisee may not have consciously realised that he was
giving what was, in fact, consideration. They may also regard the possibility of some prejudice to the promisee
as a detriment without regard to the question whether it has in fact been suffered. These practices may be called
‘inventing consideration’, and the temptation to adopt one or the other of them is particularly strong when the
act or forbearance which was actually bargained for cannot be regarded as consideration for some reason which
is thought to be technical and without merit. In such cases the practice of inventing consideration may help to
make the operation of the doctrine of consideration more acceptable; but the practice may also be criticised on
the ground that it gives the courts a wide discretion to hold promises binding (or not) as they please. Thus the
argument that the promisee 
might
 
have suffered prejudice by acting in reliance on a promise is in some cases
made a basis of decision, while in others precisely the same argument is rejected. The courts have not been very
consistent in the exercise of this discretion and its existence is a source of considerable uncertainty in this
branch of the law.
But not all writers have adopted such an accommodating approach towards the doctrine
of consideration. Its principal critic has been Professor Atiyah. He famously attacked the
doctrine of consideration in a lengthy essay, entitled ‘Consideration: A Restatement’
(contained in 
Essays on Contract
 
(Oxford University Press, 1986), pp. 179–243), the
beginning and the conclusion of which are reproduced:
pp. 180–183
The conventional statement of the doctrine of consideration is not perhaps as easily reduced to a simple set
of rules as it is often assumed, but few would disagree with the following propositions. First, a promise is not
enforceable (if not under seal
), unless the promisor obtains some benefit or the promisee incurs some
detriment in return for the promise. A subsidiary proposition, whose claim to be regarded as a part of the
orthodox doctrine is perhaps less certain, is sometimes put forward, namely that consideration must be of
economic value. Secondly, in a bilateral contract the consideration for a promise is a counter-promise, and in a
unilateral contract consideration is the performance of the act specified by the promisor. Thirdly, the law of
contract only enforces bargains; the consideration must, in short, be (and perhaps even be regarded by the
parties as) the ‘price’ of the promise. Fourthly, past consideration is not sufficient consideration. Fifthly,
consideration must move from the promisee. Sixthly (and this is regarded as following from the first three
propositions), the law does not enforce gratuitous promises. Seventhly, a limited exception to these
propositions is recognized by the 
High Trees
 
principle which, however, only enables certain promises without
consideration to be set up by way of defence.
More generally, it would, I think, be commonly agreed that there is such a concept as a ‘doctrine of
consideration’. This very phrase carries certain implications. In particular it implies that there is 
one
 
doctrine,
and 
one
 
concept. The word ‘consideration’ is invariably used in the singular. Lawyers do not today inquire what
are 
the considerations
 
which lead a court to enforce a promise, but whether 
there is
 
consideration. The word
‘doctrine’ also appears to 
carry certain implications. In this particular area of the law, it seems to carry the
implication that the ‘doctrine’ is ‘artificial’, and has no rational foundation except possibly in so far as it may be
argued that gratuitous promises should not necessarily be enforceable.
It is my purpose to suggest that the conventional account of the law is unsatisfactory, and that scarcely one
of the propositions set out above accurately represents the law. But it is necessary to start by suggesting that one
of the principal reasons for the present divergence between the conventional account of the law and its actual
operation arises from the more general beliefs about the existence of a set of artificial and irrational rules
termed the doctrine of consideration. The truth is that the courts have never set out to create a doctrine of
consideration. They have been concerned with the much more practical problem of deciding in the course of
litigation whether a particular promise in a particular case should be enforced. Since it is unthinkable that any
legal system could enforce 
all
 
promises it has always been necessary for the courts to decide which promises
they would enforce. When the courts found a sufficient reason for enforcing a promise they enforced it; and
when they found that for one reason or another it was undesirable to enforce a promise, they did not enforce it.
It seems highly probable that when the courts first used the word ‘consideration’ they meant no more than that
there was good ‘reason’ for the enforcement of a promise. If the consideration was ‘good’, this meant that the
court found sufficient reason for enforcing the promise. All this is not to suggest that the law was ever
3
unprincipled, or that judges ever decided cases according to personal or idiosyncratic views of what promises it
was desirable to enforce. As always with the common law, it was the collective view of the judges, based largely
on the conditions and moral values of the community, which prevailed over a period of time. The doctrine of
precedent, then as now, was always available as an aid to the courts in deciding what promises to enforce.
The notion that consideration means a reason for the enforcement of a promise was largely borrowed in my
original essay from Corbin, and although Professor Treitel has objected to this, and insisted that it cannot just
be asserted that this is what consideration means, it seems clear to me that it is both a historical and an
analytical truth. I will not inquire further into the historical use of the term here, but at least it must be admitted
that in modern law the presence of consideration is a necessary condition for the enforceability of a promise,
leaving aside the promissory estoppel and other ‘non-contractual’ means of enforcement. To translate that into
saying that consideration means a 
reason
 
for the enforcement of a promise only requires us to make the
assumption that the law is a rational enterprise. To assert that the law ‘will not do A unless B’ surely entails, if
law is purposive in its nature, that the presence of B is a 
reason
 
for doing A—unless (which can hardly be
suggested here) it is merely a condition for the doing of A. Of course this does not carry the implication that the
reason
 
is always a good one; nor that sometimes the reason ought not to be outweighed by other reasons. But
unless the presence of consideration is regarded, in general terms, as a reason for the enforcement of promises,
the whole doctrine would have to be treated as mumbo-jumbo. Doubtless the law is sometimes irrational, but to
treat a whole doctrine of the law as irrational implies both an extraordinary lack of faith in the intelligence of
former judges, and an astonishing perversity in the erection of a system of precedent which requires that their
decisions should be followed. I decline to make either of these assumptions.
Professor Treitel’s critique of my original essay (and his textbook on the 
Law of Contract
) insists that the
courts have power to ‘invent’ consideration, and that this ability is an important phenomenon which I have
overlooked and which explains many otherwise puzzling things about the doctrine. I find this a difficult concept
to grasp. Is an ‘invented’ consideration something different from a ‘real’ consideration or is it the same thing? If
it is the same thing, then it is hard to see in what sense it is invented; and if it is not the same thing, then it
either violates 
the rules of law, or it modifies them. Presumably Professor Treitel does not mean to suggest that
when judges invent consideration they are defying the law and violating their judicial oaths, but if an invented
consideration modifies the rules governing ordinary consideration, then an invented consideration becomes
again an ordinary consideration, though the legal significance of the doctrine has now changed. The only other
possibility that occurs to me is that the courts might use the concept of ‘invented consideration’ rather like an
equitable or merciful dispensation from the ordinary law, but it is unthinkable that judges should behave in this
way. They have no power to invent a consideration in one case and refuse to do so in a relatively identical case.
Thus an invented consideration must in the end be the same thing as an ordinary consideration. I fear that
Professor Treitel has himself invented the concept of an invented consideration because he finds it the only way
in which he is able to reconcile many decisions with what he takes to be the ‘true’ or ‘real’ doctrine. This is, of
course, exactly the sort of process against which Corbin warned us, and I give my full allegiance to Corbin on
this point.
Nevertheless, I would today wish to qualify the suggestion that consideration ‘means’ a reason for the
enforcement of a promise. It now seems to me to be more accurate to suggest that consideration really was and
is a reason for the recognition of an obligation, rather than a reason for the enforcement of a promise. Given
that … reliance and benefit are often themselves good reasons for the recognition of obligations in law—that we
have many non-promissory cases in which the obligation is based upon an element of detrimental reliance or an
element of benefit rendered or obtained—and given also that many cases in contract law are based on implied
promises which seem more or less fictitious, the wider formulation of the function of consideration seems more
accurate. But for the purposes of this essay, I do not think that it matters much whether I proceed on the
narrower or wider understanding of what is the general purpose of the doctrine of consideration.
pp. 240–243
The present orthodoxy therefore seems to me unnecessarily cumbrous. It would be a great deal simpler if the
courts were willing to treat action in reliance which suffices for estoppel as also sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of consideration; but it would at the same time be necessary, of course, for the courts to become
more sophisticated about when expectation protection is, and when it is not, justified. If American experience is
anything to go by, it may well be necessary to retain considerable flexibility as to when to confine contractual
redress to the protection of reliance, and when to go further; it is unwise to try to draw this line by fastening on
the absurdly narrow and unreal distinction between an action in reliance which is requested, and one which is
not requested, but merely foreseeable. Fortunately, in practice it is so easy for a court to ‘imply’ a request when
it wishes to do so, that no court which wishes directly to enforce a promise in this sort of case need find any
difficulty in doing so …
… there are, I suggest, important conclusions to be drawn from what I have tried to demonstrate. The first is
that to talk of abolition of the doctrine of consideration is nonsensical. Consideration means a reason for the
enforcement of a promise, or, even more broadly, a reason for the recognition of an obligation. If the broader
sense is right, then, of course, talk of abolition is quite absurd. But even if one takes only the narrower sense, it
is hard to take seriously talk of abolition. Nobody can seriously propose that all promises should become
enforceable; to abolish the doctrine of consideration, therefore, is simply to require the courts to begin all over
again the task of deciding what promises are to be enforceable. They will, of course, have to use new technical
justifications for this task, and the obvious one that lies to 
hand is the ‘intent to create legal relations’. No doubt
there is something to be said for beginning this task all over again, and for using a new technique for this
purpose. Changes in social and commercial conditions, and changes in the moral values of the community,
mean that the courts will not always find the same reasons for the enforcement of promises to be good today as
their forbears did; equally, it is likely that they will often find good reasons for the enforcement of promises
where their predecessors did not. Moreover, I think there is less likelihood of the ‘intent to create legal relations’
formula ossifying into a ‘doctrine’; though there is the converse danger that its application may create
uncertainty as to what promises will be enforceable. But I question whether the ‘intent to create legal relations’
formula will in the long run work any better than the rules of consideration.
In particular, I believe that the problems arising from the enforcement of gratuitous promises are too
complex to be adequately dealt with by either the rules of consideration or the ‘intent to create legal relations’
formula. For a start, the ‘intent’ formula can only be squared with the importance of detrimental reliance by
repeated use of fictions. And if it should be suggested that the law should be more willing to enforce gratuitous
promises, I believe that it will be necessary to start by asking more about the concept of a ‘gratuitous’ promise.
To be legally enforceable, gratuitous promises will presumably need to be sensible, rational activities. But surely
we then need to ask more about the kind of circumstances in which people do rationally make gratuitous
promises, and we may need to distinguish various classes of cases. For instance, there are promises made in a
commercial context which may appear gratuitous, but where the promisor expects some return in a rather more
indirect way than the present doctrine of consideration recognizes. There is a lot to be said for the view that
such promises are really bargain promises, and should be fully enforceable, even while executory, to the same
extent as ordinary contracts. (But there is also a lot to be said for achieving this result by modification of the
present rather rigid view of what kind of benefit constitutes sufficient consideration.) Then there are gratuitous
charitable promises, gratuitous family promises, and so on. Above all, of course, there is the distinction between
gratuitous relied-upon and unrelied-upon promises.
Whether unrelied-upon gratuitous promises should ever be rendered enforceable seems to me a very
dubious proposition, and even if the principle is conceded, such promises are difficult to generalise about in
advance, because so much depends upon the context out of which they arise. It may conceivably be found
desirable to enforce gratuitous promises in a much wider range of circumstances than exists at the moment, but
(1)
(a)
(b)
(c)
(2)
not to the same extent as ordinary commercial promises. For instance, it may be found wise to render some
gratuitous promises enforceable in principle against the promisor, but not necessarily against his executors.
Whether this would be just may well depend on his family obligations, and the solvency of his estate. It may be
wise to provide for a much wider defence of frustration in the case of gratuitous promises, if they are to become
enforceable while yet unrelied upon. A man promises his son an allowance while the latter is at the university; it
may be just and equitable to enforce this promise, but would it remain just and equitable if the promisor
became incapacitated and lost his job? Perhaps, too, a wider latitude should be allowed to some form of defence
based on mistake. Perhaps we need to consider a shorter limitation period. And perhaps after all some
gratuitous promises may be better treated as merely giving rise to a defence rather than a cause of action.
Certainly we shall need to consider whether the same rules will be appropriate for all kinds of gratuitous
promises. A promise to render gratuitous services is not necessarily in like case with a promise to make a cash
gift; and a promise of money to a charity is not necessarily the same as a promise made to a member of the
family. In short we must look to the reasons (or considerations) which make it just or desirable to enforce
promises, and also to the extent to which it is just to enforce them.
Professor Atiyah’s attack has been the subject of a counter-attack by Professor Treitel
(‘Consideration: A Critical Analysis of Professor Atiyah’s Fundamental Restatement’
(1976) 50 
Australian Law Journal
 
439) principally on the ground that his proposal that
the courts should look to the reasons which make it just or desirable to enforce promises
(or obligations) is too vague to provide a workable standard.
Given all of these criticisms of the doctrine of consideration, it is unlikely that English
law would adopt the doctrine of consideration were it to be given the opportunity to
start afresh. International restatements on contract law find no role for the doctrine.
Thus Article 2:101 of the Principles of European Contract Law states that:
A contract is concluded if:
the parties intend to be legally bound; and
they reach a sufficient agreement
without any further requirement.
A contract need not be concluded or evidenced in writing nor is it subject to any other requirement as to
form. The contract may be proved by any means, including witnesses.
Article 3.1.2 of the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts provides
that ‘a contract is concluded, modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the
parties, without any further requirement’.
But the fact is that English law has not been given, and may never be given, the
opportunity to start afresh. This being the case, it is unlikely that the courts will, for the
reasons given by Lord Steyn (earlier in this section), abandon the doctrine. They are
more likely to continue the process, evident in cases such as 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros
, of
being more willing to find the existence of consideration where they believe that the
parties intended to be bound by their agreement. One consequence of this may be that
greater prominence will be given to the doctrine of intention to create legal relations, to
which we shall turn in 
Chapter 7
.
 
The requirement of a seal has since been abolished. It now suffices for the promise to be made in the form of a deed:

Formalities
Central Issues
Requirements of form (such as writing) are not as important today as
they were in the past. As a general rule, contracts can be made in any
form and can be proved by any means. Commercial parties generally
reduce their contract to written form but this is for reasons of practical
convenience, not legal compulsion.
However, there remain exceptional cases where the law does insist
upon requirements of form. The reasons for continued reliance upon
requirements of form are considered in this chapter, together with the
criticisms that are advanced against such requirements.
The only example in English contract law of a formal requirement
which is sufficient in itself to render a promise binding is a promise
that is made in a deed. The deed is a useful device in commercial
practice. Where there is no consideration for a promise or there is a
doubt about the presence of consideration, the promise can be
rendered enforceable by the simple device of making use of a deed.
There are other cases where the formal requirement is an 
additional
,
necessary
 
pre-requisite that must be satisfied if the contract is to be
binding (in other words the agreement must also be supported by
consideration, etc). The formal requirement may take different forms.
The principal forms are (i) the contract must be made in writing, (ii) it
must be evidenced in writing, or (iii) it must be made by deed.
6.1
 
Introduction
It is an old joke that an oral contract is not worth the paper it is written on. This reflects
a general perception, common among laypersons, that they are not bound by a contract
until they ‘sign on the dotted line’. However, this perception is misconceived since an
oral contract is generally just as binding as a written one. It may prove advantageous to
the parties to record the terms of their agreement in writing in order to minimize the
risk of dispute at a later stage. Indeed, because of the desire for certainty, particularly
valuable contracts will invariably take written form. But a contract is in general legally
binding 
notwithstanding the lack of written evidence. To this general principle certain
exceptions have been made. In some circumstances a contract will be unenforceable
unless it is evidenced in writing. In other circumstances a contract will be void unless it
is actually made in writing. Finally, there are certain types of transaction which must be
made in the form of a deed that is signed before witnesses. These requirements are
referred to in this chapter as ‘formalities’, ‘formal requirements’, or ‘requirements of
form’ (all three terms being interchangeable).
As Professor Kötz has pointed out (
European Contract Law
 
(2nd edn, Oxford
University Press, 2017), p. 73):
All legal systems in Europe have rules which invalidate certain contracts if specified formalities are ignored.
Such rules are commonly regarded as exceptional, the general principle being that no formalities are required.
This statement is generally true of English contract law. It does have rules that have the
effect of invalidating a limited class of contracts in the event of a failure to comply with
certain prescribed formal requirements. But these rules are very much the exception.
The general rule is that the parties are free to decide for themselves the form that their
contract is to assume. If they wish to impose upon themselves a formal requirement they
are free to do so. Further, parties can make a requirement of form a condition precedent
to the existence of any contractual obligation provided that they use sufficiently clear
words to this effect. Thus in 
Winn
 
v. 
Bull
 
(1877) 7 Ch D 29, 32 Jessel MR stated that:
where you have a proposal or agreement made in writing expressed to be subject to a formal contract being
prepared, it means what it says; it is subject to and is dependent upon a formal contract being prepared.
Equally, contracting parties can impose on themselves formal requirements in relation
to the variation of their contracts. Thus it is not uncommon for parties to include in their
contracts a ‘no oral modification clause’ which provides that variations to the contract
will only be given effect if made in a prescribed form, such as in writing and signed by
both parties. The Supreme Court has held, in a decision that has both its supporters and
its critics, that such clauses are valid and binding with the consequence that a variation
which does not comply with the prescribed formality will not, at least in the absence of
an estoppel, be given effect by the courts (
MWB Business Exchange Centres Ltd v Rock
Advertising Ltd
 
[2018] UKSC 24, [2019] AC 119). But in the absence of such stipulations
the law does not generally impose formal requirements: the parties can make their
contract quite informally if they wish to do so.
However, it was not always so. Formal requirements were a prominent feature of
English contract law until the second half of the twentieth century. The principal source
of these formal requirements was the Statute of Frauds 1677. Professor Simpson (
A
History of the Common Law of Contract
 
(Oxford University Press, 1975), pp. 599–600)
has stated that the ‘broad policy’ behind the Statute of Frauds was:
to require written evidence of important legal transactions as a prerequisite to their enforcement, to insist, that
is, on a measure of formality in areas in which wholly informal transactions had come to be legally effective.
Thereby the bringing of groundless suits would become more difficult, though inevitably at the cost of some
injustice to plaintiffs unable to produce written evidence.
But over time it became apparent that the ‘cost’ of the legislation was greater than the
benefits which it brought in terms of preventing parties from bringing groundless or
fraudulent claims. The Statute gradually fell into disrepute as it came to be used by
those who wished to get out of their agreements on the ‘technical’ ground that the
agreement did not comply with the prescribed formalities and so was not enforceable. It
was largely (but not entirely) repealed in 1954 by the Law Reform (Enforcement of
Contracts) Act 1954. This repeal is consistent with the modern trend which, with the
notable exception of a deed (on which see 
6.3.1
), is to place less emphasis on formal
requirements in the law of contract. The reduced significance of formal requirements
can be seen in both the Principles of European Contract Law and the Unidroit Principles
of International Commercial Contracts. Article 2:101(2) of the Principles of European
Contract Law provides that:
[a] contract need not be concluded or evidenced in writing nor is it subject to any other requirement as to form.
The contract may be proved by any means, including witnesses.
While Article 1.2 of the Unidroit Principles provides that:
[n]othing in these Principles requires a contract, statement or any other act to be made in or evidenced by a
particular form. It may be proved by any means, including witnesses.
The similarity between these two provisions is striking and it demonstrates the measure
of consensus that currently exists in relation to the declining significance of formal
requirements. However, before we consign formal requirements to the dustbin of
history, it is important to notice that this consensus is largely confined to the sphere of
commercial contracts. When we turn to consumer contracts a very different picture
emerges. The point has been well put by Professor Kötz (p. 74) in the following terms:
[I]t would be a mistake to suppose that formalities are no longer important in modern systems—quite the
contrary. New formal requirements are constantly being imposed everywhere, in the name of consumer
protection, to such an extent that in France there has been much discussion of the 
renaissance de formalisme
.
A number of examples of formal requirements imposed in the name of consumer
protection can be found in English law (see, for example, the Consumer Credit Act 1974,
sections 60 and 61 and the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange
Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/2960), regulation 15). Before examining the circumstances
in which English law imposes formal requirements on contracting parties it is worth
considering the reasons that lead legal systems to make use of requirements of form.
6.2
 
The Reasons for Formal Requirements
Why do legal systems impose formal requirements upon contracting parties? The
question has to be asked given the obvious disadvantages that attend such requirements.
They are open to criticism on a number of grounds. In the first place, they tend to be
time-consuming, cumbersome, and bureaucratic. Secondly, it is not easy to decide
which out of the millions 
of contracts that are entered into on a daily basis should be
subject to formal requirements. Thirdly, the content of the formal requirement can be
difficult to prescribe. In the past the formal requirement was often one of writing but,
given the increasing use of electronic means of communication, is it sensible to continue
to insist upon writing? Further, should the contract be made in writing or should it
suffice that it is evidenced in writing? Finally, difficulties arise where the parties do not
comply with the formal requirements, especially in the case where the parties were
unaware of their existence. Should the courts always refuse to give effect to a contract
that does not comply with a requirement of form?
Powerful though these objections are, they are not conclusive. There does remain a role
for requirements of form in the modern law. While recognizing the difficulties that they
can bring, the case for a limited role for formal requirements has been made by
Professor Kötz (
European Contract Law
 
(2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2017), pp.
75–76), in the context of an analysis of the development of contract law in Europe, in the
following terms:
It takes time and trouble to meet formal requirements—the text has to be drafted, properly recorded, and signed
by the parties. The law therefore imposes such requirements only if there is some good reason for doing so.
One such reason has to do with 
proof
 
and 
evidence
. Parties whose agreement is purely verbal may easily find
themselves in disagreement over what was agreed and when. If they put their undertakings and agreements in
writing, such disputes are still possible, but they are much less likely.
Other formal requirements have the alternative or additional purpose of putting the parties on 
notice
.
Requiring a person who is about to embark on an important undertaking to go through a formality affords him
a final chance to reflect on what he is doing. This is desirable not only when the transaction is an important one,
but also when it is one-sided: a party giving something for nothing may need to be protected from impulsive
generosity or exposure to unconsidered risks. This is why donative promises and guarantees are always
subjected to formal requirements. The written-form requirement does not necessarily afford much time for
reflection since it does not take long to draw up and sign a guarantee agreement, yet people—especially laymen
—have the impression that when a pen is put in their hand they are entering the sphere of obligation, and this
concentrates the mind on the question whether they really want to engage in a legally enforceable transaction.
Sometimes formalities are required in order to mark the 
transition
 
from negotiation to contract. In
circumstances where pre-contractual negotiations tend to be prolonged, the parties can easily disagree on
whether the negotiations have reached the stage of agreement and legal obligation. But if the contract has to be
in writing or notarized, the answer is clear. Parties know that nothing they say or write during the negotiations
is binding in law and that they may break off the negotiations without liability; they also know that they should
not rely on what the other party has said until it is put into the correct legal form.
Modern legislation increasingly requires that a contract be put into writing when one of the parties to it
needs special protection. Since these contracts are put into writing anyway, it may seem superfluous for the law
to make it mandatory. In fact, the law is not so much concerned with the written form as such: it seeks to ensure
that the party needing protection is provided with certain information before or at the time the contract is
concluded. The purpose of this written-form requirement is to 
provide information
. … Such regulation is
doubtless well-intentioned, but it is doubtful whether it is effective. A consumer in urgent need of money will
hardly be deterred from accepting credit by the mass of information he has to be given, though it will prevent
him saying afterwards that he did not know what he was letting 
himself in for. Good deeds overdone can be a
bane. Man’s ability to process information thrust on him is limited. The costs of such paternalistic legislation
are sometimes underestimated. They comprise not only the cost of paper and printing, but also the legal
uncertainty which results from the courts forever having to deal with the question of the sanctions to be applied
—in particular whether the protected party can withdraw from the contract on the basis of a contravention of
the duty to provide information, when he may have quite different reasons for wanting to get out of the
obligation. [Emphasis in the original.]

Formal Requirements in English Contract
Law
When considering the role of formal requirements in English contract law it is
important to distinguish two different types of case. The first is the case where the
formal requirement is both necessary and sufficient to render the promise binding. This
is the case of a gratuitous promise made in a deed: such a promise is binding
notwithstanding the fact that it is not supported by consideration. The second is the case
where the formal requirement is necessary but not sufficient to render a promise
binding. In other words, the formal requirement is an additional hurdle to the usual
requirements of a binding contract that must be satisfied by the parties.
6.3.1
 
Formal Requirements Which Are Sufficient
to Render the Promise Binding
The only example in English contract law of a formal requirement which is sufficient in
itself to render a promise binding is a promise that is made in a deed. Until relatively
recently, the deed had to be made under seal but the requirement of sealing was
abolished by the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989. The rules
applicable to deeds are to be found in section 1 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1989, the principal provisions of which provide:
Deeds and their execution
(1) Any rule of law which—
restricts the substances on which a deed may be written;
requires a seal for the valid execution of an instrument as a deed by an individual; or
requires authority by one person to another to deliver an instrument as a deed on his behalf to be
given by deed,
is abolished.
An instrument shall not be a deed unless—
(a)
(b)
(i)
(ii)
(2A)
(3)
(a)
(i)
(ii)
(b)
(4)
(a)
(b)
(4A)
it makes it clear on its face that it is intended to be a deed by the person making it or, as the case
may be, by the parties to it (whether by describing itself as a deed or expressing itself to be
executed or signed as a deed or otherwise); and
it is validly executed as a deed—
by that person or a person authorised to execute it in the name or on behalf of that person,
or
by one or more of those parties or a person authorised to execute it in the name or on
behalf of one or more of those parties.
For the purposes of subsection 2(a) above, an instrument shall not be taken to make it clear on its face
that it is intended to be a deed merely because it is executed under seal.
An instrument is validly executed as a deed by an individual if, and only if—
it is signed—
by him in the presence of a witness who attests the signature; or
at his direction and in his presence and the presence of two witnesses who each attest the
signature; and
it is delivered as a deed.
In subsections (2) and (3) above ‘sign’, in relation to an instrument, includes—
an individual signing the name of the person or party on whose behalf he executes the
instrument; and
making one’s mark on the instrument, and ‘signature’ is to be construed accordingly.
Subsection (3) above applies in the case of an instrument executed by an individual in the name or on
behalf of another person whether or not that person is also an individual.
The principal requirements that must be complied with if a deed is to be validly
executed are set out in subsections (2) and (3). Most of them, such as signature and
attestation, are relatively straightforward. The only requirement that requires some
elaboration is the concept of ‘delivery’ as found in section 1(3)(b). In 
Vincent
 
v. 
Premo
Enterprises (Voucher Sales) Ltd
 
[1969] 2 QB 609, 619 Lord Denning stated that:
‘[d]elivery’ in this connection does not mean ‘handed over’ to the other side. It means delivered in the old legal
sense, namely, an act done so as to evince an intention to be bound. Even though the deed remains in the
possession of the maker, or of his solicitor, he is bound by it if he has done some act evincing an intention to be
bound, as by saying: ‘I deliver this my act and deed’.
Deeds have an important role to play in legal practice. They provide a relatively simple
means by which a unilateral gratuitous promise can be rendered binding. Take the
example of a company that wishes to provide financial support to a university in order to
fund a university lectureship. The company may be unwilling to pay all the money up
front: it would rather pay an annual sum to the university over a fixed period of time.
(1)
(2)
But the university will want to know that the money will be paid as a matter of legal
obligation before it commits itself to employing a new member of staff in reliance upon
the promise of payment. The simplest way to make the promise binding is to use a deed
in which the company will undertake to pay a stipulated sum of money to the university
for a defined period of time. The other circumstance in which deeds play an important
role is where there is doubt about whether or not consideration has been provided for a
particular promise. Rather than invite litigation over whether or not consideration has
been provided, the parties may choose to eliminate the doubt by including the promise
in a deed, thus rendering it binding.
6.3.2
 
Formal Requirements Which Are Necessary
in Order to Render a Contract Binding
The second group of cases differs from the first in that the formal requirement does not
suffice to render the promise binding. In these cases the formal requirement is an
additional
, 
necessary
 
pre-requisite that must be satisfied if the contract is to be binding.
Thus the parties must show that there has been an offer, acceptance, consideration, and
intention to create legal relations in the usual way and, in addition, they must
demonstrate that the formal requirement has been satisfied. The formal requirement
may take different forms: it may be that the contract must be (i) made in writing, (ii)
evidenced in writing, or (iii) made by deed. Brief consideration will be given to these
three different formal requirements, to the consequences that may flow from a failure to
comply with them, and to the problems to which these requirements have given rise.
6.3.2.1
 
Contracts Which Must Be Made in Writing
An example of a contract that must be made in writing is a contract for the sale or
disposition of an interest in land. Section 2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1989 provides:
A contract for the sale or other disposition of an interest in land can only be made in writing and only by
incorporating all the terms which the parties have expressly agreed in one document or, where contracts
are exchanged, in each.
The terms may be incorporated in a document either by being set out in it or by reference to some other
document.
(3)
(4)
(5)
(a)
(b)
(c)
(6)
(7)
(8)
The document incorporating the terms or, where contracts are exchanged, one of the documents
incorporating them (but not necessarily the same one) must be signed by or on behalf of each party to
the contract.
Where a contract for the sale or other disposition of an interest in land satisfies the conditions of this
section by reason only of the rectification of one or more documents in pursuance of an order of a court,
the contract shall come into being, or be deemed to have come into being, at such time as may be
specified in the order.
This section does not apply in relation to—
a contract to grant such a lease as is mentioned in section 54(2) of the Law of Property Act 1925
(short leases);
a contract made in the course of a public auction; or
a contract regulated under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, other than a regulated
mortgage contract, a regulated home reversion plan, a regulated home purchase plan or a
regulated sale and rent back agreement;
and nothing in this section affects the creation or operation of resulting, implied or constructive trusts.
In this section— ‘disposition’ has the same meaning as in the Law of Property Act 1925; ‘interest in land’
means any estate, interest or charge in or over land.
Nothing in this section shall apply in relation to contracts made before this section comes into force.
Section 40 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (which is superseded by this section) shall cease to have
effect.
Section 2 applies only to executory contracts for the future sale or other disposition of an
interest in land and does not apply to an agreement which itself effects such a
disposition (
Rollerteam Ltd
 
v. 
Riley
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 1291, [2017] Ch 109). The section
has generated a considerable amount of litigation in its relatively short lifetime as
parties who have failed, for one reason or another, to comply with its requirements have
sought to escape from the consequences of non-compliance. In general, the courts have
not been sympathetic to their plight. The reason for this is that the courts have
discerned in section 2 an intention by Parliament to ‘introduce new and strict
requirements as to the formalities to be observed for the creation of a valid disposition
of an interest in land’ (per Neill LJ in 
McCausland
 
v. 
Duncan Lawrie Ltd
 
[1997] 1 WLR
38, 44).
This strict approach has been most apparent in the case where there has been a failure
to comply with the requirements of section 2. It has been less apparent where the issue
before the court is whether or not the requirements of section 2 have been satisfied. In
the latter context Briggs J stated in 
North Eastern Properties
 
v. 
Coleman
 
[2010] EWCA
Civ 277, [2010] 1 WLR 2715, [42] that it was ‘no part of Parliament’s intention by
enacting s 2 of the 1989 Act to make it easier for people who have genuinely contracted
to escape their contractual obligations’. Thus a court may be willing to adopt a
construction of section 2 which enables it to conclude that its requirements have been
satisfied and thereby ‘prevent or mitigate the injustice of enabling genuine contracting
parties to escape from their obligations’ (
North Eastern Properties
, [45]).
Section 2 is stricter than its statutory predecessor, section 40 of the Law of Property Act
1925, in a number of respects. First, section 40 only required that the contract be
evidenced in writing, whereas section 2 requires that the contract be ‘made’ in writing
(section 2(1)). Secondly, non-compliance with section 40 did not render the contract
void
 
but only unenforceable,
 
whereas an agreement which does not comply with
section 2 is a nullity (this is not expressly stated in section 2(1) but, given that the
subsection states that the contract must be made in writing, it follows that a contract
that does not comply with this requirement is ineffective as a matter of law). Thirdly,
under section 40 the written evidence could be contained in more than one document,
whereas under section 2(1) only one document is allowed. Fourthly, section 40 did not
require the memorandum or note to contain every term of the contract, whereas section
2(1) requires that all the terms must be contained in the document in question (unless
the parties enter into a genuine composite transaction which includes a land contract
where the land contract is genuinely separated from the rest of the transaction in the
sense that its performance is not made conditional upon the performance of some other
expressly agreed part of the bargain: 
North Eastern Properties
 
v. 
Coleman
 
[2010]
EWCA Civ 277, [2010] 1 WLR 2715). Finally, section 40(2) of the Law of Property Act
1925 preserved a role for the doctrine of part performance which was used by the courts
in order to mitigate the hardships that would otherwise flow from the conclusion that
the contract was unenforceable. The essence of the doctrine of part performance was
that in the case where, in the expectation that the defendant would perform its part of
the bargain, a claimant partly performed an oral contract required by statute to be in
writing, the court would not permit the defendant to invoke the statute in order to
prevent the claimant from enforcing the contract.
The doctrine of part performance has not survived the enactment of section 2 (section
2(8)). In 
Keay
 
v. 
Morris Homes (West Midlands) Ltd
 
[2012] EWCA Civ 900, [2012] 1
WLR 2855, [47] the Court of Appeal affirmed that a void contract cannot, by acts in the
nature 
of part performance, mature into a valid contract. This further evidences the fact
that the pendulum has swung away from the prevention of hardship in favour of the
promotion of certainty. But do the courts have at their disposal any techniques that they
1
2
can employ in order to prevent section 2 giving rise to undue hardship?
The answer to this question is to be found in large part in section 2(5) which expressly
preserves a role for resulting, implied, and constructive trusts.
 
While this subsection
expressly preserves a role for the constructive trust (on which see 
Matchmove Ltd
 
v.
Dowding and Church
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 1233, [2017] 1 WLR 749), there is greater doubt
whether proprietary estoppel (on which see 
5.3.4
) has any role to play in this context. In
Yeoman’s Row Management Ltd
 
v. 
Cobbe
 
[2008] UKHL 55, [2008] 1 WLR 1752 Lord
Scott answered this question in the negative when he stated (at [29]):
Subsection (5) expressly makes an exception for resulting, implied or constructive trusts. These may validly
come into existence without compliance with the prescribed formalities. Proprietary estoppel does not have the
benefit of this exception. The question arises, therefore, whether a complete agreement for the acquisition of an
interest in land that does not comply with the section 2 prescribed formalities, but would be specifically
enforceable if it did, can become enforceable via the route of proprietary estoppel. It is not necessary in the
present case to answer this question … My present view, however, is that proprietary estoppel cannot be prayed
in aid in order to render enforceable an agreement that statute has declared to be void. The proposition that an
owner of land can be estopped from asserting that an agreement is void for want of compliance with the
requirements of section 2 is, in my opinion, unacceptable. The assertion is no more than the statute provides.
Equity can surely not contradict the statute.
However, his statement (which was 
obiter
) cannot be regarded as the last word on the
issue. Lord Walker (at [93]) in 
Cobbe
 
expressly reserved his view on the scope of section
2 and Lord Neuberger returned to the issue in his speech in 
Thorner
 
v. 
Major
 
[2009]
UKHL 18, [2009] 1 WLR 776 when he stated (at [99]) that:
section 2 may have presented Mr Cobbe with a problem, as he was seeking to invoke an estoppel to protect a
right which was, in a sense, contractual in nature … and section 2 lays down formalities which are required for a
valid ‘agreement’ relating to land. However, at least as at present advised, I do not consider that section 2 has
any impact on a claim such as the present, which is a straightforward estoppel claim without any contractual
connection.
It would be premature to conclude that proprietary estoppel can have no role to play in
these cases (see 
Kinnear
 
v. 
Whittaker
 
[2011] EWHC 1479 (QB), [2011] All ER (D) 78
(Jun), [30]) but it seems unlikely that it will have a role to play where the parties have
not implemented their intention to make a formal document setting out the terms on
which one party is to acquire an interest in property, they have failed to reach agreement
with sufficient clarity on the property to be acquired, or they did not expect their
agreement to be immediately binding (
Herbert
 
v. 
Doyle
 
[2010] EWCA Civ 1095, (2010)
13 ITELR 561, [57]). This relative lack of clarity is regrettable and runs counter to one of
3
the principal purposes of section 2 which is to promote certainty in conveyancing
transactions. However, the fact that section 
2(5) expressly reserves a role for the
constructive trust demonstrates that the statutory commitment to the cause of certainty
is not unlimited. It is limited by the desire to prevent section 2 being used as a cloak for
unconscionable conduct or fraud. So, in an extreme case, where one party has
encouraged another to act to her (considerable) detriment in the belief that she has a
beneficial interest in the land, the court may be able to recognize the existence of a
beneficial interest notwithstanding the fact that the requirements of section 2(1) have
not been satisfied (see, for example, 
Yaxley
 
v. 
Gotts
 
[2000] Ch 162). But such cases are
very much the exception, not the rule. As Robert Walker LJ observed in 
Yaxley
, the
courts have discerned in section 2:
Parliament’s conclusion, in the general public interest, that the need for certainty as to the formation of
contracts of this type must 
in general
 
outweigh the disappointment of those who make informal bargains in
ignorance of the statutory requirement. If an estoppel would have the effect of enforcing a void contract and
subverting Parliament’s purpose it may have to yield to the statutory law which confronts it, except so far as the
statute’s saving for a constructive trust provides a means of reconciliation of the apparent conflict. [Emphasis
added.]
However, it should not be thought that such a strict approach is an inevitable
consequence of a statutory requirement that a contract be made in writing. The strict
approach to the interpretation of section 2 is a product of the policy that underpins the
section. But the aim of a statute may not be to promote certainty; it may be to protect
one party to the transaction. An example in the latter category is provided by the
Consumer Credit Act 1974, section 61(1) of which states that a ‘regulated agreement’ is
not ‘properly executed’ unless it complies with the requirements of sections 60 and 61.
In this instance the consequence of non-compliance is not inevitable nullity because
such a conclusion would frustrate the policy behind the legislation. The aim of the Act is
to protect the consumer and this is reflected in section 65(1) which states that ‘an
improperly-executed regulated agreement is enforceable 
against the debtor or hirer
 
on
an order of the court only’ (emphasis added). The court is thus interposed as the
protector of the consumer. The jurisdiction of the court to make an enforcement order
notwithstanding the fact that the agreement has been improperly executed is regulated
by section 127 of the Act, which gives to the court a discretion to make an enforcement
order notwithstanding the infringement.
6.3.2.2
 
Contracts Which Must Be Evidenced in Writing
Secondly, the law may state that the contract must be 
evidenced
 
in writing (rather than
made in writing). An example in this category is provided by section 4 of the Statute of
Frauds 1677 which states:
Noe action shall be brought … whereby to charge the defendant upon any speciall promise to answere for the
debt default or miscarriages of another person … unlesse the agreement upon which such action shall be
brought or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writeing and signed by the partie to be charged
therewith or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.
Section 4 is another provision that has given rise to a substantial amount of litigation. In
many ways it is the classic illustration of the problems that can arise in terms of
identifying the type of contract that should be the subject of the formal requirement. The
critical phrase 
when determining the scope of the section is ‘debt, default or
miscarriages of another person’. Thus the section applies only where a primary liability
has been assumed by ‘another person’ and the defendant has assumed a secondary
liability to answer for that debt (a secondary liability is a liability that arises upon default
by the debtor of a primary obligation). If the defendant’s liability proves to be primary
rather than secondary in character, section 4 will not be applicable. The problem is that
it can, in some cases, be difficult to tell whether the liability that has been assumed by
the defendant is primary or secondary in nature. The courts have in fact experienced
considerable difficulty in deciding whether the liability of the defendant is secondary (a
guarantee) or primary (an indemnity). Indeed the difficulty in drawing this distinction
once led Harman LJ to state that this ‘barren controversy’ has ‘raised many hair-
splitting distinctions of exactly that kind which brings the law into hatred, ridicule and
contempt by the public’ (
Yeoman Credit Ltd
 
v. 
Latter
 
[1961] 1 WLR 828, 835).
The effect of non-compliance with section 4 is to render the contract unenforceable. In
Actionstrength Ltd
 
v. 
International Glass Engineering IN.GL.EN SpA
 
[2003] UKHL 17,
[2003] 2 AC 541 sub-contractors on a construction project threatened to withdraw their
labour because they were not being paid for their work by the main contractor
(notwithstanding the fact that the main contractor had been paid by the employer). The
sub-contractors withdrew this threat after reaching an oral agreement with the
employer under which the employer agreed to ensure that the sub-contractors received
the sums due to them by the main contractor and that, if necessary, the employer would
do this by making payments directly to the sub-contractors rather than to the main
contractor. The sub-contractors returned to work but the main contractor’s
indebtedness to them continued to increase until it reached £1.3 million. It being clear
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
that the main contractor was unable to pay this amount, the sub-contractors brought a
claim against the employer. The employer argued that its promise to pay was
unenforceable on the ground that it did not satisfy the requirements of section 4. The
sub-contractors argued that the agreement did not fall within the scope of section 4 but
this submission was rejected. It was held that the employer’s liability was secondary in
nature rather than primary so that it fell within the scope of section 4 and, being an oral
promise that was not evidenced in writing, it was not enforceable. Further, it was held
that the employers were not estopped from invoking section 4 in order to deny the
efficacy of the promise made. On the facts the only assurance given by the employers to
the sub-contractors was the oral promise itself (which was unenforceable) and this was
held to be insufficient to give rise to an estoppel. The House of Lords did not conclude
that estoppel can never be invoked in order to prevent reliance upon the Statute of
Frauds. But they stated that ‘something more’ was required than reliance upon the
unenforceable promise itself. The precise nature of that ‘something more’ was not
established but it is likely to take the form of an express assurance that reliance will not
be placed upon the Statute of Frauds.
Actionstrength
 
therefore illustrates the serious consequences that can flow from a
failure to comply with formal requirements. The decision must have caused significant
hardship to the sub-contractors in that they were left with no enforceable claim against
the employer and a worthless claim for £1.3 million against the main contractor who
was in liquidation. This point was noted by their Lordships. Thus Lord Woolf stated that
he reached the decision to dismiss the appeal with ‘regret’. Lord Bingham was more
forthright. He stated:
6. While section 4 of the Statute of Frauds has been repealed or replaced in its application to the other four
classes of contract originally specified, it has been retained in relation to guarantees. In 1937 the Law Revision
Committee (in its Sixth Interim Report, 
Statute of Frauds 
and the Doctrine of Consideration
, Cmd 5449,
paragraph 16) recommended the repeal of so much as remained of section 4. But a minority headed by Goddard
J dissented in relation to guarantees, on the grounds
that there was a real danger of inexperienced people being led into undertaking obligations which they
did not fully understand, and that opportunities would be given to the unscrupulous to assert that credit
was given on the faith of a guarantee which the alleged surety had had no intention of giving;
that a guarantee was a special class of contract, being generally one-sided and disinterested as far as the
surety was concerned, and the necessity of writing would give the proposed surety an opportunity for
thought;
that the requirement of writing would ensure that the terms of the guarantee were settled and recorded;
that Parliament had imposed a requirement of writing in other contractual contexts;
(5)
(6)
(7)
that judges and juries were not infallible on questions of fact, and in the vast majority of cases the surety
was getting nothing out of the bargain;
that it was desirable to protect the small man; and
that the necessity for guarantees to be in writing was generally understood.
No action was taken on the 1937 report. In 1953 the Law Reform Committee (First Report, 
Statute of Frauds
and Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893
, Cmd 8809) endorsed the recommendation of its predecessor that
section 4 of the Statute of Frauds should be largely repealed but, agreeing with those who had earlier dissented,
unanimously recommended that the section should continue to apply to guarantees. Effect was given to this
report by enactment of the 1954 Act. Whatever the strength of the reasons given … for retaining the old rule in
relation to conventional consumer guarantees, it will be apparent that those reasons have little bearing on cases
where the facts are such as those to be assumed here. It was not a bargain struck between inexperienced people,
liable to misunderstand what they were doing. St-Gobain [the employers], as surety, had a very clear incentive
to keep the Actionstrength workforce on site and, on the assumed facts, had an opportunity to think again.
There is assumed to be no issue about the terms of the guarantee. English contract law does not ordinarily
require writing as a condition of enforceability. It is not obvious why judges are more fallible when ruling on
guarantees than other forms of oral contract. These were not small men in need of paternalist protection. While
the familiar form of bank guarantee is well understood, it must be at least doubtful whether those who made the
assumed agreement in this case appreciated that it was in law a guarantee. The judge at first instance was
doubtful whether it was or not. The Court of Appeal reached the view that it was, but regarded the point as
interesting and not entirely easy … Two members of the court discussed the question at a little length, with
detailed reference to authority.
7.
 
It may be questionable whether, in relation to contracts of guarantee, the mischief at which section 4 was
originally aimed, is not now outweighed, at least in some classes of case, by the mischief to which it can give rise
in a case such as the present, however unusual such cases may be. But that is not a question for the House in its
judicial capacity. Sitting judicially, the House must of course give effect to the law of the land of which (in
England and Wales) section 4 is part.
Reform of the law is therefore a matter for Parliament, not the judges.
6.3.2.3
 
Contracts Which Must Be Made by Deed
Thirdly, the law may state that the contract must be made by deed. This is an
exceptional requirement and it is now confined to conveyancing transactions. Thus
section 52(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 provides:
All conveyances of land or of any interest therein are void for the purpose of conveying or creating a legal estate
unless made by deed.
Section 52(2) provides for a number of exceptions to the requirement laid down in
section 52(1). One of these exceptions is a lease for a term not exceeding three years (see
section 52(2)(d) and section 54(2)).
 
A contract which is void has, in general, no legal effect.
 
A contract which is unenforceable is valid in all respects except that it cannot be enforced by one or other party
(possibly, both).
 
A constructive trust is generally regarded as a trust that is imposed by law, whereas a resulting trust is a trust where
the beneficial interest jumps back, or returns, to the settlor. See further A Burrows (ed), 
English Private Law
 
(3rd
edn, Oxford University Press, 2013), paras 4.159–4.161.

The Future of Formal Requirements
Requirements of form are likely to continue to play a prominent role in transactions
involving consumers. In the commercial sphere it is unlikely that there will be a further
significant role for requirements of form. The nature of formal requirements will also
have to be given further thought. This is true both for consumer and for commercial
contracts given the increasing use of electronic means of communication. European law
has played an important role in encouraging legal systems to adapt to the changing
nature of formal requirements. For example, Article 9(1) of the EC Directive on
Electronic Commerce (2000/31/EC) states that:
Member States shall ensure that their legal system allows contracts to be concluded by electronic means.
Member States shall in particular ensure that the legal requirements applicable to the contractual process
neither create obstacles for the use of electronic contracts nor result in such contracts being deprived of legal
effectiveness and validity on account of their being made by electronic means.
Article 2(i) of the Electronic Identification and Trust Services (eIDAS) Regulation
910/2014 (which continues to be applicable within the UK after our departure from the
EU) defines an electronic signature as ‘data in electronic form which are attached to or
logically associated with other electronic data and which serves as a method of
authentication’.
Section 8 of the Electronic Communications Act 2000 gives to Ministers the authority to
review statutes and related legislation that require documents to be in writing and to
amend them by way of secondary legislation ‘in such manner as [the Minister] may
think fit for the purpose of authorising or facilitating the use of electronic
communications or electronic storage’. Further, section 91(4) of the Land Registration
Act 2002 provides that a document properly made in electronic form is to be treated as
if it were in writing and properly executed, while section 91(5) further provides that a
document properly made in electronic form is to be regarded ‘for the purposes of any
enactment as a deed’. The section thus paves the way for the introduction of electronic
conveyancing. Gradually, we can expect to see further modifications to existing
legislation to reflect the fact that, in the modern world, requirements of form can be
satisfied by electronic means in addition to more traditional formal requirements, such
as writing.
However, it may not be necessary to pass legislation in order to reflect the changing
nature of modern communications. Judges may be able to do this through the normal
process of interpreting existing legislation. Thus in 
J Pereira Fernandes SA
 
v. 
Mehta
[2006] EWHC 813 (Ch), [2006] 1 WLR 1543, Judge Pelling QC held that an offer sent by
email satisfied the requirements of ‘writing’ in section 4 of the Statute of Frauds and
that, when deciding whether or not an email has been ‘signed’, the same approach
should be taken as would be adopted when deciding whether a hard copy of the same
document had been signed (see also 
Neocleous
 
v. 
Rees
 
[2019] EWHC 2462 (Ch), [2020]
2 P & CR 4).

Intention to Create Legal Relations
Central Issues
In order to create a valid and binding contract the parties must have
had an intention to create legal relations. This rule does not generally
give rise to any difficulties in the context of commercial transactions
because the courts presume that parties to a commercial agreement
do intend to create legal relations. The presumption is not an
irrebuttable one but it is not an easy one to rebut.
The doctrine of intention to create legal relations plays its most
important role in the context of domestic and social agreements. In
both contexts the courts presume that the parties to the agreement did
not intend to create legal relations. Once again, this presumption is
not an irrebuttable one and the factors relied upon by the courts in
order to rebut the presumption are considered in this chapter.
It is important to consider the basis of this doctrine. Does it rest on the
intention of the parties or is it based on a rule of law or public policy?
It will be suggested that the initial presumption rests on a rule of law
or public policy and that the intention of the parties is relevant to the
rebuttal of that presumption. The policy that is articulated in the
presumption is that the law should, in general, keep out of the
regulation of domestic and social agreements.
But this leads on to another, more difficult question and that relates to
the role of the presumptions and the doctrine of intention to create
legal relations more generally. Should the law of contract continue to
keep out of family life or is the presumption that the parties to
domestic agreements do not intend to create legal relations one that is
out of step with modern family life?

Introduction
A further essential ingredient of a binding contract is that the parties must have had an
intention to create legal relations. In other words, they must have had an intention to be
bound by the terms of their agreement. The doctrine of intention to create legal relations
is a 
relatively late arrival in English contract law. As has already been noted (see 
3.2.1
),
Professor Simpson gives the credit for the first recognition of the doctrine to the Court of
Appeal in 
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic Smoke Ball Co Ltd
 
[1893] 2 QB 256. It was not, however,
until the judgment of Atkin LJ in 
Balfour
 
v. 
Balfour
 
[1919] 2 KB 571 (
7.2
) that its place
was firmly established in English contract law.
The impact of this doctrine is greatest outside the sphere of commercial transactions. In
the case of ordinary commercial transactions the law presumes that the parties did
intend to create legal relations. The presumption that the parties to a commercial
transaction intended to create legal relations is not an irrebuttable one. It can be
rebutted but clear evidence is required in order to do so (
Edwards
 
v. 
Skyways Ltd
[1964] 1 WLR 349, 355). The picture is otherwise when we turn to domestic and social
agreements. In these contexts the presumption operates the other way. The
presumption is that the parties to domestic and social agreements do not intend to
create legal relations. This presumption is not as difficult to rebut as the presumption in
favour of intention to create legal relations in the context of commercial transactions.
But evidence must be led in order to establish that the parties did in fact intend to create
legal relations.
The intention of the parties is judged objectively and not by inquiring into their
respective states of mind (see 
Maple Leaf Marco Volatility Master Fund
 
v. 
Rouvroy
[2009] EWCA Civ 1334, [2010] 2 All ER (Comm) 788, [17] and, more generally, 
Chapter
2
). However, in the case where a party in fact knows that the other party does not intend
to create legal relations, he is not entitled to assert that the parties did intend to create
legal relations by submitting that, objectively, the evidence supports the conclusion that
the parties did intend to create legal relations. Just as a party cannot ‘snap up’ an offer
he knew was not intended (see 
2.3
), so a party who actually knows that there was no
intention to create legal relations cannot maintain that, objectively, there was such an
intention (
Attrill
 
v. 
Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 394, [2013] 3 All ER 607,
[86]).
We shall start by considering cases concerned with agreements made in a domestic and
a social context before turning to analyse the role of intention to create legal relations in
the commercial environment.
7.2
 
Domestic Agreements
In the case of agreements entered into in a domestic context the presumption is that the
parties did not intend to create legal relations. The leading case is:
BALFOUR V. BALFOUR
[1919] 2 KB 571, Court of Appeal
The defendant and plaintiff were husband and wife. They were married in 1900
and went to live in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). They returned to England in 1915 when
the defendant (the husband) had some leave from his work. When his leave came
to an end he returned to Ceylon but his wife remained in England, on the advice of
her doctor. Shortly before the defendant set sail for Ceylon in August 1916 the
plaintiff alleged that they made an oral agreement, according to which he promised
to pay her £30 per month until she returned to Ceylon. Differences then arose
between them and the defendant wrote to the plaintiff 
suggesting that they should
live apart. The plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings in 1918 and she obtained
an order for alimony.
In the present proceedings the plaintiff sought to enforce the alleged agreement
by which the defendant had promised to pay her £30 per month. The first instance
judge, Sargant J, held that the defendant was under an obligation to support his
wife and that effect should be given to the agreement reached by the parties. The
defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal. His appeal was allowed and it was
held that he was not liable to make the promised payments to the plaintiff.
Warrington LJ
[set out the facts and continued]
Those being the facts we have to say whether there is a legal contract between
the parties, in other words, whether what took place between them was in the
domain of a contract or whether it was merely a domestic arrangement such as
may be made every day between a husband and wife who are living together in
friendly intercourse. It may be, and I do not for a moment say that it is not, possible
for such a contract as is alleged in the present case to be made between husband
and wife. The question is whether such a contract was made. That can only be
determined either by proving that it was made in express terms, or that there is a
necessary implication from the circumstances of the parties, and the transaction
generally, that such a contract was made. It is quite plain that no such contract was
made in express terms, and there was no bargain on the part of the wife at all. All
that took place was this: The husband and wife met in a friendly way and
discussed what would be necessary for her support while she was detained in
England, the husband being in Ceylon, and they came to the conclusion that £30 a
month would be about right, but there is no evidence of any express bargain by the
wife that she would in all the circumstances treat that as in satisfaction of the
obligation of the husband to maintain her. Can we find a contract from the position
of the parties? It seems to me it is quite impossible. If we were to imply such a
contract in this case we should be implying on the part of the wife that whatever
happened and whatever might be the change of circumstances while the husband
was away she should be content with this £30 a month, and bind herself by an
obligation in law not to require him to pay anything more; and on the other hand we
should be implying on the part of the husband a bargain to pay £30 a month for
some indefinite period whatever might be his circumstances. Then again it seems
to me that it would be impossible to make any such implication. The matter really
reduces itself to an absurdity when one considers it, because if we were to hold
that there was a contract in this case we should have to hold that with regard to all
the more or less trivial concerns of life where a wife, at the request of her husband,
makes a promise to him, that is a promise which can be enforced in law. All I can
say is that there is no such contract here. These two people never intended to
make a bargain which could be enforced in law. The husband expressed his
intention to make this payment, and he promised to make it, and was bound in
honour to continue it so long as he was in a position to do so. The wife on the other
hand, so far as I can see, made no bargain at all. That is in my opinion sufficient to
dispose of the case …
I think the judgment of Sargant J cannot stand, the appeal ought to be allowed
and judgment ought to be entered for the defendant.
Duke LJ
I agree. This is in some respects an important case, and as we differ from the
judgment of the Court below I propose to state concisely my views and the
grounds which have led me to the conclusion at which I have arrived. Substantially
the question is whether the promise 
of the husband to the wife that while she is
living absent from him he will make her a periodical allowance involves in law a
consideration on the part of the wife sufficient to convert that promise into a binding
agreement. In my opinion it does not. I do not dissent, as at present advised, from
the proposition that the spouses in this case might have made an agreement which
would have given the plaintiff a cause of action. … But we have to see whether
there is evidence of any such exchange of promises as would make the promise of
the husband the basis of an agreement. It was strongly urged by [counsel for the
plaintiff] that the promise being absolute in form ought to be construed as one of
the mutual promises which make an agreement. It was said that a promise and an
implied undertaking between strangers, such as the promise and implied
undertaking alleged in this case would have founded an action on contract. That
may be so, but it is impossible to disregard in this case what was the basis of the
whole communications between the parties under which the alleged contract is
said to have been formed. The basis of their communications was their relationship
of husband and wife, a relationship which creates certain obligations, but not that
which is here put in suit. There was a discussion between the parties while they
were absent from one another, whether they should agree upon a separation. In
the Court below the plaintiff conceded that down to the time of her suing in the
Divorce Division there was no separation, and that the period of absence was a
period of absence as between husband and wife living in amity. An agreement for
separation when it is established does involve mutual considerations …
But in this case there was no separation agreement at all. The parties were
husband and wife, and subject to all the conditions, in point of law, involved in that
relationship. It is impossible to say that where the relationship of husband and wife
exists, and promises are exchanged, they must be deemed to be promises of a
contractual nature. In order to establish a contract there ought to be something
more than mere mutual promises having regard to the domestic relations of the
parties. It is required that the obligations arising out of that relationship shall be
displaced before either of the parties can found a contract upon such promises.
The formula which was stated in this case to support the claim of the lady was this:
In consideration that you will agree to give me £30 a month I will agree to forego
my right to pledge your credit. … What is said on the part of the wife in this case is
that her arrangement with her husband that she should assent to that which was in
his discretion to do or not to do was the consideration moving from her to her
husband. The giving up of that which was not a right was not a consideration. The
proposition that the mutual promises made in the ordinary domestic relationship of
husband and wife of necessity give cause for action on a contract seems to me to
go to the very root of the relationship, and to be a possible fruitful source of
dissension and quarrelling. I cannot see that any benefit would result from it to
either of the parties, but on the other hand it would lead to unlimited litigation in a
relationship which should be obviously as far as possible protected from
possibilities of that kind. I think, therefore, that in point of principle there is no
foundation for the claim which is made here, and I am satisfied that there was no
consideration moving from the wife to the husband or promise by the husband to
the wife which was sufficient to sustain this action founded on contract. I think,
therefore, that the appeal must be allowed.
Atkin LJ
The defence to this action on the alleged contract is that the defendant, the
husband, entered into no contract with his wife, and for the determination of that it
is necessary to remember that there are agreements between parties which do not
result in contracts within the meaning of that term in our law. The ordinary example
is where two parties agree to 
take a walk together, or where there is an offer and
an acceptance of hospitality. Nobody would suggest in ordinary circumstances that
those agreements result in what we know as a contract, and one of the most usual
forms of agreement which does not constitute a contract appears to me to be the
arrangements which are made between husband and wife. It is quite common, and
it is the natural and inevitable result of the relationship of husband and wife, that
the two spouses should make arrangements between themselves—agreements
such as are in dispute in this action—agreements for allowances, by which the
husband agrees that he will pay to his wife a certain sum of money, per week, or
per month, or per year, to cover either her own expenses or the necessary
expenses of the household and of the children of the marriage, and in which the
wife promises either expressly or impliedly to apply the allowance for the purpose
for which it is given. To my mind those agreements, or many of them, do not result
in contracts at all, and they do not result in contracts even though there may be
what as between other parties would constitute consideration for the agreement.
The consideration, as we know, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or
benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility
given, suffered or undertaken by the other. That is a well-known definition, and it
constantly happens, I think, that such arrangements made between husband and
wife are arrangements in which there are mutual promises, or in which there is
consideration in form within the definition that I have mentioned. Nevertheless they
are not contracts, and they are not contracts because the parties did not intend
that they should be attended by legal consequences. To my mind it would be of the
worst possible example to hold that agreements such as this resulted in legal
obligations which could be enforced in the Courts. It would mean this, that when
the husband makes his wife a promise to give her an allowance of 30s. or £2 a
week, whatever he can afford to give her, for the maintenance of the household
and children, and she promises so to apply it, not only could she sue him for his
failure in any week to supply the allowance, but he could sue her for
nonperformance of the obligation, express or implied, which she had undertaken
upon her part. All I can say is that the small Courts of this country would have to be
multiplied one hundredfold if these arrangements were held to result in legal
obligations. They are not sued upon, not because the parties are reluctant to
enforce their legal rights when the agreement is broken, but because the parties, in
the inception of the arrangement, never intended that they should be sued upon.
Agreements such as these are outside the realm of contracts altogether. The
common law does not regulate the form of agreements between spouses. Their
promises are not sealed with seals and sealing wax. The consideration that really
obtains for them is that natural love and affection which counts for so little in these
cold Courts. The terms may be repudiated, varied or renewed as performance
proceeds or as disagreements develop, and the principles of the common law as
to exoneration and discharge and accord and satisfaction are such as find no
place in the domestic code. The parties themselves are advocates, judges, Courts,
sheriff’s officer and reporter. In respect of these promises each house is a domain
into which the King’s writ does not seek to run, and to which his officers do not
seek to be admitted. The only question in this case is whether or not this promise
was of such a class or not. For the reasons given by my brethren it appears to me
to be plainly established that the promise here was not intended by either party to
be attended by legal consequences. I think the onus was upon the plaintiff, and the
plaintiff has not established any contract. The parties were living together, the wife
intending to return. The suggestion is that the husband bound himself to pay £30 a
month under all circumstances, and she bound herself to be satisfied with that sum
under all circumstances, and, although she was in ill-health and alone in this
country, that out of that sum she undertook to defray the whole of the medical
expenses that might fall upon her, whatever might be the development of her
illness, and 
in whatever expenses it might involve her. To my mind neither party
contemplated such a result. I think that the parol evidence upon which the case
turns does not establish a contract. I think that the letters do not evidence such a
contract, or amplify the oral evidence which was given by the wife, which is not in
dispute. For these reasons I think the judgment of the Court below was wrong and
that this appeal should be allowed.
Commentary
The judgment of Atkin LJ is the one that is most commonly quoted in the textbooks and
in subsequent cases. His judgment clearly recognizes the existence of the doctrine of
intention to create legal relations and he applies it to the facts of the case. The
judgments of Warrington and Duke LJJ are more equivocal. The central question for
Warrington LJ was whether or not it was possible to imply a contract on the facts of the
case and, while he made reference to the question of whether or not the parties intended
to make a bargain which could be enforced in law, he did not expressly articulate an
independent requirement that the parties must intend to create legal relations. The
judgment of Duke LJ seems to be based rather more on the doctrine of consideration. As
the law then stood, a wife had authority, under certain circumstances, to pledge her
husband’s credit for suitable necessaries. In essence this was the common law remedy
available to a wife who was not supported financially by her husband. Thus it was
argued on behalf of Mrs Balfour that she had supplied consideration for the promise to
pay her £30 a month by refraining from pledging her husband’s credit for necessaries.
However, Duke LJ held that she had not supplied consideration for her husband’s
promise. His reason for so concluding appears to have been simply that the parties were
still husband and wife at the time the promise was made and this brings us back to the
point that the reason for the failure of the claim is to be found in the fact that the parties
were husband and wife, and had not separated, at the time the promise was made.
This diversity in the reasoning of the court in 
Balfour
 
makes it difficult to discern the
precise 
ratio
 
of the case. That said, courts in subsequent cases have not been unduly
concerned by this point and have turned to the judgment of Atkin LJ for support for the
proposition that English law recognizes the existence of a doctrine of intention to create
legal relations. The existence of this doctrine is now clearly established by authority,
whatever doubts we may harbour about the 
ratio
 
of the case that is usually cited as the
origin of the doctrine in English law. We must now turn to consider the scope of the
presumption that parties to domestic agreements do not intend to create legal relations,
the factors that have been used by the courts in order to rebut the presumption, the
rationale of the presumption, and, finally, the relationship, in the domestic context,
between the doctrine of intention to create legal relations and the doctrine of
consideration.
7.2.1
 
The Scope of the Presumption
As 
Balfour
 
demonstrates, the presumption that parties to domestic agreements do not
intend to create legal relations is applicable as between husbands and wives, at least
where they have not separated and are living together ‘in amity’. The position is
otherwise where they have separated at the time at which the agreement is made. Thus
in 
Merritt
 
v. 
Merritt
 
[1970] 1 WLR 1211 the Court of Appeal held that an agreement
between a husband and wife who had separated was enforceable as a contract. Lord
Denning MR stated (at p. 1213):
I do not think that [
Balfour
 
v. 
Balfour
 
has] any application here. The parties there were living together in amity.
In such cases their domestic arrangements are ordinarily not intended to create legal relations. It is altogether
different when the parties are not living in amity but are separated, or about to separate. They then bargain
keenly. They do not rely on honourable understandings. They want everything cut and dried. It may safely be
presumed that they intend to create legal relations.
In this respect 
Balfour
 
may be thought to be close to the margins because the parties
agreed to separate shortly after Mr Balfour promised to pay £30 per month to Mrs
Balfour. But Duke LJ records in his judgment that Mrs Balfour conceded that there was
no separation at the time at which the agreement was made and that ‘the period of
absence was a period of absence as between husband and wife living in amity’. Had she
not made that concession and had there been evidence to prove that a separation was
imminent, 
Balfour
 
might have been decided differently (indeed in 
Pettitt
 
v. 
Pettitt
[1970] AC 777, 816 Lord Upjohn stated that the facts of 
Balfour
 
stretched the doctrine of
intention to create legal relations to ‘its limits’). It is unlikely that 
Balfour
 
only applies as
between married couples who are living together ‘in amity’. It must also apply by
analogy to parties who cohabit, whether or not they are married.
The presumption that parties to a domestic agreement do not intend to create legal
relations has also been applied to an agreement between a mother and her daughter. In
Jones
 
v. 
Padavatton
 
[1969] 1 WLR 328 a mother promised to maintain her daughter if
she gave up her job in Washington and went to London to read for the Bar with a view to
practising as a lawyer in Trinidad. The mother lived in Trinidad and her promise was
made in 1962. Initially, the promise took the form of a promise of a monthly allowance
but subsequently that arrangement was varied and the mother bought a house for her
daughter in 1964, on the understanding that the daughter could live there rent free, rent
out rooms in the house to lodgers, and use the rent to provide for her maintenance. The
daughter entered on her studies for the Bar in November 1962 but by November 1968,
the date of the hearing before the Court of Appeal, she had not completed the course
successfully (she had passed all but one of her Part I papers but had not yet embarked
upon Part II). In 1967 the mother issued a summons in which she claimed possession of
the house. The daughter resisted her attempt to do so on the ground that she had a
contractual entitlement to live in the house. The Court of Appeal held that the mother
was entitled to possession of the house. The reasons given for the rejection of the
daughter’s claim differed. Danckwerts LJ stated (at p. 332):
There is no doubt that this case is a most difficult one, but I have reached a conclusion that the present case is
one of those family arrangements which depend on the good faith of the promises which are made and are not
intended to be rigid, binding agreements. 
Balfour
 
v. 
Balfour
 
was a case of husband and wife, but there is no
doubt that the same principles apply to dealings between other relations, such as father and son and daughter
and mother. This, indeed, seems to me a compelling case. Mrs Jones and her daughter seem to have been on
very good terms before 1967. The mother was arranging for a career for her daughter which she hoped would
lead to success. This involved a visit to England in conditions which could not be wholly foreseen. What was
required was an arrangement which was to be financed by the mother, and was such as would be adaptable to
circumstances, as it in fact was. The operation about the house was, in my view, not a completely fresh
arrangement, but an adaptation of the mother’s financial assistance to the daughter due to the situation which
was found to exist in England. It was not a stiff contractual operation any more than the original arrangement.
Fenton-Atkinson LJ adopted a similar approach. In his view neither party intended to
enter into a contract at any stage in this saga: rather, they placed trust in one another to
honour their promises. Salmon LJ took a rather different view. He concluded that there
was, initially, a binding agreement between the mother and the daughter. Thus he stated
(at p. 333) that he could not think that ‘either intended that if, after the daughter had
been in London, say, for six months, the mother dishonoured her promise and left her
daughter destitute, the daughter would have no legal redress’. On the ‘very special
circumstances of this case’ he concluded that ‘the true inference must be that neither the
mother nor the daughter could have intended that the daughter should have no legal
right to receive, and the mother no legal obligation to pay, the allowance of $200 a
month’. But the problem which he identified was one relating to the certainty of the
agreement itself, particularly in relation to its duration. Thus he concluded (at p. 334)
that:
the promise was to pay the allowance until the daughter’s studies were completed, and to my mind there was a
clear implication that they were to be completed within a reasonable time. … It may not be easy to decide,
especially when there is such a paucity of evidence, what is a reasonable time. The daughter, however, was a
well educated intelligent woman capable of earning the equivalent of over £2,000 a year in Washington. It is
true that she had a young son to look after, and may well … have been hampered to some extent by the worry of
this litigation. But, making all allowances for these factors and any other distraction, I cannot think that a
reasonable time could possibly exceed five years from November 1962, the date when she began her studies.
Jones
 
v. 
Padavatton
 
is, in many ways, a difficult case. The daughter initially gave up a
great deal on the strength of her mother’s promise and that factor pointed in the
direction of the promise being legally enforceable. But, in the end, the Court of Appeal
concluded that that factor was outweighed by the presumption that the parties did not
intend to create legal relations combined with the vague terms in which the agreement
was expressed.
7.2.2
 
Rebutting the Presumption
The presumption that the parties to domestic agreements do not intend to create legal
relations can be rebutted in a number of different ways. There is no finite list of methods
by which the presumption can be rebutted.
While the question whether or not the presumption has been rebutted ultimately
depends upon the facts of the case, the cases in which the presumption has been
rebutted exhibit some common features. In the first place the context in which the
agreement was concluded has often been a factor in persuading the court to rebut the
presumption. For example, the presumption may be rebutted where a husband and wife
enter into an ‘agreement to share the ownership or tenancy of the matrimonial home,
bank accounts, savings or other assets’ (
Granatino
 
v. 
Radmacher
 
[2010] UKSC 42,
[2011] 1 AC 534, [142]). The presumption is, also, more likely to be rebutted in the case
where the relationship between the parties is approaching the point of break-down (see
Merritt
 
v. 
Merritt,
 
7.2.1
). Similarly, where the context in which the agreement is reached
is a commercial one, as in the example of an agreement made in connection with the
running of a family business, a court is more likely to conclude that the presumption has
been rebutted (see, for example, 
Snelling
 
v. 
John G Snelling Ltd
 
[1973] 1 QB 87).
Secondly, the presumption may be rebutted where the parties have acted to their
detriment in reliance upon the agreement that has been concluded between the parties.
This factor does not always suffice to rebut the presumption, as can be seen from 
Jones
v. 
Padavatton
 
(see 
7.2.1
). But cases can be found in which it has operated to rebut the
presumption. An example is 
Parker
 
v. 
Clark
 
[1960] 1 WLR 286. The plaintiffs, a married
couple, agreed to give up their own home in order to move in and share the home of the
defendants, an elderly couple. The parties reached an agreement under which they
agreed to share the household expenses and the defendants promised to leave the house
in their will for the benefit of the plaintiffs and their relatives. In reliance upon the
agreement, the plaintiffs sold their home and lent part of the proceeds to their daughter
in order to enable her to buy a flat. The plaintiffs moved into the defendants’ home in
March 1956 and they did most of the work around the house. However, the relationship
between the parties soon began to deteriorate and in December 1957 the plaintiffs, in
order to avoid being evicted, left the house. They brought an action for damages against
the defendants. One of the grounds on which the defendants denied that they were liable
to the plaintiffs was that the parties had not concluded a contract because they had no
intention to create legal relations. Devlin J concluded that there was a contract between
the parties and that the defendants were liable in damages to the plaintiffs. He stated:
I cannot believe … that the defendant really thought that the law would leave him at liberty, if he so chose, to tell
the plaintiffs when they arrived that he had changed his mind, that they could take their furniture away and that
he was indifferent whether they found anywhere else to live or not. Yet this is what the defence means. … I am
satisfied that an arrangement binding in law was intended by both parties.
However, the position may well have been different had the parties fallen out before the
plaintiffs acted to their detriment by selling the house and moving in with the
defendants. On such facts a court may well have concluded that the parties did not
intend to enter into a binding contract. This suggests that there may be a difference
between executed and executory agreements. In this context, consider the following
claim made by Professor Hedley (see S Hedley, ‘Keeping Contract in its Place: 
Balfour
 
v.
Balfour
 
and the Enforceability of Informal Agreements’ (1985) 5 
OJLS
 
391, 408):
The fallacy to be avoided … consists of asking the question ‘Is there a contract?’, but forgetting that a court is
almost invariably faced with a particular claim based on an alleged contract. The perspective given by the claim
made alters everything. Take a variation of the classic academic conundrum in this area: Jack and Jill agree to
go out to dinner and to split the bill. By asking the academic question ‘Is there a contract?’ we are immediately
in the realm of the abstract. If, however, we approach the matter from a practical standpoint, we must know
what claim is being made. If Jill is suing Jack because Jack has refused to go to dinner at all, the arguments
against liability are compelling. Surely, Jack cannot be taken as giving an outright commitment to go to dinner
—what if he is ill, or they cannot agree on a suitable restaurant? But imagine that the two already had their
dinner, for convenience Jill pays the bill in full, but Jack subsequently refuses to pay his half. The perspective
changes. It is no longer so obvious that the contract cannot be enforced. 
If it is the ‘reasonable man’ we are
consulting, then the ‘reasonable man’s’ opinion may change in the course of the transaction
. Jack’s contention
that there was no intention to form a binding contract is likely to receive little sympathy. 
Blanket statements in
cases that there is no ‘intention to contract’ on the facts before the court should therefore be treated with
suspicion; it is vital to note whether this was being said in relation to an executed or an executory contract.

7.2.3
 
The Rationale Behind the Presumption
What is the basis of the presumption that the parties to domestic agreements do not
intend to create legal relations? Is it to be found in the actual, albeit unexpressed,
intention of the parties or is its basis to be found in a rule of law or of public policy? The
judgment of Atkin LJ in 
Balfour
 
suggests that the initial presumption is derived from
the law (or, if one prefers, public policy) rather than the intention of the parties. The
reasons he gave in support of the conclusion that the parties did not intend to create
legal relations did not relate specifically to the position of Mr and Mrs Balfour but were
of general application. Thus he advanced the floodgates argument (‘the small courts of
this country would have to be multiplied one hundredfold if these arrangements were
held to result in legal obligations’) and also reasons of policy about the role of the law in
the regulation of family relationships (‘the common law does not regulate the form of
agreements between spouses. … The consideration that really obtains for them is that
natural love and affection which counts for so little in these cold Courts.’). This is not to
say that the intention of the parties is irrelevant. Their intention is relevant but it is only
relevant to the rebuttal of the presumption.
Are the reasons given in support of this presumptive exclusion of contract law from the
regulation of family life valid? Professor Michael Freeman, a leading family lawyer, has
concluded that they are not (see ‘Contracting in the Haven: 
Balfour
 
v. 
Balfour
 
Revisited’
in R Halson (ed), 
Exploring the Boundaries of Contract
 
(Dartmouth, 1996), p. 68).
Professor Freeman argues (at pp. 75–77):
The Balfours was a Victorian marriage. The ideals of Victorian marriages and values concerning the family
lasted until perhaps a generation ago. But where the emphasis was on status, it is now on autonomy. For role
identification we have now substituted role distance. The ‘self’ and individual choice have replaced role and
obligation as central organising concepts. … Modern family law, responding to this trend, has embraced
contract as its governing principle. Despite the ruling orthodoxy of 
Balfour
 
v. 
Balfour
, private ordering, rather
than public regulation, has become the preferred means of organising and governing relationships within the
family. … Thus, entry into marriage is less regulated than it was and is more dependent upon individual choice.
… The law is also more willing to let those who are married define the terms of their relationship. Husbands and
wives can sue each other, in contract and in tort. … In addition to greater control over entry into marriage and
its terms, husbands and wives have been given greater powers to determine for themselves when to leave the
marital relationship. … The conceptualisation of marriage as a private matter is emphasised also by the trend to
define marital fault very narrowly in property and money determinations and in disputes about children …
Marriage has become ‘a personal rather than a social institution’, fit for private ordering rather than state
regulation. And yet the official version of the truth is that husbands and wives do not subject their arrangements
to the law of contract. If 
Balfour
 
v. 
Balfour
 
was a ‘wise’ decision based on the ‘realities’ of life, then wisdom
dictates that we rethink the doctrine 
it embodies. It no longer reflects realities nor is it in line with
developments taking place in family law. Once the fiction is rejected we will be in a position to assess the role of
contract in intimate relationships and to examine the relevance of the modern law of contract on the family.
Professor Freeman’s thesis has its attractions in that it recognizes the changes that have
taken place in family life since Victorian times. But it has not commended itself to all
family lawyers (see, for example, G Douglas, 
An Introduction to Family Law
 
(2nd edn,
Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 75–76). It also gives rise to the floodgates problem
identified by Atkin LJ in 
Balfour
. Once the law of contract is admitted into family life,
how far do we allow it to go? That there is a real problem here can be demonstrated by
reference to the following radical proposal made by Professor Anthony Giddens in his
book 
The Third Way
 
(Polity Press, 1998). When discussing the problem of how to
ensure that children are protected and cared for in a society where marriage and
parenthood are becoming increasingly disentangled, he writes (at p. 95):
Contractual commitment to a child could … be separated from marriage, and made by each parent as a binding
matter of law, with unmarried and married fathers having the same rights and the same obligations. Both sexes
would have to recognize that sexual encounters carry the chance of life-time responsibilities, including
protection from physical abuse.
In what may be thought to be something of an under-statement he notes (at p. 96) that
‘enforcing parenthood contracts wouldn’t be without its problems’. It is clear that there
is a vital interest at stake in ensuring that children are properly cared for, but is the
creation of binding contracts between parents and children really the best way to do
this? The presence at the birth of a child of the family lawyer, ready and willing to draw
up a contract between each parent and the child, is not a prospect to be viewed with
enthusiasm. The policy values underpinning 
Balfour
 
seem preferable to those advocated
by both Professor Freeman and Professor Giddens. As Professor Kahn-Freund stated
back in 1952, ‘
Balfour
 
v. 
Balfour
 
is one of those wise decisions in which the courts allow
the realities of life to determine the legal norm which they formulate’ (‘Inconsistencies
and Injustices in the Law of Husband and Wife’ (1952) 15 
MLR
 
133, 138).
7.2.4
 
The Relationship with Consideration
Balfour
 
v. 
Balfour
, in particular the judgment of Duke LJ, demonstrates that there is a
link between the doctrine of intention to create legal relations and the doctrine of
consideration. But they are nevertheless doctrinally distinct. Intention to create legal
relations is an additional hurdle which a claimant must overcome. That is to say, even if
Mrs Balfour had been successful in proving that she had provided consideration for her
husband’s promise to pay her £30 per month, her claim would still have failed (at least
on the reasoning of Atkin LJ, on the ground that she could not prove that she and her
husband had intended to create legal relations, see 
7.2
).
While consideration and intention to create legal relations are doctrinally distinct they
can overlap, in the sense that it is not always entirely clear whether the basis of the
court’s 
decision is the absence of consideration or the absence of an intention to create
legal relations. A helpful illustration of this point is provided by the case of 
White
 
v.
Bluett
 
(1853) 23 LJ Ex 36. A father lent money to his son and the son in return gave his
father a promissory note by which he promised to repay the money. After the father’s
death his executor sought to recover from the son the money that had not been repaid.
The son defended the claim on the basis that his father had promised to discharge him
from his liability to repay provided that he stopped his practice of complaining about his
father’s distribution of his estate. His defence failed. Pollock CB said this (at p. 37):
The plea [of the son] is clearly bad. By the argument a principle is pressed to an absurdity, as a bubble is blown
until it bursts. Looking at the words merely, there is some foundation for the argument, and, following the
words only, the conclusion may be arrived at. It is said, the son had a right to an equal distribution of his
father’s property, and did not complain of his father because he had not an equal share, and said to him, I will
cease to complain if you will not sue upon this note. Whereupon the father said, if you will promise me not to
complain I will give up the note. If such a plea as this could be supported, the following would be a binding
promise: A might complain that another person used the public highway more than he ought to do, and that
other might say, do not complain, and I will give you five pounds. It is ridiculous to suppose that such promises
could be binding. … In reality, there was no consideration whatever. The son had no right to complain, for the
father might make what distribution of his property he liked; and the son’s abstaining from doing what he had
no right to do can be no consideration.
The language of the court is the language of the doctrine of consideration but it may be
that it is the doctrine of intention to create legal relations that best captures the spirit of
the decision to reject the son’s defence. The difficulty with the argument based on
consideration is that the son did have a right to complain, in the sense that he was
entitled to complain, even if he was not entitled to an equal distribution of his father’s
estate. Thus, in giving up his right to complain, he did give up something that he was
entitled to do (although whether that something was something of value in the eyes of
the law is another matter, on which see 
5.2.1
). The better view may be that the basis of
the decision was that there was no intention to create legal relations. But this
proposition is not entirely straightforward either. In the first place the court did not use
the language of intention to create legal relations. But that is not a conclusive objection
given that the doctrine had not been recognized in 1853. A modern court might well
invoke the doctrine of intention to create legal relations on the facts of 
White
. A second
difficulty is that the parties did intend to create legal relations in the sense that it was
accepted that the son was in principle liable to repay the debt. And, if the son was
subject to a liability to repay the debt, why should the father not be liable on his promise
to waive the debt? This is a difficult question to which there are at least two possible
answers. The first is that the father was not liable because the son’s promise was too
vague to be enforceable (and the vagueness may be relevant either to the doctrine of
consideration or to the doctrine of intention to create legal relations). The second is that,
as Parke B commented (at p. 37), it was ‘not immaterial … to observe, that the [father]
did not give the [promissory] note up’. Thus it may well be that he did not intend to
discharge his son from his liability to repay the debt and so he retained the promissory
note in order to evidence the fact that he did not intend to waive the debt and release his
son from his liability to pay.
7.3
 
Social Agreements
A similar presumption operates in the context of social agreements, where the courts
presume that the parties did not intend to create legal relations. In his judgment in
Balfour
 
v. 
Balfour
 
(see 
7.2
) Atkin LJ provided two examples of social agreements that
are not generally intended to give rise to legal relations, namely an agreement between
two people to take a walk together and an offer and acceptance of hospitality. A further
example is provided by the case of 
Lens
 
v. 
Devonshire Club
, The Times, 4 December
1914, where it was held that the winner of a golf competition was not entitled to sue in
order to recover the prize (although many competitions, for example those in national
newspapers, do now give rise to legal relations between the competitors and the
organizers of the competition: see 
O’Brien
 
v. 
MGN Ltd
 
[2002] CLC 33, discussed in
more detail at 
9.3
).
The presumption is a rebuttable one and the factors relevant to the rebuttal of the
presumption in a domestic context are also applicable to social agreements. An example
of a case in which the presumption was held to have been rebutted is provided by the
case of 
Simpkins
 
v. 
Pays
 
[1955] 1 WLR 975. The plaintiff lived with the defendant as her
lodger. Each week the plaintiff, the defendant, and the defendant’s granddaughter
entered a competition in a Sunday newspaper. The plaintiff filled out the coupon in the
defendant’s name. They shared the entry fee and the postage between themselves. One
week they won the prize and the sum of £750 was paid to the defendant. The defendant
refused to pay to the plaintiff a one-third share of the prize. One of the grounds on which
the defendant refused to pay was that she alleged that the agreement made between
them was not intended to be legally binding. Sellers J held that the plaintiff was entitled
to payment of a one-third share of the prize. He concluded (at p. 979):
It may well be there are many family associations where some sort of rough and ready thing is said which would
not, on a proper estimate of the circumstances, establish a contract which was contemplated to have legal
consequences, but I do not so find here. I think that there was here a mutuality in the arrangement between the
parties. It was not very formal, but certainly in effect it was agreed that every week the forecast should go in in
the name of the defendant, and that if there was success, no matter who won, all should share equally. That
seems to be the implication from or the interpretation of what was said, that this was in the nature of a very
informal syndicate so that they should all get the benefit of success.
The reference to ‘mutuality’ is a puzzling one and it has been argued (Unger (1956) 19
MLR
 
96, 98) that it refers to the presence of consideration rather than the presence of
an intention to create legal relations. This point is made as part of a wider argument to
the effect that ‘absence of consideration … provides a simpler and more realistic
explanation of the special quality of domestic agreements’ than does the doctrine of
intention to create legal relations. While it is true that Sellers J does not nail his colours
to the doctrinal mast, counsel for the defendant submitted that the agreement was not
binding because there was no intention to create legal relations and the judgment of
Sellers J appears to be directed principally towards the rebuttal of that submission. The
case is therefore probably best regarded as a case in which the court held that there was
an intention to create legal relations notwithstanding the fact that the agreement was
reached in a social or a domestic context (no formal distinction is drawn between these
two categories and they can overlap). The reasons for the rebuttal of 
the presumption
are probably to be found in the fact that the parties had acted in reliance upon the
agreement in relation to the sharing of the expenses of entering into the competition and
the agreement was not one made in connection with the running of the household (had
the dispute been about whose turn it was to do the ironing, the court may well have
concluded that there was no intention to create legal relations).
The courts have also experienced some difficulty in deciding whether or not an
agreement between workmates to share the cost of travelling to work by car is intended
to be legally binding. The issue arose in a line of cases concerned with the meaning of
the words ‘hire or reward’ in the Road Traffic Act 1930. The relevant provisions have
since been repealed so that the particular point at issue in these cases is no longer a live
one. One of the issues discussed by the courts when deciding whether or not a passenger
had been carried for ‘reward’ was whether a contract had been concluded for the
carriage of the passenger. For example, in 
Coward
 
v. 
Motor Insurers’ Bureau
 
[1963] 1
QB 259 Mr Cole regularly gave a lift to his work colleague Mr Coward on the pillion seat
of his motorcycle. Mr Coward made a contribution to Mr Cole’s expenses. One of the
issues before the court was whether or not Mr Cole had carried Mr Coward ‘for reward’.
The Court of Appeal concluded that he had not. Sellers LJ stated (at p. 271):
The practice whereby workmen go to their place of business in the motor-car or on the motor cycle of a fellow-
workman upon the terms of making a contribution to the costs of transport is well known and widespread. In
the absence of evidence that the parties intended to be bound contractually, we should be reluctant to conclude
that the daily carriage by one of another to work upon payment of some weekly (or it may be daily) sum
involved them in a legal contractual relationship. The hazards of everyday life, such as temporary indisposition,
the incidence of holidays, the possibility of a change of shift or different hours of overtime, or incompatibility
arising, make it most unlikely that either contemplated that the one was legally bound to carry and the other to
be carried to work. It is made all the more improbable in this case by reason of the fact that alternative means of
transport seem to have been available to Coward.
In the later case of 
Albert
 
v. 
Motor Insurers’ Bureau
 
[1972] AC 301 Lord Cross adopted
a different approach. In his view, there may be a contract, at least in relation to
completed journeys. Thus he stated (at p. 340):
It is not necessary in order that a legally binding contract should arise that the parties should direct their minds
to the question and decide in favour of the creation of a legally binding relationship. If I get into a taxi and ask
the driver to drive me to Victoria Station it is extremely unlikely that either of us directs his mind to the
question whether or not we are entering into a contract. We enter into a contract not because we form any
intention to enter into one but because if our minds were directed to the point we should as reasonable people
both agree that we were in fact entering into one. When one passes from the field of transactions of an obviously
business character between strangers to arrangements between friends or acquaintances for the payment by the
passenger of a contribution towards expenses the fact that the arrangement is not made purely as a matter of
business and that if the anticipated payment is not made it would probably never enter into the head of the
driver to sue for it disposes one to say that there is no contract; but in fact the answer to the question ‘contract’
or ‘no contract’ does not depend on the likelihood of an action being brought to enforce it in case of default.
Suppose that when one of Mr Quirk’s fellow workers [Mr Quirk being the driver of the car] got in touch with
him and asked him whether he could travel in his car to Tilbury and back next day, an ‘officious bystander’ had
asked ‘Will you be paying anything for your transport?’ the prospective passenger would have answered at once
‘Of course I will pay’. If the officious bystander had gone on to ask Mr Quirk whether, if he was not paid, he
would sue the man in the county court, Mr Quirk might well have answered … ‘Not bloody likely’. But the fact
that if default was made Mr Quirk would not have started legal proceedings but would have resorted to
extrajudicial remedies does not mean that an action could not in theory have been brought to recover payment
for the carriage. If one imagines such proceedings being brought, a plea on the part of the passenger that he
never meant to enter into a contract would have received short shrift …
7.4
 
Commercial Agreements
Commercial agreements differ from domestic and social agreements in that the
presumption operates the other way. In the case of commercial transactions the courts
presume that the parties did intend to create legal relations and that presumption is not
an easy one to displace. This is particularly so where a term is introduced into a pre-
existing contractual relationship (such as a contract of employment), where there is a
very strong presumption that the term is intended to be legally binding (
Attrill
 
v.
Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 394, [2013] 3 All ER 607, [80]). The strength
of the presumption is such that the issue does not arise frequently in commercial
litigation.
One case in which it did arise, and which produced a division of judicial opinion, is the
decision of the House of Lords in 
Esso Petroleum Ltd
 
v. 
Commissioners of Customs and
Excise
 
[1976] 1 WLR 1. Esso devised a sales promotion scheme for its petrol under which
it offered to give away a World Cup coin to every motorist who purchased four gallons of
Esso petrol (each coin bore the likeness of one member of the England football squad for
the 1970 World Cup competition in Mexico). The Customs and Excise Commissioners
claimed that the coins were chargeable to a purchase tax on the ground that they had
been ‘produced in quantity for general sale’. The House of Lords held that the coins were
not subject to the purchase tax on the ground that they had not been ‘sold’. A contract of
sale is one under which goods are transferred to a buyer in return for a money
consideration called the price. The consideration supplied by the motorists for the coins
was not a money payment but entry into a collateral contract to purchase the
appropriate quantity of petrol. Given that the supply of the coins did not fall within the
scope of the taxation legislation, it was not strictly necessary for their Lordships to
consider whether or not the coins were supplied by Esso as a matter of legal obligation
or by way of gift. Nevertheless, the issue was considered by their Lordships.
By a bare majority they concluded that there was an intention to create legal relations.
Lord Wilberforce, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, and Lord Fraser of Tullybelton were of the
view that the coins were supplied as a matter of contractual obligation (albeit that Lord
Fraser dissented on the ground that he was of the view that the coins had been sold and
thus were chargeable to the purchase tax), whereas Viscount Dilhorne and Lord Russell
of Killowen concluded that the coins were not supplied as a matter of contractual
obligation. In considering whether or not there was an intention to create legal relations
much reliance was placed on Esso’s advertising campaign in which they stated ‘Collect
the full set of thirty coins. 
One coin given when you buy four gallons of petrol.’ Lord
Simon of Glaisdale concluded that the parties did intend to create legal relations. He
stated (at pp. 5–6):
I am … not prepared to accept that the promotion material put out by Esso was not envisaged by them as
creating legal relations between the garage proprietors who adopted it and the motorists who yielded to its
blandishments. In the first place, Esso and the garage proprietors put the material out for their commercial
advantage, and designed it to attract the custom of motorists. The whole transaction took place in a setting of
business relations. In the second place, it seems to me in general undesirable to allow a commercial promoter to
claim that what he has done is a mere puff, not intended to create legal relations (cf. 
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic Smoke
Ball Co
 
[1893] 1 QB 256). The coins may have been themselves of little intrinsic value; but all the evidence
suggests that Esso contemplated that they would be attractive to motorists and that there would be a large
commercial advantage to themselves from the scheme, an advantage to which the garage proprietors also would
share. Thirdly, I think that authority supports the view that legal relations were envisaged …
[He considered 
Rose and Frank Co
 
v. 
JR Crompton and Brothers Ltd
 
(
7.4.1
) and 
Edwards
 
v. 
Skyways Ltd
(
7.4.1
) and continued]
And I venture to add that it begs the question to assert that no motorist who bought petrol in consequence of
seeing the promotion material prominently displayed in the garage forecourt would be likely to bring an action
in the county court if he were refused a coin. He might be a suburban Hampden who was not prepared to forgo
what he conceived to be his rights or to allow a tradesman to go back on his word.
Viscount Dilhorne, on the other hand, concluded that the parties did not have an
intention to create legal relations. He said (at pp. 3–4):
True it is that the respondents are engaged in business. True it is that they hope to promote the sale of their
petrol, but it does not seem to me necessarily to follow or to be inferred that there was any intention on their
part that their dealers should enter into legally binding contracts with regard to the coins; or any intention on
the part of the dealers to enter into any such contract or any intention on the part of the purchaser of four
gallons of petrol to do so.
If in this case on the facts of this case the conclusion is reached that there was any such intention on the part
of the customer, of the dealer and of the respondents, it would seem to exclude the possibility of any dealer ever
making a free gift to any of his customers however negligible its value to promote his sales.
If what was described as being a gift, which would be given if something was purchased, was something of
value to the purchaser, then it could readily be inferred that there was a common intention to enter into legal
relations. But here, whatever the cost of production, it is clear that the coins were of little intrinsic value.
I do not consider that the offer of a gift of a free coin is properly to be regarded as a business matter … I see
no reason to imply any intention to enter into contractual relations from the statements on the posters that a
coin would be given if four gallons of petrol were bought.
Nor do I see any reason to impute to every motorist who went to a garage where the posters were displayed
to buy four gallons of petrol any intention to enter into a legally binding contract for the supply to him of a coin.
On the acceptance of his offer to purchase four 
gallons there was no doubt a legally binding contract for the
supply to him of that quantity of petrol, but I see no reason to conclude that because such an offer was made by
him, it must be held that, as the posters were displayed, his offer included an offer to take a coin. The gift of a
coin might lead a motorist returning to the garage to obtain another one, but I think the facts in this case
negative any contractual intention on his part and on the part of the dealer as to the coin and suffice to rebut
any presumption there may be to the contrary.
It is important to note that 
Esso
 
is a tax case. It is not a case in which a motorist was
bringing a claim against a garage that had refused to give him a coin. The issue was
whether or not the supply of the coins was chargeable to a purchase tax. This required
their Lordships to focus on the obligations of the garage in relation to the supply of the
coin and not their obligations in relation to the supply of petrol. The fact that the coins
had little intrinsic value is often used by commentators to demonstrate the strength of
the presumption in favour of legal relations in a commercial context.
Two principal issues remain to be discussed in terms of the application of the doctrine of
intention to create legal relations to commercial transactions. The first relates to the
circumstances in which the presumption may be rebutted and the second concerns the
relationship between the doctrine of intention to create legal relations and the question
of whether or not the parties intended to contract. We shall consider each issue in turn.
7.4.1
 
Rebuttal of the Presumption
The presumption in favour of legal relations in commercial transactions can be rebutted
but the cases in which it has been rebutted are few. It can be rebutted by the express
stipulation of the parties. In 
Rose and Frank Co
 
v. 
JR Crompton and Bros Ltd
 
[1925]
AC 445 the agreement between the parties contained the following clause:
This arrangement is not entered into, nor is this memorandum written as a formal and legal agreement, and
shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the Law Courts either of the United States or England, but it is only a
definite expression and record of the purpose and intention of the three parties concerned, to which they each
honourably pledge themselves with the fullest confidence—based on past business with each other—that it will
be carried through by each of the three parties with mutual loyalty and friendly co-operation.
The plaintiffs had been appointed as sole agents of the defendants. The agreement was
entered into in 1913 for a three-year period with an option to extend it for a further
period of time. The agreement was extended to March 1920 but in 1919 the defendants
terminated it without giving notice. The plaintiffs sued for breach of contract but the
House of Lords held that the effect of the ‘honour’ clause was to prevent a contract
coming into existence between the parties. Is such a clause contrary to public policy?
Scrutton LJ addressed this particular issue in the Court of Appeal in 
Rose and Frank
[1923] 2 KB 261 and concluded it was not. He stated (at p. 288):
I can see no reason why, even in business matters, the parties should not intend to rely on each other’s good
faith and honour, and to exclude all idea of settling disputes by any outside intervention, with the
accompanying necessity of expressing themselves so precisely that 
outsiders may have no difficulty in
understanding what they mean. If they clearly express such an intention I can see no reason in public policy
why effect should not be given to their intention.
An important distinction must be drawn here. On the one hand, it is contrary to public
policy for parties to a legally binding contract to attempt to oust the jurisdiction of the
court. On the other hand, it is not contrary to public policy for parties to an agreement to
insert into their agreement a clause the effect of which is to prevent their agreement
from amounting to a contract in law.
In every case the court must consider, as a matter of construction, whether or not the
effect of the words used is to rebut the presumption that the parties intended to create
legal relations. In 
Edwards
 
v. 
Skyways Ltd
 
[1964] 1 WLR 349 the defendant employers
promised to make an ‘ex gratia payment’ to employees who were made redundant. The
defendants subsequently sought to go back on their promise, alleging that it was not
legally binding. Megaw J rejected their submission. He stated (at p. 356):
[T]he words ‘ex gratia’ do not, in my judgment, carry a necessary, or even a probable, implication that the
agreement is to be without legal effect. … The words … are used simply to indicate … that the party agreeing to
pay does not admit any pre-existing liability on his part; but he is certainly not seeking to preclude the legal
enforceability of the settlement itself by describing the contemplated payment as ‘ex gratia’. So here, there are
obvious reasons why the phrase might have been used by the defendant company in just such a way. It might
have desired to avoid conceding that any such payment was due under the employers’ contract of service. It
might have wished—perhaps ironically in the event—to show, by using the phrase, its generosity in making a
payment beyond what was required by the contract of service. I see nothing in the mere use of the words ‘ex
gratia’, unless in the circumstances some very special meaning has to be given to them, to warrant the
conclusion that this promise, duly made and accepted, for valid consideration, was not intended by the parties
to be enforceable in law.
Exceptionally, the presumption may be rebutted notwithstanding the absence of an
(a)
(b)
express stipulation to this effect by the parties. So, for example, the presumption may be
rebutted where the context in which commercial parties reach agreement is entirely
social. A recent example of this phenomenon is provided by 
Blue
 
v. 
Ashley
 
[2017]
EWHC 1928 (Comm) where Leggatt J held that the presumption had been rebutted in a
case where the meeting between the parties had taken place in a pub and where the
claimant alleged that the defendant had promised to pay him £15 million if shares in the
company owned by the defendant reached a certain market price. The factors which
persuaded Leggatt J to conclude that the parties did not intend to create legal relations
included the fact that the discussion between the parties was a jocular one and those in
attendance had not at the time believed the promise to take the form of a contractual
commitment. Thus the informality of the occasion may in an appropriate case have the
effect of rebutting the presumption that the parties intended to create legal relations
(see to similar effect 
MacInnes
 
v. 
Gross
 
[2017] EWHC 46 (QB) where the context was a
very informal dinner conversation between two businessmen).
A further example where the presumption that the parties intended to create legal
relations is rebutted is a collective agreement between a trade union and an employer
(or an employer’s association) which is presumed not to be legally enforceable as
between the 
parties to the agreement. This was held to be the case at common law in
Ford Motor Co Ltd
 
v. 
Amalgamated Union of Engineering and Foundry Workers
[1969] 2 QB 303. Statute has now intervened in order to strengthen the common law
position. Thus section 179(1) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation)
Act 1992 states that:
A collective agreement shall be conclusively presumed not to have been intended by the parties to be a legally
enforceable contract unless the agreement—
is in writing, and
contains a provision which (however expressed) states that the parties intend that the agreement shall
be a legally enforceable contract.
Section 179(2) of the Act further provides that a ‘collective agreement which does satisfy
those conditions shall be conclusively presumed to have been intended by the parties to
be a legally enforceable contract’.
7.4.2
 
Did the Parties Intend to Contract?
Rather than seek to rebut the presumption that the parties intended to create legal
relations, a defendant may take the point that the parties did not intend to contract or
otherwise lacked contractual intent. What is the difference, if any, between the
submission that the parties lacked contractual intent and the submission that the parties
did not intend to create legal relations? The answer would appear to be that the former
submission is much wider in scope, in that it can encompass issues such as whether the
parties have in fact reached agreement. The latter submission, by contrast, accepts that
the parties 
have
 
reached agreement and is restricted to the issue of whether the
agreement was intended to create legal obligations.
While it is possible to separate out these two issues in theory, it may not be so easy to do
this in practice. The issues may overlap. This is particularly so in the case where the
agreement between the parties is expressed in vague or uncertain terms. In such a case a
defendant may argue that there is no contract on two grounds: (i) the agreement is too
vague or uncertain to amount to a contract; and (ii) the parties did not intend to create
legal relations. The two grounds are inter-related in that the vagueness or uncertainty of
the agreement may suggest both that the parties did not reach sufficient agreement on
essential matters, and that they lacked an intention to create legal relations.
It may, however, be important to distinguish between the two issues in relation to the
location of the burden of proof. First, it is for the claimant to prove that a contract has
been concluded. But, secondly, once the existence of an otherwise enforceable contract
has been established and the defendant wishes to take the point that the agreement
apparently concluded by the parties was not intended to give rise to legal obligations,
the onus of proof switches to the defendant to prove that the parties did not intend to
create legal relations, at least in the case where the agreement is made in a commercial
context. The relationship between these two issues was considered in more detail by
Mance LJ in 
Baird Textile Holdings Ltd
 
v. 
Marks and Spencer plc
 
[2001] EWCA Civ
274, [2002] 1 All ER (Comm) 737 when he stated (at [59]–[61]) that:
for a contract to come into existence, there must be both (a) an agreement on essentials with sufficient certainty
to be enforceable and (b) an intention to create legal relations.
Both requirements are normally judged objectively. Absence of the former may involve or be explained by
the latter. But this is not always so. A sufficiently certain agreement may be reached, but there may be either
expressly (i.e. by express agreement) or impliedly (e.g. in some family situations) no intention to create legal
relations.
An intention to create legal relations is normally presumed in the case of an express or apparent agreement
satisfying the first requirement. … It is otherwise, when the case is that an implied contract falls to be inferred
from parties’ conduct. … It is then for the party asserting such a contract to show the necessity for implying it …
[I]
  
f the parties would or might have acted as they did without any such contract, there is no necessity to imply
any contract. It is merely putting the same point another way to say that no intention to make any contract will
then be inferred.
The order of the two requirements identified by Mance LJ should be noted. He expressly
rejected a submission that the order should be reversed. In his view it was ‘more
appropriate to take the requirements in the order in which I have set them out, and to
recognize their potential inter-relationship’. This ordering is significant because it puts
the initial onus of proof on to the party alleging the existence of an enforceable contract.
At the same time Mance LJ recognizes that the two issues are inter-related in that an
absence of sufficient agreement on essential matters may well also reflect an absence of
an intention to create legal relations.
7.5
 
The Future of the Doctrine of Intention to
Create Legal Relations
The doctrine of intention to create legal relations has not lacked its critics. Some, such as
Professor Freeman (see 
7.2.3
), are critical of the way in which it has been used to deny
legal effect to agreements made in a family context. Others point out that the doctrine
rests on a fiction in that the parties to the alleged agreements frequently have no
discernible intention one way or the other.
In the light of these and other arguments it has been argued that the doctrine of
intention to create legal relations is, in fact, unnecessary. The case for the elimination of
the doctrine of intention to create legal relations has been put in the following terms (M
Furmston (ed), 
The Law of Contract
, Butterworths Common Law Series (6th edn,
LexisNexis, 2017), para 2.172):
The existence of a separate requirement of intention to create legal relations has … been criticised by a number
of commentators. It is submitted that there is much force in these criticisms and that it is unnecessary to
impose a separate requirement of ‘intention to create legal relations’ over and above those of offer, acceptance
and consideration. A proposal cannot properly be regarded as an offer unless it indicates an intention to
undertake a legal obligation if its terms are accepted and the requested consideration is furnished by the
offeree. Thus a proposal in which the maker indicates, expressly or impliedly, that he does not intend to
undertake a legal obligation cannot properly be regarded as an offer. Similarly, if an offer is made and the
offeree responds agreeing to the terms of the offer but indicating that he does not intend to create a legal
relationship, the offeree’s response cannot properly be regarded as an acceptance of the offer. Where the offer is
of a bilateral contract the offeror requests a promise from the offeree as the consideration for his offer. That
counter-promise must necessarily be legally binding if it is to be regarded as consideration for the offeror’s
promise, so 
that if the offeree makes the requested promise but expressly or impliedly indicates that he does not
intend to be legally bound by his promise (i) his response does not meet the conditions of the offer and
therefore cannot be regarded as an acceptance of it and (ii) his counter-promise cannot be regarded as
consideration for the offeror’s promise. Thus if either offeror or offeree does not intend a legal relationship
there is in fact no offer or acceptance, as the case may be. If the parties agree but neither intends a legal
relationship there is neither offer nor acceptance. If this view is accepted, ‘intention to create legal relations’ is
not a separate, additional requirement, but an aspect of the rules relating to offer, acceptance and
consideration. There is some support for this approach in 
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic Smoke Ball Co
 
where the
defendants argued that their advertisement was not intended to be legally binding and therefore could not be
regarded as an offer, and indeed the cases concerning the classification of proposals as ‘offers’ or ‘invitations to
treat’ are effectively concerned with the question whether the proposal in question is intended to be legally
binding.
The difficulty with this argument is that it does not in fact eliminate the doctrine of
intention to create legal relations; rather it imports it as an element into the rules
relating to offer, acceptance, and consideration. Such a step is likely to make the law
more complex and, for this reason, it is unlikely that the courts will go down this road.
They are more likely to increase the role of the doctrine of intention to create legal
relations. The reduction of the practical significance of the doctrine of consideration (in
the sense that the requirements of the doctrine appear to be easier to satisfy as a result
of the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros & Nicholls
(Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 1, on which see 
5.2.2.3
) is likely to bring the doctrine of
intention to create legal relations into play to a greater extent than before. Thus in
Williams
, Russell LJ stated that ‘the courts nowadays should be more ready to find [the
existence of consideration] so as to reflect the intention of the parties’. In this way it may
fall to the doctrine of intention to create legal relations to distinguish those promises
intended to be binding from those that are not intended to be binding (see to similar
effect the judgment of Rajah JC in 
Chwee Kin Keong
 
v. 
Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd
[2004] 2 SLR 594, 634: ‘the time may have come for the common law to shed the
pretence of searching for consideration to uphold commercial contracts. The marrow of
contractual relationships should be the parties’ intention to create a legal relationship’.)

The Terms of the Contract
Central Issues
The answer to the question whether a statement made by one
contracting party to another, prior to the conclusion of the contract,
has been incorporated into the contract as a term or is merely a
representation that has induced that party to enter into the contract
depends upon the intention of the parties, objectively ascertained. In
seeking to discern the intention of the parties the courts have regard
to a variety of factors that are considered in this chapter.
While the distinction between a term and a representation remains one
of some importance today it is not as important as it was prior to
changes to the law of misrepresentation made by the judiciary in 1963
and by Parliament in 1967. Before these changes were made damages
could be recovered for a fraudulent misrepresentation but not for an
innocent or for a negligent misrepresentation. Thus a plaintiff who
wished to recover damages in respect of an innocent or a negligent
misstatement had to prove that the statement had been incorporated
into the contract as a term in order to recover damages. Now that
damages for misrepresentation are more widely available the
distinction between a term and a representation tends to be of
importance not to the 
existence
 
of the jurisdiction to award damages
but to the 
measure
 
of damages recoverable.
In the case where the parties have reduced their contract to writing an
issue can arise as to whether or not one of the parties is entitled to
lead evidence of the existence of a term not to be found in that written
document. The ‘parol evidence’ rule was thought to exclude such
evidence where its effect was to add to, vary, or contradict the written
document. But the status of this rule is the subject of some
controversy. On one view the rule is a ‘circular statement’ on the basis
that it only applies where the written document is intended by the
parties to contain all the terms of the contract. The other view is that
the rule is not circular because it applies where the document 
looks
like a complete contract (even if it was not so intended by both parties)
and, in such a case, the court will presume that the written document
contains the whole contract in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
8.1
 
Introduction
A contract is composed of a number of terms. The number of terms will obviously
depend upon the importance of the transaction. Large-scale transactions often produce
contracts of considerable length and complexity and some of the standard form clauses,
such as exclusion and limitation clauses, are likely to have been the subject of protracted
negotiation between the parties (or at least between their lawyers). The terms of the
contract are obviously of great significance to the parties because they define their rights
and liabilities. English law gives the parties considerable freedom to define for
themselves the terms of their contract: freedom of contract remains a fundamental part
of English law. Many commercial parties have their own standard terms of business
which they seek to incorporate into the contracts they conclude (hence the so-called
‘battle of the forms’ discussed at 
3.3.1
). However, the freedom of the parties is not
unlimited. Parliament has in recent years intervened to regulate the use of certain types
of contract terms. Initially the intervention was confined principally to exclusion and
limitation clauses but it has since been extended, at least in the context of contracts
between a trader and a consumer, to a much wider range of terms (see further 
14.2
). Not
all terms are, however, agreed expressly by the parties. Some are implied into the
contract either by the courts or by Parliament. Implied terms form an important part of
many contracts, particularly contracts for the sale of goods.
This Part of the book is divided up in the following way. This chapter is devoted to two
issues. The first relates to the identification of the express terms of the contract and the
second concerns written contracts and the extent to which it is permissible to lead
evidence of the existence of terms not found in the written contract. 
Chapter 9
 
deals
with the subject of the incorporation of terms into a contract. This is an important issue
in practice. Many companies spend substantial sums of money on legal advice in
relation to the drafting of their standard terms of business but then fail to take adequate
steps to ensure that these terms are incorporated into the contracts which they
conclude. The subject matter of 
Chapter 10
 
is implied terms. Here the principal
difficulty relates to the legal basis upon which courts imply terms into contracts.
Chapter 11
 
deals with the principles applied by the courts when interpreting contracts.
Many cases that come before the courts raise issues of interpretation or construction
and both the House of Lords and the Supreme Court have been required on a number of
occasions in recent years to re-state the principles by which contract documents are to
be interpreted. 
Chapter 12
 
moves on to consider some standard clauses that are to be
found in commercial contracts today (often known as ‘boilerplate clauses’). The subject
matter of 
Chapter 13
 
is one particular type of boilerplate clause, namely the exclusion or
limitation clause. These clauses have been the subject of a considerable amount of
judicial analysis and the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 was passed in order to regulate
their use. Much of 
Chapter 13
 
is concerned with the statutory control of contract terms
and this theme is developed in 
Chapter 14
 
which is devoted to Part 2 of the Consumer
Rights Act 2015. The latter Act gives to the courts much broader powers to regulate
unfair terms in contracts between a trader and a consumer. 
Chapter 15
 
draws this Part
of the book to a close with a discussion of the role of good faith in contract law. The
location of any discussion of good faith is a matter of real difficulty in English law. The
traditional view taken by the courts is that English contract law does not recognize the
existence of a general principle of good faith and fair dealing (see 
Walford
 
v. 
Miles
[1992] 2 AC 128). While this remains the case in the context of the negotiation of a
contract, the position is now less certain in relation 
to the performance of contracts
where there have been suggestions that the traditional hostility displayed by English
contract law to good faith may be ‘misplaced’ (
Yam Seng Pte Ltd
 
v. 
International Trade
Corporation Ltd
 
[2013] EWHC 111 (QB), [2013] 1 All ER (Comm) 1321, [153]) and the
balance of authority now supports the enforceability of an express term requiring the
parties to act in good faith, at least in the performance of a contract. English law appears
to be isolated in its reluctance to embrace a principle of good faith and fair dealing. Such
a principle is a fundamental part of the law of contract in most civilian legal systems and
it is declared to be a mandatory principle by both the Unidroit Principles of
International Commercial Contracts and the Principles of European Contract Law.
Given the stance currently adopted by English law, it may seem odd to give it its own
chapter. But the reality is that it is an issue that does require analysis and, a notion of
good faith having been introduced into English law initially via the Unfair Terms in
Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994 (and now to be found in Part 2 of the Consumer
Rights Act 2015), this provides helpful context for the discussion. The question which
English law has to answer can be shortly stated, even if it cannot be answered easily. It
is: is the role of good faith in English law confined to those cases that fall within the
scope of Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 or will its influence extend beyond
these cases and into transactions, particularly commercial transactions, that do not fall
within the scope of the legislation?
8.2
 
Two Preliminary Issues
The purpose of this chapter is not to consider the substantive content of the express
terms of a contract. The content of the most important standard clauses found in
commercial contracts is considered later, in 
Chapter 12
. Here we are concerned with two
preliminary issues. The first relates to the identification of the terms of the contract.
How do the courts decide what is and what is not a term of the contract? In the case
where the parties reduce their agreement to the form of a written contract, the answer is
fairly obvious, namely that the content is to be found in the terms set out in the
document. But what about oral statements made prior to the conclusion of the contract?
Are they also terms or are they merely representations which, while they may have
induced one party to enter into the contract, are not part of the contract itself? The
second issue concerns the entitlement of the parties to lead evidence of terms not to be
found in their written contract. Where the parties take the time, trouble, and expense of
reducing their agreement to writing, are they still entitled to adduce evidence of terms
other than those found in the written document or is the written document the sole
source of the terms of their contract? We shall explore each issue in turn.
8.3
 
Terms and Representations
The question whether or not a statement made by one party to the other prior to the
conclusion of the contract has been incorporated into the contract as a term is one of
some importance. If the statement has been incorporated into the contract as a term,
then a failure to comply with it without lawful justification will amount to a breach of
contract. On the other hand, if the statement has not been so incorporated then any
liability cannot be for breach of contract but must be for misrepresentation. The
distinction between a term and 
a representation is an important one but it is not as
significant as it used to be. The primary significance of the distinction lies in the
different remedial responses to a breach of contract and a misrepresentation. We shall
deal with the different remedial responses in more detail in the chapter on
misrepresentation (see 
Chapter 17
). Here it suffices to use one remedial difference for
illustrative purposes. Every breach of contract gives rise to a claim for damages (in the
case where the claimant suffers no loss as a result of the breach, she will still be entitled
to recover damages but they will be nominal). But not every misrepresentation gives rise
to a claim for damages. Indeed, prior to the decision of the House of Lords in 
Hedley
Byrne & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465 and the subsequent enactment
of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, damages could only be recovered for fraudulent
misrepresentations.
 
Fraud is not, however, an easy matter to prove (
Derry
 
v. 
Peek
(1889) 14 App Cas 337). The fact that damages could not be recovered in respect of
negligent or innocent misrepresentations prior to 
Hedley Byrne
 
and the enactment of
the 1967 Act had a significant impact on cases decided prior to these developments. In
these cases a plaintiff who wished to recover damages had either to prove fraud (in order
to recover damages for fraudulent misrepresentation) or prove that the statement had
been incorporated into the contract as a term (in order to recover damages for breach of
contract). In cases where the defendant had clearly not been fraudulent the only hope
for a plaintiff who wished to recover damages was therefore to prove that the statement
had been incorporated into the contract as a term. Cases can be found in which the
courts adopted what appears to be a rather benevolent approach to the identification of
a term in order to give a deserving plaintiff a remedy in damages (see, for example, 
De
Lassalle
 
v. 
Guildford
 
[1901] 2 KB 215). But cases can also be found in which the courts
1
took a stricter view. Thus in 
Heilbut, Symons & Co
 
v. 
Buckleton
 
[1913] AC 30, 51 Lord
Moulton stated that ‘it is … of the greatest importance, in my opinion, that this House
should maintain in its full integrity the principle that a person is not liable in damages
for an innocent misrepresentation, no matter in what way or under what form the attack
is made’.
How then do the courts decide whether or not a statement has been incorporated into a
contract as a term? The answer is that the distinction turns upon the intention of the
parties, objectively ascertained. As John Cartwright has pointed out (
Misrepresentation,
Mistake and Non-Disclosure
 
(5th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2019), para 8.06):
The question, in general terms, is whether the parties intended the statement to be incorporated into the
contract as one of its terms; whether, therefore, the defendant intended to make a contractually binding
promise about the accuracy of his statement.
When seeking to ascertain whether the defendant intended to make a contractually
binding promise about the accuracy of his statement, no one factor predominates. As
Lord Moulton stated in 
Heilbut, Symons
 
(at p. 51), ‘the intention of the parties can only
be deduced from the totality of the evidence, and no secondary principles … can be
universally true’. It is therefore necessary to examine the cases in order to identify the
range of issues to which the courts have regard when seeking to ascertain the intention
of the parties. The approach that will be adopted here is to examine three illustrative
cases and then seek to draw the threads together by setting out the range of factors
taken into account by the courts in their decision-making.
8.3.1
 
Three Illustrative Cases
OSCAR CHESS LTD V. WILLIAMS
[1957] 1 WLR 370, Court of Appeal
The plaintiff car dealers bought a car from the defendant in a part-exchange deal
under which the defendant bought a new car from the plaintiffs’ garage (the
defendant in fact purchased the car from a finance company to which the plaintiffs
had sold the car, but nothing turns on this for present purposes). The events that
led up to the purchase of the car by the plaintiffs were as follows. The defendant
had told one of the plaintiffs’ salesmen that he wished to buy a new car. The
salesman was a neighbour of the defendant and he had been given a lift in the car
on a number of occasions. He thought that the car was a 1948 Morris and indeed
the defendant described the car to him as a 1948 10 h.p. Morris and produced the
registration book for it. The salesman checked the registration book and it showed
that 1948 was the date of first registration. He then consulted a book (known as
‘Glass’s Guide’), which gave him the current prices for second-hand cars according
to the year of their manufacture. On this basis he offered the defendant an
allowance of £290 against the purchase of a new car. The defendant agreed and
the transactions were completed. Eight months later the plaintiffs discovered that
the car was not in fact a 1948 Morris but a 1939 model. If the plaintiffs had known
that it was a 1939 model they would have offered the defendant only £175 for the
car. The defendant honestly believed that the car was a 1948 model. The car had
previously been bought by his mother and she had bought it on the basis that it
was a 1948 model. The car’s registration book showed that it had been first
registered in 1948 and that it had changed hands five times between 1948 and
1954.
The plaintiffs sought to recover from the defendant damages of £115, based on
the difference in value between £290 and £175. The trial judge held that the
defendant was liable in damages but the Court of Appeal allowed the defendant’s
appeal by a majority (Morris LJ dissenting) on the basis that the statement by the
defendant as to the age of the car was not a term of the contract but an innocent
misrepresentation that had induced the plaintiffs to enter into the contract.
Denning LJ
I entirely agree with the judge that both parties assumed that the Morris car was a
1948 model and that this assumption was fundamental to the contract. This does
not prove, however, that the representation was a term of the contract. The
assumption was based by both of them on the date given in the registration book
as the date of first registration. They both believed that the car was a 1948 model,
whereas it was only a 1939 one. They were both mistaken and their mistake was
of fundamental importance.
The effect of such a mistake is this: It does not make the contract a nullity from
the beginning, but it does in some circumstances enable the contract to be set
aside in equity. If the buyer had come promptly, he might have succeeded in
getting the whole transaction set aside in equity on the ground of this mistake: see
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
[1950] 1 KB 671; but he did not do so and it is now too late for him
to do it: see 
Leaf
 
v. 
International Galleries
 
[1950] 2 KB 86. His only remedy is in
damages, and to recover these he must prove a warranty.
In saying that he must prove a warranty, I use the word ‘warranty’ in its ordinary
English meaning to denote a binding promise. Everyone knows what a man means
when he says, ‘I guarantee it’, or ‘I warrant it’, or ‘I give you my word on it’. He
means that he binds himself to it. 
That is the meaning which it has borne in English
law for 300 years from the leading case of 
Chandelor
 
v. 
Lopus
 
(1603), Cro Jac 4
onwards. During the last hundred years, however, the lawyers have come to use
the word ‘warranty’ in another sense. They use it to denote a subsidiary term in a
contract as distinct from a vital term which they call a ‘condition’. In so doing they
depart from the ordinary meaning, not only of the word ‘warranty’, but also of the
word ‘condition’. There is no harm in their doing this, so long as they confine this
technical use to its proper sphere, namely, to distinguish between a vital term, the
breach of which gives the right to treat the contract as at an end, and a subsidiary
term which does not. The trouble comes, however, when one person uses the
word ‘warranty’ in its ordinary meaning and another uses it in its technical
meaning. … These different uses of the word seem to have been the source of
confusion in the present case. The judge did not ask himself, ‘Was the
representation (that the car was a 1948 Morris car) intended to be a warranty?’ He
asked himself, ‘Was it fundamental to the contract?’ He answered it by saying that
it was fundamental, and, therefore, it was a condition and not a warranty. By
concentrating on whether it was fundamental, he seems to me to have missed the
crucial point in the case which is whether it was a term of the contract at all. The
crucial question is: Was it a binding promise or only an innocent
misrepresentation? The technical distinction between a ‘condition’ and a ‘warranty’
is quite immaterial in this case, because it is far too late for the buyer to reject the
car. He can, at best, only claim damages. The material distinction here is between
a statement which is a term of the contract and a statement which is only an
innocent misrepresentation. This distinction is best expressed by the ruling of Lord
Holt: Was it intended as a warranty or not?, using the word warranty there in its
ordinary English meaning: because it gives the exact shade of meaning that is
required. It is something to which a man must be taken to bind himself.
In applying Lord Holt’s test, however, some misunderstanding has arisen by the
use of the word ‘intended’. It is sometimes supposed that the tribunal must look
into the minds of the parties to see what they themselves intended. That is a
mistake. Lord Moulton made it quite clear, in 
Heilbut, Symons & Co
 
v. 
Buckleton
[1913] AC at p. 51, that ‘The intention of the parties can only be deduced from the
totality of the evidence’. The question whether a warranty was intended depends
on the conduct of the parties, on their words and behaviour, rather than on their
thoughts. If an intelligent bystander would reasonably infer that a warranty was
intended, that will suffice. And this, when the facts are not in dispute, is a question
of law. That is shown by 
Heilbut, Symons & Co
 
v. 
Buckleton
 
itself, where the
House of Lords upset the jury’s finding of a warranty.
It is instructive to take some recent instances to show how the courts have
approached this question. When the seller states a fact which is or should be
within his own knowledge and of which the buyer is ignorant, intending that the
buyer should act on it, and he does so, it is easy to infer a warranty; see
Couchman
 
v. 
Hill
 
[1947] KB 554, where the farmer stated that the heifer was
unserved, and 
Harling
 
v. 
Eddy
 
[1951] 2 KB 739, where he stated that there was
nothing wrong with her. So also if the seller makes a promise about something
which is or should be within his own control … But if the seller, when he states a
fact, makes it clear that he has no knowledge of his own but has got his
information elsewhere, and is merely passing it on, it is not so easy to imply a
warranty. Such a case was 
Routledge
 
v. 
McKay
 
[1954] 1 All ER 855, where the
seller ‘stated that it was a 1942 model, and pointed to the corroboration found in
the book’, and it was held that there was no warranty.
Turning now to the present case, much depends on the precise words that
were used. If the seller says: ‘I believe the car is a 1948 Morris. Here is the
registration book to prove it’, there is clearly no warranty. It is a statement of belief,
not a contractual promise. If, however, the seller says: ‘I guarantee that it is a 1948
Morris. This is borne out by the registration book, but you need not rely solely on
that. I give you my own guarantee that it is’, there is clearly 
a warranty. The seller
is making himself contractually responsible, even though the registration book is
wrong.
In this case much reliance was placed by the judge on the fact that the buyer
looked up ‘Glass’s Guide’ and paid £290 on the footing that the car was a 1948
model: but that fact seems to me to be neutral. Both sides believed the car to have
been made in 1948 and in that belief the buyer paid £290. That belief can be just
as firmly based on the buyer’s own inspection of the log-book as on a contractual
warranty by the seller.
Once that fact is put on one side, I ask myself: What is the proper inference
from the known facts? It must have been obvious to both that the seller had
himself no personal knowledge of the year when the car was made. He only
became owner after a great number of changes. He must have been relying on the
registration book. It is unlikely that such a person would warrant the year of
manufacture. The most that he would do would be to state his belief, and then
produce the registration book in verification of it. In these circumstances the
intelligent bystander would, I suggest, say that the seller did not intend to bind
himself so as to warrant that the car was a 1948 model. If the seller was asked to
pledge himself to it, he would at once have said ‘I cannot do that. I have only the
log-book to go by, the same as you’.
The judge seems to have thought that there was a difference between written
contracts and oral contracts. He thought that the reason why the buyer failed in
Heilbut, Symons & Co
 
v. 
Buckleton

v. 
McKay
 
was because the
sales were afterwards recorded in writing, and the written contracts contained no
reference to the representation. I agree that that was an important factor in those
cases. If an oral representation is afterwards recorded in writing, it is good
evidence that it was intended as a warranty. If it is not put into writing, it is evidence
against a warranty being intended; but it is by no means decisive. There have been
many cases where the courts have found an oral warranty collateral to a written
contract. … But when the purchase is not recorded in writing at all it must not be
supposed that every representation made in the course of the dealing is to be
treated as a warranty. The question then is still: Was it intended as a warranty? …
One final word: It seems to me clear that the motor dealers who bought the car
relied on the year stated in the log-book. If they had wished to make sure of it, they
could have checked it then and there, by taking the engine number and chassis
number and writing to the makers. They did not do so at the time, but only eight
months later. They are experts, and, as they did not make that check at the time, I
do not think that they should now be allowed to recover against the innocent seller
who produced to them all the evidence which he had, namely, the registration
book. I agree that it is hard on the plaintiffs to have paid more than the car is worth,
but it would be equally hard on the seller to make him pay the difference. He would
never have bought the Hillman car unless he had received the allowance of £290
for the Morris. The best course in all these cases would be to ‘shunt’ the difference
down the train of innocent sellers until one reached the rogue who perpetrated the
fraud; but he can rarely be traced, or if he can, he rarely has the money to pay the
damages. Therefore, one is left to decide between a number of innocent people
who is to bear the loss. That can only be done by applying the law about
representations and warranties as we know it: and that is what I have tried to do. If
the rogue can be traced, he can be sued by whosoever has suffered the loss: but,
if he cannot be traced, the loss must lie where it falls. It should not be inflicted on
innocent sellers, who sold the car many months, perhaps many years before, and
have forgotten all about it and have conducted their affairs on the basis that the
transaction was concluded. Such a seller would not be able to recollect after all
this length of time the exact words which he used, such as whether he said ‘I
believe it is a 1948 model’, or ‘I warrant it is a 1948 model’. The right course is to
let the buyer set aside the transaction if he finds out the mistake quickly and
comes promptly before other interests have irretrievably intervened, 
otherwise the
loss must lie where it falls: and that is, I think, the course prescribed by law. I would
allow this appeal accordingly.
Hodson LJ
I am of opinion that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that the
statement that the Morris car was a 1948 car was a term of the contract. …
There is, in my opinion, nothing … to indicate that the statement as to the date
of the car amounted to a promise or guarantee that the information given was
accurate.
Morris LJ
[dissenting]
In the present case, on a consideration of the evidence that he heard, the judge
came to the conclusion that the statement which he held to have been made by
the defendant at the time of the making of the contract was a statement made
contractually. It seems to me that the totality of the evidence points to that view.
The statement related to a vitally important matter: it described the subject matter
of the contract then being made and the statement directed the parties to, and was
the basis of, their agreement as to the price to be paid or credited to the defendant.
In the language of Scott LJ [in 
Couchman
 
v. 
Hill
 
[1947] KB 554, 559], it seems to
me that the statement made by the defendant was ‘an item in the description’ of
what was being sold and that it constituted a substantial ingredient in the identity of
the thing sold.
It is with diffidence that I arrive at a conclusion differing from that of my Lords,
but I cannot see that the learned judge in any way misdirected himself or
misapplied any principle of law, and I see no reason for disturbing his conclusion.
Commentary
In order to be able to recover damages the plaintiffs had to show that the defendant’s
statement that the car was a 1948 model was a term of the contract. The word that is
used in the judgments is generally not ‘term’ but ‘warranty’. The difficulty with the latter
word is, as Denning LJ points out, that it also has a technical meaning in that it can refer
to a lesser, subsidiary term of the contract, the breach of which gives to the innocent
party the right to claim damages but does not give him the right to terminate further
performance of the contract (the technical meaning of ‘warranty’ is discussed in more
detail at 
22.3.2
). In this chapter the word ‘term’ will be used in preference to ‘warranty’
for the reason that it describes more clearly the issue that is at stake in the cases. We are
not here concerned with the status of a term of the contract (that is, whether it is
important or not) but with the prior question of whether the statement made has been
incorporated into the contract as a term or not. The central question may be formulated
as follows: has the statement been incorporated into the contract as a term or is it
simply a statement that has induced the other party to enter into the contract but does
not form part of the contract itself?
The Court of Appeal concluded, by a majority, that the defendant’s statement was not a
term but only an innocent misrepresentation. This conclusion was fatal to the plaintiffs’
claim for damages. But it is important to note that the plaintiffs’ claim for damages
would not necessarily fail today. As has been noted, the law has moved on since 
Oscar
Chess
 
was decided in November 1956. In 1963 the House of Lords in 
Hedley Byrne & Co
Ltd
 
v. 
Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465 held that there is a tort of negligent
misrepresentation which gives rise to a liability in damages (see further 
17.5.2
). Section
2 of the Misrepresentation Act 
1967 takes matters further. Section 2(1) imposes a
liability in damages on a misrepresentor whose misrepresentation induces the claimant
to enter into a contract with him unless the misrepresentor can show that he had
reasonable grounds to believe and did believe in the truth of his statement up to the time
that the contract was made (see further 
17.5.1
). Section 2(2) goes still further and gives
to the court a discretionary power to award damages in lieu of rescission in cases of
entirely innocent misrepresentations (see further 
17.5.4
). In the light of these
developments it cannot be assumed that 
Oscar Chess
 
would be decided the same way
today. But, equally, it does not follow that all differences between terms and
representations have been eliminated. In the days of 
Oscar Chess
 
the difference between
a term and a representation was relevant to the 
existence
 
of the jurisdiction to award
damages, whereas today it is relevant to the 
measure
 
of damages recoverable. As we
shall see, the amount recoverable in a misrepresentation claim is generally less than the
sum recoverable in a breach of contract claim. The amount recoverable in a
misrepresentation claim is the claimant’s reliance loss, that is to say the aim of the
award of damages is to compensate the claimant for the loss that he has suffered as a
result of relying to his detriment upon the truth of the statement made. In a breach of
contract claim, on the other hand, the aim of the award of damages is to protect the
claimant’s expectation interest, that is to say the aim is to put the claimant in the
position which he would have been in had the contract been carried out according to its
terms (the difference between the reliance measure and the expectation measure is
discussed in more detail at 
23.2
).
Denning LJ applied an objective test (on which see further 
Chapter 2
) in order to
distinguish between a term and a representation. The distinction therefore depends on
the words used by the parties and their behaviour; it does not depend upon their
innermost thoughts. What factors persuaded the majority in the present case to
conclude that the statement was a representation and not a term? The crucial factor
would appear to have been the knowledge, or rather the lack of it, of the defendant. Both
Denning and Hodson LJJ concluded that it was unlikely that the defendant, given the
state of his knowledge, would have guaranteed that the car was in fact a 1948 model.
Denning LJ also placed emphasis on the fact that the plaintiffs were experts and that
they failed to take appropriate steps to check the vintage of the car. Morris LJ, in his
dissenting judgment, emphasized the importance to the parties of the age of the car (in
the sense that it had a considerable impact on the value of the car) and he also expressed
his unwillingness to interfere with the finding of the trial judge. Denning LJ
acknowledged the significance of the age of the car when he stated that both parties had
made a mistake of ‘fundamental importance’ in relation to the age of the car, but he held
that this was not enough of itself to turn the defendant’s statement into a term of the
contract. In his view, the significance of the importance of the statement was
outweighed by the fact that the defendant lacked specialist knowledge and the fact that
the plaintiffs were experts. The combination of these factors persuaded him to conclude
that the statement was a representation and not a term. The significance of the
knowledge of the parties becomes even more apparent when 
Oscar Chess
 
is contrasted
with the following case:
DICK BENTLEY PRODUCTIONS LTD V. HAROLD SMITH
(MOTORS) LTD
[1965] 1 WLR 623, Court of Appeal
The plaintiff, Dick Bentley, told the defendant, Harold Smith, that he was on the
look-out for a ‘well vetted Bentley car’. Mr Smith found one and bought it for
£1,500. He then informed Mr Bentley of his acquisition. Mr Bentley then went to
see the car. Mr Smith told him that the car had been fitted with a replacement
engine and gearbox and that it had done only 
20,000 miles since the work had
been carried out. The speedometer on the car showed only 20,000 miles. Mr
Bentley agreed to buy the car for £1,850 but the car proved to be a ‘considerable
disappointment to him’. He brought an action for damages for breach of warranty.
Mr Smith admitted that he had made a statement that, to the best of his belief, the
car had done only 20,000 miles since the replacement of the engine and the gear
box but he denied that these statements amounted to warranties or
representations and averred that the statements were made honestly in the belief
that they were true. The trial judge found that certain representations, including the
statement as to mileage, were untrue and amounted to warranties. He accordingly
awarded Mr Bentley damages of £400. Mr Smith appealed to the Court of Appeal
who dismissed his appeal.
Lord Denning MR
The first point is whether this representation, namely, that [the car] had done
20,000 miles only since it had been fitted with a replacement engine and gearbox,
was an innocent misrepresentation (which does not give rise to damages), or
whether it was a warranty. It was said by Holt CJ and repeated in 
Heilbut, Symons
& Co
 
v. 
Buckleton
 
[1913] AC 30 at p. 49, that: ‘An affirmation at the time of the sale
is a warranty, provided it appear on evidence to be so intended’. But that word
‘intended’ has given rise to difficulties. I endeavoured to explain in 
Oscar Chess,
Ltd
 
v. 
Williams
 
[1957] 1 WLR 370 that the question whether a warranty was
intended depends on the conduct of the parties, on their words and behaviour,
rather than on their thoughts. If an intelligent bystander would reasonably infer that
a warranty was intended, that will suffice. What conduct, then? What words and
behaviour, lead to the inference of a warranty?
Looking at the cases once more, as we have done so often, it seems to me that
if a representation is made in the course of dealings for a contract for the very
purpose of inducing the other party to act on it, and actually inducing him to act
upon it, by entering into the contract, that is prima facie ground for inferring that it
was intended as a warranty. It is not necessary to speak of it as being collateral.
Suffice it that it was intended to be acted upon and was in fact acted on. But the
maker of the representation can rebut this inference if he can show that it really
was an innocent misrepresentation, in that he was in fact innocent of fault in
making it, and that it would not be reasonable in the circumstances for him to be
bound by it. In the 
Oscar Chess
 
case the inference was rebutted. … Whereas in
the present case it is very different. The inference is not rebutted. Here we have a
dealer, Smith, who was in a position to know, or at least to find out, the history of
the car. He could get it by writing to the makers. He did not do so. Indeed it was
done later. When the history of this car was examined, his statement turned out to
be quite wrong. He ought to have known better. There was no reasonable
foundation for it.
[He summarized the history of the car, and continued]
The judge found that the representations were not dishonest. Smith was not
guilty of fraud. But he made the statement as to 20,000 miles without any
foundation. And the judge was well justified in finding that there was a warranty. He
said: ‘I have no hesitation [in saying] that as a matter of law the statement was a
warranty. Smith stated a fact that should be within his own knowledge. He had
jumped to a conclusion and stated it as a fact. A fact that a buyer would act on’.
That is ample foundation for the inference of a warranty. So much for the first point
…
[He then dealt with an issue on the counterclaim and on the county court
judge’s award of damages and concluded]
I hold that the appeal fails and should be dismissed.
Danckwerts LJ
 
and 
Salmon LJ
 
agreed with Lord Denning MR.
Commentary
Lord Denning expressly distinguished 
Oscar Chess
 
on the ground that the defendant in
that case had no knowledge of the age of the car and had made his statement in all
innocence. On the present facts Lord Denning had no hesitation in concluding that Mr
Smith was a dealer who was in a position to know, or at least to find out, the history of
the car. Given his knowledge, he was not entitled to turn round and assert that his
statement in relation to the mileage done by the car since the repairs had been carried
out was a mere representation on his part. It was a warranty, for the breach of which he
was liable in damages. It would seem to follow from this case that a statement made by a
dealer in relation to the goods sold will generally be held to be a term of the contract.
Indeed, it may be possible to go further. It has been stated that 
Dick Bentley
 
illustrates
the point that ‘the courts tend to place the responsibility on the person who they think
reasonably ought to bear the responsibility, rather than on the person who has agreed to
bear it, for the simple reason that it is often not apparent whether anybody has agreed to
bear it’ (Atiyah’s 
An Introduction to the Law of Contract
 
(6th edn, Oxford University
Press, 2005), p. 146).
Lord Denning, in both 
Oscar Chess
 
and 
Dick Bentley
, used the language of fault, in that
he concluded that Mr Smith in 
Dick Bentley
 
‘ought to have known better’ while the
plaintiffs in 
Oscar Chess
 
could have checked the vintage of the car by ‘taking the engine
number and chassis number and writing to the makers’. But, while fault may be a
relevant consideration when deciding whether a statement is a term or representation,
liability for breach of contract does not generally depend upon fault so that, even if Mr
Smith had taken all reasonable care to discover whether the car had done more than
20,000 miles since the repair work had been carried out, he would still have been liable
to Mr Bentley in damages when it transpired that the car had, in fact, done more than
20,000 miles.
ESSO PETROLEUM CO LTD V. MARDON
[1976] QB 801, Court of Appeal
In 1961 Esso found a site for a filling station on a busy main road. One of Esso’s
employees, Mr Leith, who had 40 years’ experience in the petrol trade, estimated
that the throughput of petrol at the station would be 200,000 gallons per year by
the third year of operation. After Esso had bought the site and started to build the
station the local planning authority refused permission for the pumps to front onto
the road, so that the station had to be built back to front. Nonetheless when in
1963 Esso interviewed Mr Mardon, a prospective tenant of the station, Mr Leith
stated that the estimated throughput of the station was 200,000 gallons per year.
On that basis Mr Mardon entered into a tenancy agreement with Esso for three
years at a rent of £2,500 for the first two years and £3,000 for the third year.
Despite Mr Mardon’s best efforts, which included raising an overdraft with his bank
and putting all his available capital into the business, in the first 15 months the
throughput of petrol was only 78,000 gallons. The trial judge found that the lack of
throughput was due to the inability of passing traffic to see the pumps. In June
1964 Mr Mardon terminated the tenancy agreement by notice. However Esso
offered him a new tenancy agreement for one year at a rent of £1,000 plus a
surcharge on petrol sold. Mr Mardon entered into the agreement on these terms in
September 1964. But the losses continued. When Mr Mardon failed to pay for
petrol supplied, Esso cut off his supplies and brought an action for moneys owed.
Mr Mardon counterclaimed for damages for breach of warranty as to the
throughput of petrol and for negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge held that
Mr Leith’s statement as to the 
throughput was not a warranty such as to give Mr
Mardon a cause of action for breach of warranty but that Esso was liable for
negligent misrepresentation. The Court of Appeal held that Mr Leith’s statement
was a warranty which Esso had breached. In addition the statement was a
negligent misrepresentation, for which they were also liable.
Lord Denning MR
Collateral warranty
Ever since 
Heilbut, Symons & Co
 
v. 
Buckleton
 
[1913] AC 30, we have had to
contend with the law as laid down by the House of Lords that an innocent
misrepresentation gives no right to damages. In order to escape from that rule, the
pleader used to allege—I often did it myself—that the misrepresentation was
fraudulent, or alternatively a collateral warranty. At the trial we nearly always
succeeded on collateral warranty. We had to reckon, of course, with the dictum of
Lord Moulton, at p. 47, that ‘such collateral contracts must from their very nature
be rare’. But more often than not the court elevated the innocent misrepresentation
into a collateral warranty: and thereby did justice—in advance of the
Misrepresentation Act 1967. I remember scores of cases of that kind, especially on
the sale of a business. A representation as to the profits that had been made in the
past was invariably held to be a warranty. Besides that experience, there have
been many cases since I have sat in this court where we have readily held a
representation—which induces a person to enter into a contract—to be a warranty
sounding in damages. I summarised them in 
Dick Bentley Productions Ltd
 
v.
Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd
 
[1965] 1 WLR 623, 627, when I said:
‘Looking at the cases once more, as we have done so often, it seems to me that if a representation is
made in the course of dealings for a contract for the very purpose of inducing the other party to act upon
it, and actually inducing him to act upon it, by entering into the contract, that is prima facie ground for
inferring that it was intended as a warranty. It is not necessary to speak of it as being collateral. Suffice it
that it was intended to be acted upon and was in fact acted on.’
Mr Ross-Munro [counsel for Esso], retaliated, however, by citing 
Bisset
 
v.
Wilkinson
 
[1927] AC 177, where the Privy Council said that a statement by a New
Zealand farmer that an area of land ‘would carry 2,000 sheep’ was only an
expression of opinion. He submitted that the forecast here of 200,000 gallons was
an expression of opinion and not a statement of fact: and that it could not be
interpreted as a warranty or promise.
Now I would quite agree with Mr Ross-Munro that it was not a warranty—in this
sense—that it did not guarantee that the throughput would be 200,000 gallons.
But, nevertheless, it was a forecast made by a party—Esso—who had special
knowledge and skill. It was the yardstick (the estimated annual consumption) by
which they measured the worth of a filling station. They knew the facts. They knew
the traffic in the town. They knew the throughput of comparable stations. They had
much experience and expertise at their disposal. They were in a much better
position than Mr Mardon to make a forecast. It seems to me that if such a person
makes a forecast, intending that the other should act upon it—and he does act
upon it, it can well be interpreted as a warranty that the forecast is sound and
reliable in the sense that they made it with reasonable care and skill. It is just as if
Esso said to Mr Mardon: ‘Our forecast of throughput is 200,000 gallons. You can
rely upon it as being a sound forecast of what the service station should do. The
rent is calculated on that footing’. If the forecast turned out to be an unsound
forecast such as no person of skill or experience should have 
made, there is a
breach of warranty. Just as there is a breach of warranty when a forecast is made
—‘expected to load’ by a certain date—if the maker has no reasonable grounds for
it: see 
Samuel Sanday and Co
 
v. 
Keighley, Maxted and Co
 
(1922) 27 Com Cas
296; or bunkers ‘expected 600/700 tons’: see 
Efploia Shipping Corporation Ltd
 
v.
Canadian Transport Co Ltd (The Pantanassa)
 
[1958] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 449, 455–457
by Diplock J. It is very different from the New Zealand case where the land had
never been used as a sheep farm and both parties were equally able to form an
opinion as to its carrying capacity: see particularly 
Bisset
 
v. 
Wilkinson
 
[1927] AC
177, 183–184.
In the present case it seems to me that there was a warranty that the forecast
was sound, that is, Esso made it with reasonable care and skill. That warranty was
broken. Most negligently Esso made a ‘fatal error’ in the forecast they stated to Mr
Mardon, and on which he took the tenancy. For this they are liable in damages.
The judge, however, declined to find a warranty. So I must go further.
Negligent misrepresentation
Assuming that there was no warranty, the question arises whether Esso are liable
for negligent misstatement under the doctrine of 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Heller &
Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465 …
It seems to me that 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC
465, properly understood, covers this particular proposition: if a man, who has or
professes to have special knowledge or skill, makes a representation by virtue
thereof to another—be it advice, information or opinion—with the intention of
inducing him to enter into a contract with him, he is under a duty to use reasonable
care to see that the representation is correct, and that the advice, information or
opinion is reliable. If he negligently gives unsound advice or misleading information
or expresses an erroneous opinion, and thereby induces the other side to enter
into a contract with him, he is liable in damages. …
Applying this principle, it is plain that Esso professed to have—and did in fact
have—special knowledge or skill in estimating the throughput of a filling station.
They made the representation—they forecast a throughput of 200,000 gallons—
intending to induce Mr Mardon to enter into a tenancy on the faith of it. They made
it negligently. It was a ‘fatal error’. And thereby induced Mr Mardon to enter into a
contract of tenancy that was disastrous to him. For this misrepresentation they are
liable in damages.
The measure of damages
Mr Mardon is not to be compensated here for ‘loss of a bargain’. He was given no
bargain that the throughput 
would
 
amount to 200,000 gallons a year. He is only to
be compensated for having been induced to enter into a contract which turned out
to be disastrous for him. Whether it be called breach of warranty or negligent
misrepresentation, its effect was 
not
 
to warrant the throughput, but only to induce
him to enter the contract. So the damages in either case are to be measured by
the loss he suffered. Just as in 
Doyle
 
v. 
Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd
 
[1969] 2 QB 158,
167 he can say: ‘ … I would not have entered into this contract at all but for your
representation. Owing to it, I have lost all the capital I put into it. I also incurred a
large overdraft. I have spent four years of my life in wasted endeavour without
reward: and it will take me some time to re-establish myself’.
For all such loss he is entitled to recover damages. It is to be measured in a
similar way as the loss due to a personal injury. You should look into the future so
as to forecast what would have been likely to happen if he had never entered into
this contract: and contrast it with his 
position as it is now as a result of entering into
it. The future is necessarily problematical and can only be a rough-and-ready
estimate. But it must be done in assessing the loss.
Shaw LJ
Mr Mardon complained that ‘he had been sold a pup’. I think he had; but it was a
warranted pup, so that Esso are in breach of warranty and liable in damages
accordingly. … Mr Mardon is entitled in my view to damages for breach of warranty
or for negligent misrepresentation.
Ormrod LJ
 
delivered a concurring judgment.
Commentary
Esso were found liable to Mr Mardon on two grounds, namely breach of warranty and
negligent misrepresentation. We can see that the law of misrepresentation has moved
on since 
Oscar Chess
 
was decided because Lord Denning in his judgment here draws
upon the decision of the House of Lords in 
Hedley Byrne
. Thus the distinction between
a term and a misrepresentation was not, as it was in 
Oscar Chess
, significant in terms of
the 
existence
 
of the right to recover damages. Nor does it appear to have been significant
for the 
measure
 
of recovery. The same sum was recoverable by Mr Mardon whether his
claim was one for breach of a term of the contract or for negligent misrepresentation.
The reason for this was that the warranty found on the facts by the Court of Appeal was
a promise that Esso had used reasonable care and skill in making their forecast as to the
likely throughput of petrol. It was not a case in which Esso had actually guaranteed that
the throughput would reach a given level. Therefore, the appropriate measure of
recovery for breach of the term was not the profit Mr Mardon would have made had the
projected throughput been reached, but the losses he had suffered as a result of relying
to his detriment on the exercise by Esso of reasonable care and skill in making the
projection. This formulation of the warranty given by Esso has been criticized. Thus
Professor Taylor argues (‘Expectation, Reliance and Misrepresentation’ (1982) 45 
MLR
139, 142) that:
Esso
 
v. 
Mardon
 
provides a good illustration of the court limiting the plaintiff to reliance damages precisely
because the gist of his claim is that he has relied on a representation rather than that his expectations have been
disappointed. Of course Mr Mardon’s expectations were 
in fact
 
disappointed but the Court of Appeal clearly did
not think that his was a case where his expectations ought to be legally protected in damages but rather felt that
compensation for reliance incurred because of expectations aroused by the forecast was more appropriate. It
would have been better to express this by denying that the forecast made by Esso was a warranty, rather than by
finding a warranty and then denying that expectation damages were available for it.
8.3.2
 
Drawing the Threads Together
We can see from the decisions in 
Oscar Chess
, 
Dick Bentley
, and 
Esso
 
v. 
Mardon
 
that
the knowledge of the parties is an important factor when seeking to decide whether or
not a statement has been incorporated into a contract as a term. We can also see from
the dissenting 
judgment of Morris LJ in 
Oscar Chess
 
that the importance of the
statement is also a relevant factor (in the sense that the more important the statement,
the more likely it is that it will be incorporated into the contract as a term). Morris LJ
cited as authority for this proposition the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Couchman
v. 
Hill
 
[1947] KB 554. There the plaintiff purchased at an auction a heifer which was
described in the sale catalogue as ‘unserved’. At the auction the plaintiff asked the
defendant vendor and the auctioneer whether the heifer was in fact unserved and was
informed by both that she was. The plaintiff then bought the heifer. He later discovered
that the heifer was in calf and she died as a result of the strain of carrying a calf at too
young an age. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant claiming damages
for breach of warranty. One of the issues in the case was whether the defendant’s oral
representation at the auction was a warranty or not. The Court of Appeal concluded that
it was and, in doing so, had regard to the importance to the plaintiff of the assurance
given to him by the defendant that the heifer was unserved.
The range of factors taken into account by the courts extends beyond those we have
already identified. The authorities have been helpfully summarized in the following
terms in 
Anson’s Law of Contract
 
(31st edn, Oxford University Press, 2020, (edited by J
Beatson, A Burrows, and J Cartwright), p. 141):
In endeavouring to reach a conclusion as to the parties’ intentions, the Courts can be said to take into account a
number of factors, although none is in itself decisive. First, they may have regard to the time which elapsed
between the time of making the statement and the final manifestation of agreement; if the interval is a long one,
this points to a representation. Secondly, they may consider the importance of the statement in the minds of the
parties; a statement which is important is likely to be classed as a term of the contract. Thirdly, if the statement
was followed by the execution of a formal contract in writing, it is more likely to be regarded as a representation
where it is not incorporated in the written document. Finally, where the maker of the statement is, 
vis-à-vis
 
the
other party, in a better position to ascertain the accuracy of the statement or has the primary responsibility for
doing this, the Courts will tend to regard it as a contractual term.
But even this list is not complete. A further factor taken into account by the courts is
whether or not the maker of the statement asks the other party to verify the truth of his
statement. Where he does ask the other party to verify its truth it is unlikely that the
statement will amount to a term (
Ecay
 
v. 
Godfrey
 
(1947) 80 Ll LR 286). Conversely,
where he states expressly that there is no need to verify its truth, it is more likely that the
statement will amount to a term (
Schawel
 
v. 
Reade
 
[1913] IR 64). It is not possible to
define exhaustively the list of factors to which the courts will have regard. But we have
been able to identify the principal factors taken into account by the courts. Whether or
not a statement is incorporated into a contract as a term depends ultimately upon the
facts of the individual case and, as 
Oscar Chess
 
demonstrates, judges can and do differ
in the conclusions which they reach in individual cases.

The Parol Evidence Rule
The second issue that arises for consideration concerns the situation where the parties
have reduced their contract to writing. In such a case is it possible for them to lead
evidence of terms other than those contained in their written contract or does the
written contract constitute 
the sole repository of the terms of their contract? This is not
an easy question to answer. The answer depends upon the scope of what is generally
referred to as the ‘parol evidence rule’. The scope of this rule is a matter of some
controversy. One view is that the rule amounts to no more than this: that in the case
where the parties intend that the written document shall contain all the terms of their
contract it is not possible to lead evidence for the purpose of adding to, varying,
subtracting from, or contradicting the terms contained in that document. An alternative
view is that the rule does not rest on the intention of both parties but consists of a
presumption made by the court that a document that looks like the whole contract is in
fact the whole contract so that it is not possible to lead evidence for the purpose of
adding to, varying, subtracting from, or contradicting the terms contained in the written
document. Two contrasting views of the rule are set out in the following passages:
LAW COMMISSION NO 154,
Law Of Contract: The Parol Evidence Rule
 
(1986)
Nature of the parol evidence rule
2.6. So far as we are aware, no English or Commonwealth court has ever found it
necessary to analyse the parol evidence rule in detail as to its applicability, width
and effect. In the cases in which the rule has been mentioned, it has generally
been in terms which seem to indicate that the judge thought it was both obvious
and well known. For the purpose of deciding whether the parol evidence rule
should be abolished or amended by statute, it has been necessary to analyse the
rule in detail. We had to be clear as to what the rule was which might be abolished,
amended or declared.
2.7.
 
We have now concluded that although a proposition of law can be stated
which can be described as the ‘parol evidence rule’ it is not a rule of law which,
correctly applied, could lead to evidence being unjustly excluded. Rather, it is a
proposition of law which is no more than a circular statement: when it is proved or
admitted that the parties to a contract intended that all the express terms of their
agreement should be as recorded in a particular document or documents,
evidence will be inadmissible (because irrelevant) if it is tendered only for the
purpose of adding to, varying, subtracting from or contradicting the express terms
of that contract. We have considerable doubts whether such a proposition should
properly be characterised as a ‘rule’ at all, but several leading textbook writers and
judges have referred to it as a ‘rule’ and we are content to adopt their terminology
for the purposes of this report.
2.8.
 
Our conclusion as to the nature of the parol evidence rule is no new
theory. The opinions of some leading textbook writers, who reached a similar
conclusion long before we approached the subject, confirm us in our view that the
parol evidence rule is no more than as we have stated above …
2.9.
 
The two principal reasons which have led us to our conclusion on the
nature of the parol evidence rule are, in substance, two aspects of the same
process of reasoning.
2.10.
 
The first relates to the circumstances in which the rule is to be applied.
In our view, some statements of the rule may have given rise to misunderstandings
because they have concentrated on the effect of the rule rather than when it is to
be applied. The effect of the rule is to exclude evidence or to cause the judge to
ignore the evidence if given. As to the application of the rule, Lord Morris’
statement in Bank of 
Australasia
 
v. 
Palmer
 
refers to the inadmissibility of parol
evidence to ‘contradict, vary, add to or subtract from the terms of a written
contract’. Thus, the rule can only be applied where the parties have entered into a
written contract when ‘the writing is intended by the parties as a contractual
document which is to contain all the terms of their agreement’. When the parties
have set down all the 
terms of their contract in writing, extrinsic evidence of other
terms must be ignored. If the contract is not entirely in writing, it is not a written
contract. … If it is proved or admitted that all the terms of the contract have been
set out in a particular document or documents, then evidence of other terms must
be irrelevant and therefore inadmissible, because inconsistent with the finding that
the parties have entered into a written contract.
2.11.
 
The second reason for our conclusion as to the nature of the parol
evidence rule is exemplified by the concept of the contract which is made partly
orally and partly in writing …
2.12.
 
Because a contract can be made partly orally and partly in writing, the
mere production of a contractual document, however complete it may look, cannot
as a matter of law exclude evidence of oral terms if the other party asserts that
such terms were agreed. If that assertion is proved, evidence of the oral terms
cannot be excluded because the court will, by definition, have found that the
contractual terms are partly to be found in what was agreed orally as well as in the
document in question. No parol evidence rule could apply. On the other hand, if
that assertion is not proved, there can be no place for a parol evidence rule
because the court will have found that all the terms of the contract were set out in
the document in question and, by implication, will thereby have excluded evidence
of terms being found elsewhere …
2.13.
 
Of course, the more the parties have done to create what appears to be
a written contract, the greater are the probabilities that the court will conclude that
they did indeed make such a contract. In this connection, in considering the parol
evidence rule in 1959, Professor Lord Wedderburn concluded that,
‘What the parol evidence rule has bequeathed to the modern law is a presumption—namely that a
document which 
looks
 
like a contract is to be treated as the 
whole
 
contract.’
While we have no doubt that this statement accurately reflects the practical effect
of the parol evidence rule as we now believe it to be, the presumption (which can
be displaced by evidence) is not a rule of law laying down whether a particular type
of evidence should be admitted or, if it is admitted, whether the court should give
effect to it. Moreover, we do not think that in this context it is strictly correct to refer
to a ‘presumption’. In reaching a conclusion as to whether a document which looks
like a complete contract was the whole contract, the court does not apply any
presumption of law. Rather, it will reach its conclusion on the evidence tendered,
applying to its judgment the prima facie probability derived from its experience of
how people normally behave in a given situation. For example, if the plaintiff
proves that the parties signed a document, such as a complicated lease of a
commercial chattel, which document appears to be a complete contract and which
is in a form generally adopted for setting out all the contractual terms, it may be
difficult in practice for the defendant to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that
terms were orally agreed in addition to those set out in the document.
2.14.
 
The issue whether parties intended that the whole of their agreement
should be as recorded in a particular document or documents is to be judged
objectively. The court is not concerned with whether both parties, in their minds,
intended the writing to contain the whole of the agreement between them but
whether, having regard to what was said or done, and to what documents were
signed and exchanged, and when, a reasonable person would have understood
the writing to contain the whole of the agreement. A party is not permitted to give
evidence of his private but uncommunicated intention as to what was to be agreed,
or as to what the written agreement was to mean.
2.15.
 
Sometimes parties may include in their contracts a clause to the effect
that the whole contract is contained in the document and that nothing was agreed
outside it (sometimes 
called a ‘merger’ or ‘integration’ clause). In particular, it may
be provided that nothing said during negotiations is intended to be of any
contractual effect unless recorded in the document. Without legislative provision
such a clause cannot, we think, have conclusive effect. It may have a very strong
persuasive effect but if it were proved that, notwithstanding the clause, the parties
actually intended some additional term to be of contractual effect, the court would
give effect to that term because such was the intention of the parties. If the parties
intended that the additional term should have been recorded in the document, the
contract could be rectified. If it had been their intention that the term should be of
contractual effect but not be included in the document, the analysis likely to be
adopted by the court is that the parties agreed a collateral contract alongside the
written one. But if it were proved that the intention of the parties was to make one
contract partly in writing and partly orally, the court would give effect to that
contract. The parties might have been aware of the integration clause when they
agreed the additional terms but have agreed to ignore it, or they might have
forgotten about the clause or never read it. Whatever the reason for there being an
integration clause and additional terms, the court will give effect to the intention of
the parties as it is proved or admitted to have been ….
2.17.
 
The conclusion which emerges from the discussion above is that there is
no rule of law that evidence is rendered inadmissible or is to be ignored solely
because a document exists which looks like a complete contract. Whether it is a
complete contract depends upon the intention of the parties, objectively judged,
and not on any rule of law.
Treitel states by way of reply:
GH TREITEL, 
THE LAW OF CONTRACT
(15
 
edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited by Edwin Peel), para 6–022
It has been argued [by the Law Commission] that the right of a party to rely on
extrinsic evidence … turns the parol evidence rule (as applied to contracts) into ‘no
more than a circular statement’. For if the rule applies only where the written
document is intended to contain 
all
 
the terms of the contract, evidence of other
terms would be useless even if admitted (since they would not form part of the
contract); while the rule never prevents a party from relying on evidence of terms
which 
were
 
intended to be part of the contract. Accordingly, on this view, no
injustice is caused by the operation of the rule. There is much force in this view in
cases in which, at the time of contracting, both parties actually shared a common
intention with regard to the term in question. But in most cases in which the rule is
invoked this is not the position: the dispute arises precisely because the parties
had different intentions, and one alleges, while the other denies, that terms not set
out in the document were intended to form part of the contract. In such cases, the
court will attach importance to the appearance of the document: if it 
looks
 
like a
complete contract to one of the parties taking a reasonable view of it, then the rule
will prevent the other party from relying on extrinsic evidence to show that the
contract also contained other terms.
This result has been described as being simply an application of the objective
test of agreement; but, even if it can be so regarded, it is such a common and
frequently recurring application of this test as to amount to an independent rule. In
cases of the present kind, moreover, the law goes beyond the normal objective
test. That test normally requires the party relying on it to prove that he reasonably
believed that the other party was contracting on the terms alleged. Where a
document 
looks
 
like a complete contract, the party relying on it does not have 
to
prove that he had such a belief: he can rely on a presumption to that effect which it
th
is up to the other party to rebut. As laymen are known to attach greater importance
than the law does to writing in a contractual context, it will be hard for the party
relying on extrinsic evidence to rebut the presumption that the written document
was an exclusive record of the terms agreed. Moreover, the objective test normally
prevents a party from relying on his ‘private but uncommunicated intention as to
what was to be agreed’. The presumption which applies in the case of an
apparently complete contractual document goes beyond this: it prevents a party
from relying on evidence of intention that was not ‘private and uncommunicated’ at
all, but simply not recorded in the document.
For these reasons, it is submitted that the admissibility of extrinsic evidence,
where it is proved that the document was not in fact intended to contain all the
terms of the contract, does not turn the rule into a merely ‘circular statement’.
Whether it also supports the conclusion that the rule is not one that ‘could lead to
evidence being unjustly excluded’ is perhaps more doubtful. The primary purpose
of the rule, like that of the objective test of agreement, is to promote certainty,
sometimes even at the expense of justice. Where the parties have brought into
being an apparently complete contractual document, the rejection of evidence of
extrinsic terms that were actually agreed may cause injustice to the party relying
on those terms, while the reception of such evidence may cause injustice to the
other party, if he reasonably believed that the document formed an exclusive
record of the contract. The question is which, on balance, is the greater injustice.
Where the evidence is rejected because the party relying on it cannot overcome
the presumption arising from the fact that the document 
looks
 
like a complete
contract, the greater injustice would appear to lie in the exclusion of the evidence;
for the presumption seems to be based on the nature and form of the document,
rather than on any actual belief of the party relying on it, that it formed an exclusive
record of the contract.
Commentary
The difference between these two views is not as stark as might at first sight appear. The
reason for this is that any presumption that a document that looks like the whole
contract is the whole contract does not appear to be a particularly strong one. This
brings Treitel’s view much closer to that of the Law Commission in the sense that it
seems unlikely that the presumption will preclude a party from leading evidence of
terms which it is argued were intended to be part of the contract. The modern court is
more likely to admit the evidence and evaluate its significance than declare it to be
inadmissible.
In any event, it is clear that the parol evidence rule, whatever its true scope, is the
subject of a number of exceptions. For example, evidence is admissible to prove a
custom (
Hutton
 
v. 
Warren
 
(1836) 1 M & W 466, see 
10.3
), to show that the contract is
invalid on a ground such as misrepresentation, to show that the document should be
rectified, and to prove the existence of a collateral agreement (
City and Westminster
Properties (1934) Ltd
 
v. 
Mudd
 
[1959] Ch 129).
The final point to be made relates to the wisdom of this drift towards the admissibility of
such evidence and the desirability of leaving it to the court to evaluate its significance.
There has been a commercial reaction against this trend, largely because it is said to
promote uncertainty. The Law Commission at paragraph 2.15 of their report (extracted
earlier) refer to ‘merger’ or ‘integration’ clauses. These clauses are often referred to
today as ‘entire agreement clauses’. We shall encounter them in more detail later (see
12.3.10
). Here it suffices to note that the purpose of these clauses is generally to shut out
evidence that the parol 
evidence rule would probably have excluded in the past. So
evidence that is now admissible as a matter of law is sought to be excluded from judicial
consideration by contractual stipulation. The Law Commission state that such
provisions cannot have ‘conclusive effect’. The scope of an entire agreement clause is a
question of interpretation of the particular clause which has been agreed between the
parties. Where the effect of the clause is to identify the terms of the contract and to
prevent a party from asserting that there are other terms to the contract not to be found
in the written agreement, the courts are more likely to give effect to the clause and to
exclude the term sought to be added to the written document. But in the case where the
effect of the clause is claimed to be to defeat a claim in misrepresentation that otherwise
would exist, the courts have been much more hesitant and any such clause is likely to be
subject to challenge under section 3 of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 if it is
unreasonable (see 
First Tower Trustees Ltd v. CDS (Superstores International) Ltd
[2018] EWCA Civ 1396, [2019] 1 WLR 637, see 
17.6
). But the drafting of entire
agreement clauses is a matter of great difficulty and the time and expense that is
devoted by commercial parties and their lawyers to the drafting of such clauses tends to
suggest that the relaxation of the parol evidence rule that has taken place over the last
100 years or more might not necessarily have been a desirable development.

Incorporation of Terms
Central Issues
In order to be effective a term must have been incorporated into the
contract between the parties. Incorporation can be a surprisingly
difficult issue in commercial practice. Many businesses spend
significant sums of money on legal advice in relation to the drafting of
their standard terms of business but then adopt what appears to be a
surprisingly lax approach when it comes to ensuring that these
standard terms are incorporated into the contracts they conclude. It is
a noticeable feature of litigation concerning standard form clauses,
such as exclusion clauses and retention of title clauses, that the
defendant frequently takes the point that the term in issue between the
parties has not been incorporated into the contract. Incorporation
issues are not, however, confined to exclusion clauses or retention of
title clauses. They can arise in relation to any contract term.
The simplest method of incorporation is signature. A party is generally
bound by terms he has signed, whether or not he has read them. This
rule can produce harsh results and it has been criticized on this basis.
The justification that is usually offered in support of the rule is that it
promotes certainty and protects the interests of third parties who may
rely to their detriment upon the validity of the signature.
Terms can also be incorporated into a contract by notice. In order to
be effective the notice must have been given at or before the time of
contracting, in a document that was intended to have contractual
effect and reasonable steps must have been taken to bring the terms
to the notice of the other party. Where the term is ‘onerous’ or
‘unusual’ greater steps must be taken to bring it to the attention of the
other party. This rule is firmly established in English law but it is open
to criticism on the ground that it gives rise to uncertainty (in terms of
4.
defining a clause that is ‘onerous’ or ‘unusual’) and on the basis that
no convincing justification has been offered for differentiating
between different terms in relation to their incorporation. Attempts to
regulate the fairness of the terms of a contract should be done directly
and not by the back door of the rules relating to the incorporation of
terms.
Finally terms can be incorporated into a contract by virtue of a course
of dealing or as a result of the custom of the trade. In order to
constitute a ‘course of dealing’ there must have been a series of
transactions between the parties that was both ‘consistent’ and
‘regular’.
9.1
 
Introduction
The incorporation of terms into a contract can be a contentious issue in practice. A
failure by a party to take adequate steps to ensure that its standard terms are
incorporated into the contracts it concludes can be an expensive mistake. A simple
illustration of this point is provided by the facts of 
Poseidon Freight Forwarding Co Ltd
v. 
Davies Turner Southern Ltd
 
[1996] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 388. A fax was sent by the
defendants to the plaintiff. At the bottom of the fax appeared the words ‘NOTE: The only
conditions on which we transact business are shown on the back’. Unfortunately, it
would appear that no one had informed the employee of the defendants who was
operating the fax machine that it was necessary to fax the back page as well as the front
page. So the terms on the back were never sent to the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal held
that, in these circumstances, the defendants’ terms had not been incorporated into the
contract so that the defendants were unable to rely on an exemption clause contained in
their standard terms. Leggatt LJ stated (at p. 394):
[t]his is not a case where a party declares that the terms are available for inspection. It is a case where, on
documents sent by fax, reference is made to terms stated on the back, which are, however, not stated or
otherwise communicated. Since what was described as being on the back was not sent, it was a more cogent
inference that the terms were not intended to apply.
How can a party take adequate steps to ensure that its terms are incorporated into the
contracts it concludes? Three principal options are available. The first is to ensure that
the other party to the contract signs the document that contains all the relevant terms.
The general rule in English law is that a party is bound by his signature and this rule
applies whether or not the party signing the document has read it. The second is to take
reasonable steps to bring the terms to the notice of the other party. This is a less reliable
method of incorporation than signature because of the need to persuade the court that
‘reasonable steps’ have been taken (and, as we shall see, it is not always an easy task to
persuade a court that reasonable steps have been taken). The third option is
incorporation by course of dealing or by custom. The last option is the least satisfactory
option, largely because of the difficulties involved in establishing the existence of a
course of dealing that is sufficiently consistent and regular for it to amount in law to a
‘course of dealing’. Incorporation by custom is easier to establish where both parties
transact in a particular market or trade: in such a case the court may be relatively willing
to infer that the customary trade terms have been incorporated into the parties’
contract. It is, however, the case that it is safer to take more active steps to ensure that
terms are incorporated into a contract, whether these active steps take the form of
obtaining the signature of the other party or taking reasonable steps to bring the terms
to the notice of the other party.
9.2
 
Incorporation by Signature
A party is, in general, bound by his signature. This being the case, a party who signs a
contract will, in principle, be bound by its terms. This is so, whether the party signing
the document has actually read it or not. A party who does not want to be bound by the
terms contained in the document should not sign it. The law does not in general allow
him to sign the document and afterwards claim that he is not bound by its terms on the
basis that he had 
not read or understood its terms. The general rule that a party is
bound by his signature can lead to harsh results, as the following case demonstrates:
L’ESTRANGE V. F. GRAUCOB LTD
[1934] 2 KB 394, Divisional Court
Two of the defendants’ representatives visited the plaintiff and asked her to buy an
automatic slot machine for cigarettes. The plaintiff was the owner of a café in
Llandudno. She agreed to buy the machine and signed a ‘Sales Agreement’
produced by one of the defendants’ representatives. The document, so far as
relevant, provided:
‘Sales Agreement. Date Feb. 7, 1933. To F. Graucob, Ltd, … Please forward me as soon as possible:
One Six Column Junior Ilam Automatic Machine … which I agree to purchase from you on the terms
stated below … and to pay for the same in the following manner: Instalments 8l. 15s. 0d. down. 18
payments of 3l. 19s. 11d.’
There then followed some clauses in small print which, so far as material,
provided:
‘I agree to take delivery of the machine upon receiving notice that it is ready for delivery, and to make the
first monthly payment 30 days after the date following that of the posting of such notice and all
subsequent payments on the corresponding date of each succeeding month. … If any payment shall not
have been received by you within a fortnight after it has become due, all the remaining payments shall
fall due for immediate payment, and I agree to pay interest on these remaining payments at the rate of
ten per cent. per annum as from the date of their so falling due. In consideration of your undertaking to
put in hand at once work on this machine I agree not to countermand this order. … This agreement
contains all the terms and conditions under which I agree to purchase the machine specified above, and
any express or implied condition, statement, or warranty, statutory or otherwise not stated herein is
hereby excluded. … (sgd.) H. M. L’Estrange.’
The machine was delivered to the plaintiff some six weeks later but the machine
did not work satisfactorily and after a few days became jammed and unworkable.
The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants. One of the claims advanced
by the plaintiff was that the machine was not fit for the purpose for which it had
been sold. The defendants denied liability on the basis that the agreement
expressly provided for the exclusion of this and all other implied warranties. The
plaintiff in turn contended that she was induced to sign the contract by the
misrepresentation that it was an order form and that at the time when she signed
she knew nothing of the conditions. The county court judge held that the
defendants were not entitled to rely upon the clause which excluded implied
warranties from the contract on the ground that they had not done what was
reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of the conditions. The defendants
appealed to the Court of Appeal who allowed the appeal. It was held that the
plaintiff had not been induced to sign the contract by any misrepresentation and
that she was bound by her signature. She was therefore bound by the terms of the
contract, including the exclusion clause, and judgment was entered for the
defendants.
Scrutton LJ
[set out the facts and continued]
As to the defence that no action would lie for breach of implied warranty, the
defendants relied upon the following clause in the contract: ‘This agreement
contains all the terms and 
conditions under which I agree to purchase the machine
specified above and any express or implied condition, statement, or warranty,
statutory or otherwise not stated herein is hereby excluded’. A clause of that sort
has been before the Courts for some time. The first reported case in which it made
its appearance seems to be 
Wallis, Son & Wells
 
v. 
Pratt & Haynes
 
[1911] AC 394,
where the exclusion clause mentioned only ‘warranty’ and it was held that it did not
exclude conditions. In the more recent case of 
Andrews Brothers (Bournemouth),
Ltd
 
v. 
Singer & Co
 
[1934] 1 KB 17, where the draftsman had put into the contract of
sale a clause which excluded only implied conditions, warranties and liabilities, it
was held that the clause did not apply to an express term describing the article,
and did not exempt the seller from liability where he delivered an article of a
different description. The clause here in question would seem to have been
intended to go further than any of the previous clauses and to include all terms
denoting collateral stipulations, in order to avoid the result of these decisions.
The main question raised in the present case is whether that clause formed
part of the contract. If it did, it clearly excluded any condition or warranty.
In the course of the argument in the county court reference was made to the
railway passenger and cloak-room ticket cases. … These cases have no
application when the document has been signed. When a document containing
contractual terms is signed, then, in the absence of fraud, or, I will add,
misrepresentation, the party signing it is bound, and it is wholly immaterial whether
he has read the document or not.
The plaintiff contended at the trial that she was induced by misrepresentation to
sign the contract without knowing its terms, and that on that ground they are not
binding upon her. The learned judge in his judgment makes no mention of that
contention of the plaintiff, and he pronounces no finding as to the alleged
misrepresentation. There is a further difficulty. Fraud is not mentioned in the
pleadings, and I strongly object to deal with allegations of fraud where fraud is not
expressly pleaded. I have read the evidence with care, and it contains no material
upon which fraud could be found …
In this case the plaintiff has signed a document headed ‘Sales Agreement’,
which she admits had to do with an intended purchase, and which contained a
clause excluding all conditions and warranties. That being so, the plaintiff, having
put her signature to the document and not having been induced to do so by any
fraud or misrepresentation, cannot be heard to say that she is not bound by the
terms of the document because she has not read them.
Maugham LJ
I regret the decision to which I have come, but I am bound by legal rules and
cannot decide the case on other considerations.
The material question is whether or not there was a contract in writing between
the plaintiff and the defendants in the terms contained in the brown paper
document …
In the present case on February 7, 1933, an order form, for such I consider the
brown paper document to be, was signed by the plaintiff. It was an elaborate form
containing a number of clauses, and among them certain terms and conditions in
regrettably small print but quite legible. The plaintiff having signed that document
gave it to a canvasser of the defendants, who took it away. It had been filled up in
ink by the canvasser before she signed it. Another document called an order
confirmation dated February 9, 1933, was sent to her by the defendants. In my
opinion the contract was concluded not when the brown order form was signed by
the plaintiff but when the order confirmation was signed by the defendants. If the
document signed by the plaintiff was a part of a contract in writing, it is impossible
to pick out certain clauses from it and ignore them as not binding on the plaintiff …
I deal with this case on the footing that when the order confirmation was signed
by the defendants confirming the order form which had been signed by the plaintiff,
there was then a signed contract in writing between the parties. If that is so, then,
subject to certain contingencies, there is no doubt that it was wholly immaterial
whether the plaintiff read the small print or not …
There are, however, two possibilities to be kept in view. The first is that it might
be proved that the document, though signed by the plaintiff, was signed in
circumstances which made it not her act. That is known as the case of Non est
factum. … The written document admittedly related to the purchase of the machine
by the plaintiff. Even if she was told that it was an order form, she could not be
heard to say that it did not affect her because she did not know its contents.
Another possibility is that the plaintiff might have been induced to sign the
document by misrepresentation. She contended that she was so induced to sign
the document inasmuch as (i.) she was assured that it was an order form, (ii.) that
at the time when she signed it she knew nothing of the conditions which it
contained. The second of these contentions is unavailing by reason of the fact that
the document was in writing signed by the plaintiff. As to the first contention it is
true that the document was an order form. But further, if the statement that it was
an order form could be treated as a representation that it contained no clause
expressly excluding all conditions and warranties, the answer would be that there
is no evidence to prove that that statement was made by or on behalf of the
defendants.
In this case it is, in my view, an irrelevant circumstance that the plaintiff did not
read, or hear of, the parts of the sales document which are in small print, and that
document should have effect according to its terms. I may add, however, that I
could wish that the contract had been in a simpler and more usual form. It is
unfortunate that the important clause excluding conditions and warranties is in
such small print. I also think that the order confirmation form should have
contained an express statement to the effect that it was exclusive of all conditions
and warranties.
I agree that the appeal should be allowed.
Commentary
Three points should be noted about 
L’Estrange
. The first is that the Court of Appeal
recognized that the rule that a person is bound by his signature is not an absolute one
but is the subject of a number of exceptions to which we shall shortly turn.
The second point to note is that the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (see 
13.3
) would
now regulate the validity of the exclusion clause found in the contract between the
parties in 
L’Estrange
. But at the time at which 
L’Estrange
 
was decided the court did not
have the power at common law to strike down exclusion clauses on the ground that they
were unreasonable or unfair. In so far as the criticisms of 
L’Estrange
 
are based on the
unfairness of the result, it can be argued that any such unfairness is best addressed by
giving to the courts the power to control unreasonable or unfair terms and not by
modifying the rule that a party is bound by his own signature.
The third point relates to the criticisms that have been levelled against the decision in
L’Estrange
. Maugham LJ expressed his regret at the outcome but was of the view that
he was bound by authority so to conclude. Others have challenged the view that the
court was bound to decide as it did and, in doing so, have invoked some of the cases
discussed in 
Chapter 2
 
(see 
2.2
, 
2.3
, and 
2.4
) concerned with the objective approach
adopted by the courts 
when seeking to ascertain whether or not the parties have reached
agreement. In his article ‘Signature, Consent, and the Rule in 
L’Estrange
 
v. 
Graucob
’
[1973] 
CLJ
 
104, JR Spencer has this to say of 
L’Estrange
 
(at pp. 114–115):
When Miss L’Estrange signed the order form on which were written various terms, she gave the appearance of
agreeing to everything that was written on the document. To borrow the words from 
Smith
 
v. 
Hughes
 
itself, she
so conducted herself ‘that a reasonable man would believe that she was assenting to the terms proposed by the
other party’. It would usually follow from this that she was bound by her apparent consent to all those terms.
However, a person is not bound by apparent consent where the other party knew that his mind did not go with
his apparent consent, or where the other party is responsible for the mistake which has been made. Didn’t the
facts of the case bring Miss L’Estrange within the scope of these exceptions to apparent consent?
The order form which Graucob Ltd provided seems to have been drawn up in a most confusing way.
Maugham LJ said ‘ … I could wish that the contract had been in a simpler and more usual form. It is
unfortunate that the important clause excluding conditions and warranties is in such small print’. Not only was
the clause printed in small print, but it was also printed on brown paper, which must have made the small print
even harder to read. The general layout of the form also appears to have been confusing, too, the exemption
clause being in a part of the document where it easily escaped notice. Then was this not one of those cases
where although A apparently consented to B’s terms, he did so because B had earlier confused him as to what
those terms should be? In principle, the case is surely the same as 
Scriven
 
v. 
Hindley
, where A was allowed to
deny his apparent consent to a contract to buy tow, because the auction catalogue had been confusing, and had
contributed to form A’s belief that he was offering to buy, not tow, but hemp.
Perhaps Miss L’Estrange could have gone even further than this, and also denied her apparent consent to
the exemption clause on the ground that the company either knew or ought to have known that her mind did
not go with her apparent consent. Why did Graucob Ltd use order forms printed on brown paper containing
obscure exemption clauses in minute print in unexpected places? Was it because it knew that if it said what it
meant more plainly, its customers would understand the document they were being asked to sign, and would
refuse to do so? Who in their right mind would sign a document headed ‘I agree to pay for your goods even if
they are useless, and not to sue you even if they injure me?’ Even if Graucob Ltd had used the words it did use
—‘any express or implied condition, statement or warranty, statutory or otherwise, not stated herein is hereby
excluded’—Miss L’Estrange might still have refused to sign if those words had been printed clearly where they
could be seen. She would not have understood them, of course, but … she might have asked the salesmen what
the words meant. If the salesman had explained correctly, presumably she would not have signed. If he had
explained incorrectly, then the company would have misrepresented the legal effect of the form, and … would
have been unable to rely on the exemption clause.
The truth is that whatever may have been Graucob Ltd’s intentions disreputable companies put harsh
exemption clauses in minute print in order to ‘put one over’ people like Miss L’Estrange. Then why should
people in her position not be allowed to deny their apparent consent to the clause because the company either
knew or ought to have known that their mind did not go with their apparent consent?
Yet the Divisional Court, which felt sorry for Miss L’Estrange, did not allow her to deny her assent to the
exemption clause by alleging either that Graucob Ltd were to blame for her mistake, as in 
Scriven
 
v. 
Hindley
[see 
2.4
], or that they had actual or constructive knowledge of the mistake she had made, as in 
Hartog
 
v. 
Colin
and Shields
 
[see 
2.3
]. Why not? …
The reason why the [court in 
L’Estrange
 
v. 
Graucob
] … refused to admit the usual defences based on 
Smith
v. 
Hughes
, and restricted the range of available defences to fraud, misrepresentation and 
non est factum
,
appears to be that [the court] thought that there was something special about a signed document. Where there
is a signed document, the courts thought that some kind of magic operated to take the contract out of the usual
rules that govern the formation of contracts, and to bind the signatory almost absolutely.
An approach similar to that advocated in the penultimate paragraph of Professor
Spencer’s article was adopted by the Court of Appeal of Ontario in 
Tilden Rent-A-Car Co
v. 
Clendinning
 
(1978) 83 DLR (3d) 400. The defendant, Mr Clendinning, rented a car
from Tilden Rent-A-Car at Vancouver airport. He was asked whether or not he wished to
have additional insurance cover and he replied that he did. He was given a form to sign
which he signed without reading, as would have been apparent to the clerk. The
question for the court was whether or not the defendant was bound by an exemption
clause in the policy which had the effect of imposing liability upon him for damage done
to the car. The Court of Appeal concluded that he was not bound by the term.
In ordinary commercial practice where there is frequently a sense of formality in the transaction, and where
there is a full opportunity for the parties to consider the terms of the proposed contract submitted for signature,
it might well be safe to assume that the party who attaches his signature to the contract intends by so doing to
acknowledge his acquiescence to its terms, and that the other party entered into the contract upon that belief.
This can hardly be said, however, where the contract is entered into in circumstances such as were present in
this case.
A transaction, such as this one, is invariably carried out in a hurried, informal manner. The speed with
which the transaction is completed is said to be one of the attractive features of the services provided.
[The judge then noted that the clauses upon which Tilden Rent-A-Car relied were inconsistent with the
essential purpose of the contract into which Mr Clendinning had entered, and that in such circumstances Tilden
Rent-A-Car was required to do something more to draw the attention of the terms to Mr Clendinning than
simply handing them over to be signed and continued.]
In modern commercial practice, many standard form printed documents are signed without being read or
understood. In many cases the parties seeking to rely on the terms of the contract know or ought to know that
the signature of a party to the contract does not represent the true intention of the signer, and that the party
signing is unaware of the stringent and onerous provisions which the standard form contains. Under such
circumstances, I am of the opinion that the party seeking to rely on such terms should not be able to do so in the
absence of first having taken reasonable measures to draw such terms to the attention of the other party, and, in
the absence of such reasonable measures, it is not necessary for the party denying knowledge of such terms to
prove either fraud, misrepresentation or non est factum.
… Tilden Rent-A-Car took no steps to alert Mr Clendinning to the onerous provisions in the standard form
contract presented by it. The clerk could not help but have known that Mr Clendinning had not in fact read the
contract before signing it. Indeed the form of the contract itself with the important provisions on the reverse
side and in very small type would discourage even the most cautious customer from endeavouring to read and
understand it. Under such circumstances, it was not open to Tilden Rent-A-Car to rely on those clauses …
The orthodox analysis of English law is that the exceptions to the rule that a person is
bound by his signature are much narrower in scope than that recognized by the Court of
Appeal of Ontario. Two exceptions were acknowledged on the facts of 
L’Estrange
 
itself
and a third has been recognized subsequently. The first exception arises where the party
signing the document can invoke the defence of 
non est factum
. The scope of this
defence is discussed in more detail in a subsequent chapter (see 
16.8
). Here it suffices to
note that it is a defence that operates within narrow confines. In essence it allows a party
to deny that the document which he has signed is his deed on the basis that he was
unable, through no fault of his own, to have any real understanding of a document,
without being given an explanation of it. The causes of the lack of understanding can be
‘defective education, illness or innate incapacity’ (see 
Saunders
 
v. 
Anglia Building
Society
 
[1971] AC 1004, 1016).
The second exception arises where the person is induced to sign the document as the
result of a misrepresentation made to him. In 
Curtis
 
v. 
Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing
Co Ltd
 
[1951] 1 KB 805 the plaintiff took a white satin wedding dress to the defendants
for cleaning. She was asked to sign a document that contained a clause which stated that
the dress was ‘accepted on condition that the company is not liable for any damage
howsoever arising’. Prior to signing the document the plaintiff inquired why it was that
she was being asked to sign the document. She was told that it was because the
defendants did not accept liability for damage done to beads or sequins on the dress.
The plaintiff then signed the document but did not take the time to read its terms. When
the dress was returned to her there was a stain on it. She brought a claim against the
defendants who attempted to rely on the exclusion clause by way of defence. The Court
of Appeal held that they could not do so in the light of the representation made by the
defendant’s employee prior to the plaintiff signing the document. Denning LJ stated (at
pp. 808–809):
If the party affected signs a written document, knowing it to be a contract which governs the relations between
him and the other party, his signature is irrefragable evidence of his assent to the whole contract, including the
exempting clauses, unless the signature is shown to be obtained by fraud or misrepresentation: see 
L’Estrange
v. 
Graucob
. … What is a sufficient misrepresentation for this purpose? …
In my opinion, any behaviour by words or conduct is sufficient to be a misrepresentation if it is such as to
mislead the other party about the existence or extent of the exemption. If it conveys a false impression, that is
enough. If the false impression is created knowingly, it is a fraudulent misrepresentation; if it is created
unwittingly, it is an innocent misrepresentation. But either is sufficient to disentitle the creator of it to the
benefit of the exemption. It was held in 
R
 
v. 
Kylsant (Lord)
 
[1932] 1 KB 442 that a misrepresentation might be
literally true but practically false, not because of what is said, but because of what it left unsaid. In short,
because of what it implied. This is as true of an innocent misrepresentation as it is of a fraudulent
misrepresentation. When one party puts forward a printed form for signature, failure by him to draw attention
to the existence or extent of the exemption clause may in some circumstances convey the impression that there
is no exemption at all, or, any rate, not so wide an exemption as that which is in fact contained in the document.
The present case is a good illustration. The customer said in evidence:
‘When I was asked to sign the document I asked why. The assistant said I was to accept any responsibility
for damage to beads and sequins. I did not read it all before I signed it.’
In those circumstances, by failing to draw attention to the width of the exemption clause, the assistant created
the false impression that the exemption clause related to the beads and 
sequins only, and that it did not extend
to the material of which the dress was made. It was done perfectly innocently, but, nevertheless, a false
impression was created … [I]t was a sufficient misrepresentation to disentitle the cleaners from relying on the
exemption, except in regard to the beads and sequins.
The third exception, acknowledged in 
Grogan
 
v. 
Robin Meredith Plant Hire
 
[1996] CLC
1127, is that the document which has been signed must have been a document which
purports to have contractual effect and not an administrative document, such as a time-
sheet. The latter does not purport to constitute the contract; rather, it records or gives
effect to a part of the contract that has already been concluded (for example, by
recording the number of hours for which a piece of machinery has been hired out, so
that the price payable can be calculated). Whether a document amounts to a contractual
document or not is a decision that must be reached in the light of all the facts and
circumstances of the case.
A more controversial question is whether or not there is a wider exception in English
law, similar in scope to that recognized in 
Tilden Rent-A-Car Co
 
v. 
Clendinning
. This
could be done by extending the rule relating to the incorporation by notice of onerous or
unusual terms (on which see 
Interfoto Picture Library Ltd
 
v. 
Stiletto Visual
Programmes Ltd
 
[1989] QB 433, 
9.3
) to cases in which the document has been signed
by the party who is claiming that he is not bound by its terms. The courts have been
reluctant to extend the 
Interfoto
 
rule to cases of signature but, importantly, they have
not ruled out the possibility that there may be exceptional cases in which the rule may
be so extended (see, for example, 
Cargill International Trading Pte Ltd v Uttam Galva
Steels Ltd
 
[2019] EWHC 476 (Comm), [89] where it was recognized that there may be
‘exceptional cases in which the signing party was under undue pressure or had no real
opportunity to read and consider the contract before signing’). If there is such an
exception its requirements are not satisfied simply by proof that the term is onerous or
unreasonable (
Higgins & Co Lawyers Ltd v Evans
 
[2019] EWHC 2809 (QB), [2020] 1
WLR 141, [78]). It is necessary to go further and to establish the ‘exceptional’ or
‘extreme’ circumstance that the party signing the document did not, for some legitimate
reason, read the document prior to signing it and that this fact was known to the other
party to the transaction.
Should English law recognize such an exceptional case? It is suggested that the courts
should be reluctant to do so. Why should this be so? The answer lies in the significance
that is attached to a signature. Why do we generally treat a signature as conclusive?
Professor Atiyah has stated (‘Form and Substance in Contract Law’ in 
Essays on
Contract
 
(Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 109) that:
[a] signature is, and is widely recognized even by the general public as, a formal device, and its value would be
greatly reduced if it could not be treated as a conclusive ground of contractual liability at least in all ordinary
circumstances.
A signature provides a measure of certainty and it is frequently relied upon by third
parties. As Moore-Bick LJ observed in 
Peekay Intermark Ltd
 
v. 
Australia and New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd
 
[2006] EWCA Civ 386, [2006] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 511 (at [43])
the rule in 
L’Estrange
 
is ‘an important principle of English law which underpins the
whole of commercial life; any erosion of it would have serious repercussions’.
New forms of technology may, however, challenge this perspective of the value of a
signature. Will an electronic signature count as a signature for the purposes of the rule
in 
L’Estrange
? If it does, will the courts continue to follow 
L’Estrange
 
or will they adopt
the approach taken in 
Clendinning
? In time the English courts may well go down the
road taken by the Canadian courts. But it is suggested that a preferable approach would
be to adhere to the rule (as was done by the High Court of Australia in 
Toll (FGCT) Pty
Ltd
 
v. 
Alphapharm Pty Ltd
 
(2004) 219 CLR 165, discussed in greater detail in the 
online resources
 
which support this book), subject to its existing exceptions, and, if
necessary, to give to the courts greater power to deal with unreasonable terms contained
in contracts. In this way the value of a signature as a formal device would be retained,
but the courts would be given the power to deal with what seems to be the real evil in
these cases, namely the presence of unfair terms in contracts.
9.3
 
Incorporation by Notice
A party who wishes to incorporate terms into a contract by giving his contracting party
notice of them must satisfy three requirements. First, notice must have been given at or
before the time of contracting. This may require the courts to apply the rules of offer and
acceptance in order to ascertain the moment in time at which the contract was
concluded. Two cases illustrate this point. The first is 
Olley
 
v. 
Marlborough Court Ltd
[1949] 1 KB 532. Here the notice was located in a hotel bedroom. It was held that it was
ineffective to exclude liability towards a guest of the hotel on the basis that the contract
between the hotel and the guest had been concluded before she set foot in the hotel
bedroom. It was therefore too late to be effective. A second example is provided by the
case of 
Thornton
 
v. 
Shoe Lane Parking
 
[1971] 2 QB 163. There the exemption clause was
to be found inside a car park. The Court of Appeal held that the defendants had not
taken reasonable steps to bring the clause to the attention of the customer (this aspect of
the case is analysed by Bingham LJ in his judgment in 
Interfoto Picture Library Ltd
 
v.
Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd
 
[1989] QB 433, later in this section). But Lord Denning
also held that the clause was too late to be incorporated into the contract. The car park
was described as a ‘multi-storey automatic car park’ and a ticket was issued to a
customer when he drove up to the machine at the entrance to the car park. Lord
Denning held that the contract was concluded at the moment of entry into the car park
so that the notice contained inside the car park and the terms printed on the ticket were
too late to be included. He analysed the nature of the transaction between the parties in
the following terms (at p. 169):
The customer pays his money and gets a ticket. He cannot refuse it. He cannot get his money back. He may
protest to the machine, even swear at it. But it will remain unmoved. He is committed beyond recall. He was
committed at the very moment when he put his money into the machine. The contract was concluded at that
time. It can be translated into offer and acceptance in this way: the offer is made when the proprietor of the
machine holds it out as being ready to receive the money. The acceptance takes place when the customer puts
his money into the slot. The terms of the offer are contained in the notice placed on or near the machine stating
what is offered for the money. The customer is bound by those terms as long as they are sufficiently brought to
his notice before-hand, but not otherwise. He is not bound by the terms printed on the ticket if they differ from
the notice, because the ticket comes too late. The contract has already been made.
The second requirement is that the terms must have been contained or referred to in a
document that was intended to have contractual effect. So, for example, where the terms
are contained in a document that is a receipt rather than a contractual document, the
receipt will not be effective to incorporate the terms into the contract (see, for example,
Chapelton
 
v. 
Barry UDC
 
[1940] 1 KB 532 where a ticket given to someone who hired a
deckchair was held not to be a contractual document and so was not effective to give the
hirer notice of the terms).
The third requirement is that reasonable steps must have been taken to bring the terms
to the attention of the other party. This requirement has generated a considerable
amount of case-law which dates back to the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Parker
 
v.
South Eastern Railway
 
(1877) 2 CPD 416. This case-law was helpfully reviewed by the
Court of Appeal in the following case:
INTERFOTO PICTURE LIBRARY LTD V. STILETTO
VISUAL PROGRAMMES LTD
[1989] QB 433, Court of Appeal
The defendant advertising agency wanted some photographs for a presentation for
a client. On 5 March 1984 Mr Beeching, a director of the agency, telephoned the
plaintiffs who ran a library of photographic transparencies and inquired whether
they had any photographs of the 1950s which would be suitable for the defendants’
purpose. The plaintiffs responded that they would look into the matter and, later the
same day, they sent forty-seven transparencies to the defendants in a jiffy bag
together with a delivery note which contained a number of terms. The delivery note
stated that the date for the return of the transparencies was 19 March 1984. At the
bottom of the delivery note, under the heading ‘Conditions’ which was ‘fairly
prominently printed in capitals’, there were nine conditions, printed in four columns.
Condition 2 provided:
‘All transparencies must be returned to us within 14 days from the date of posting/delivery/collection. A
holding fee of £5 plus VAT per day will be charged for each transparency which is retained by you longer
than the said period of 14 days save where a copyright licence is granted or we agree a longer period in
writing with you.’
On receipt of the transparencies Mr Beeching telephoned the plaintiffs to say that
the defendants were very impressed with the speed of the service, that one or two
of the transparencies could be of interest and that they would get back to the
plaintiffs on the matter. The defendants did not, however, use the transparencies
for the presentation. Instead they put them to one side and forgot about them. The
plaintiffs attempted to contact Mr Beeching on 20 and 23 March but were only able
to speak to his secretary. In the event, the transparencies were not returned until 2
April. The plaintiffs then sent an invoice to the defendants for £3,783.50, which
represented the holding charge in respect of their retention of the transparencies.
The defendants refused to pay. The plaintiffs brought an action to recover the
£3,783.50. The trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiffs. The defendants
appealed to the Court of Appeal where it was held that condition 2 had not been
incorporated into the contract. The defendants’ appeal was therefore allowed and
the defendants were ordered to pay £3.50 per transparency per week on a
quantum meruit basis for the retention of the transparencies beyond a reasonable
period, which was fixed at fourteen days from the date of their receipt by the
defendants.
Dillon LJ
[set out the facts and continued]
Condition 2 of these plaintiffs’ conditions is in my judgment a very onerous
clause. The defendants could not conceivably have known, if their attention was
not drawn to the clause, that the plaintiffs were proposing to charge a ‘holding fee’
for the retention of the transparencies at such a very high and exorbitant rate.
At the time of the ticket cases in the last century it was notorious that people
hardly ever troubled to read printed conditions on a ticket or delivery note or similar
document. That remains the case now. In the intervening years the printed
conditions have tended to become more and more complicated and more and
more one-sided in favour of the party who is imposing them, but the other parties, if
they notice that there are printed conditions at all, generally still tend to assume
that such conditions are only concerned with ancillary matters of form and are not
of importance. In the ticket cases the courts held that the common law required
that reasonable steps be taken to draw the other parties’ attention to the printed
conditions or they would not be part of the contract. It is, in my judgment, a logical
development of the common law into modern conditions that it should be held, as it
was in 
Thornton
 
v. 
Shoe Lane Parking Ltd
 
[1971] 2 QB 163, that, if one condition in
a set of printed conditions is particularly onerous or unusual, the party seeking to
enforce it must show that that particular condition was fairly brought to the attention
of the other party.
In the present case, nothing whatever was done by the plaintiffs to draw the
defendants’ attention particularly to condition 2; it was merely one of four columns’
width of conditions printed across the foot of the delivery note. Consequently
condition 2 never, in my judgment, became part of the contract between the
parties.
I would therefore allow this appeal and reduce the amount of the judgment
which the judge awarded against the defendants to the amount which he would
have awarded on a quantum meruit on his alternative findings, i.e. the reasonable
charge of £3.50 per transparency per week for the retention of the transparencies
beyond a reasonable period, which he fixed at 14 days from the date of their
receipt by the defendants.
Bingham LJ
In many civil law systems, and perhaps in most legal systems outside the common
law world, the law of obligations recognises and enforces an overriding principle
that in making and carrying out contracts parties should act in good faith. This does
not simply mean that they should not deceive each other, a principle which any
legal system must recognise; its effect is perhaps most aptly conveyed by such
metaphorical colloquialisms as ‘playing fair’, ‘coming clean’ or ‘putting one’s cards
face upwards on the table’. It is in essence a principle of fair and open dealing. In
such a forum it might, I think, be held on the facts of this case that the plaintiffs
were under a duty in all fairness to draw the defendants’ attention specifically to
the high price payable if the transparencies were not returned in time and, when
the 14 days had expired, to point out to the defendants the high cost of continued
failure to return them.
English law has, characteristically, committed itself to no such overriding
principle but has developed piecemeal solutions in response to demonstrated
problems of unfairness. Many examples could be given. Thus equity has
intervened to strike down unconscionable bargains. Parliament has stepped in to
regulate the imposition of exemption clauses and the form of certain hire-purchase
agreements. The common law also has made its contribution, by holding that
certain classes of contract require the utmost good faith, by treating 
as
irrecoverable what purport to be agreed estimates of damage but are in truth a
disguised penalty for breach, and in many other ways.
The well-known cases on sufficiency of notice are in my view properly to be
read in this context. At one level they are concerned with a question of pure
contractual analysis, whether one party has done enough to give the other notice
of the incorporation of a term in the contract. At another level they are concerned
with a somewhat different question, whether it would in all the circumstances be
fair (or reasonable) to hold a party bound by any conditions or by a particular
condition of an unusual and stringent nature.
In the leading case of 
Parker
 
v. 
South Eastern Railway Co
 
(1877) 2 CPD 416,
Baggallay LJ plainly thought on the facts that the plaintiffs were right, Bramwell LJ
that they were wrong; Mellish LJ thought that there had been a misdirection and
there should be a re-trial, a view in which the other members of the court
concurred. The judgments deserve to be re-read. Mellish LJ said, at pp. 422–423:
‘Now, I am of opinion that we cannot lay down, as a matter of law, either that the plaintiff was bound or
that he was not bound by the conditions printed on the ticket, from the mere fact that he knew there was
writing on the ticket, but did not know that the writing contained conditions. I think there may be cases in
which a paper containing writing is delivered by one party to another in the course of a business
transaction, where it would be quite reasonable that the party receiving it should assume that the writing
contained in it no condition, and should put it in his pocket unread. … The railway company, as it seems
to me, must be entitled to make some assumptions respecting the person who deposits luggage with
them: I think they are entitled to assume that he can read, and that he understands the English
language, and that he pays such attention to what he is about as may be reasonably expected from a
person in such a transaction as that of depositing luggage in a cloak-room. The railway company must,
however, take mankind as they find them, and if what they do is sufficient to inform people in general that
the ticket contains conditions, I think that a particular plaintiff ought not to be in a better position than
other persons on account of his exceptional ignorance or stupidity or carelessness. But if what the
railway company do is not sufficient to convey to the minds of people in general that the ticket contains
conditions, then they have received goods on deposit without obtaining the consent of the persons
depositing them to the conditions limiting their liability.’
Baggallay LJ’s analytical approach was somewhat similar. He said, at pp. 425–
426:
‘Now as regards each of the plaintiffs, if at the time when he accepted the ticket, he, either by actual
examination of it, or by reason of previous experience, or from any other cause, was aware of the terms
or purport or effect of the endorsed conditions, it can hardly be doubted that he became bound by them. I
think also that he would be equally bound if he was aware or had good reason to believe that there were
upon the ticket statements intended to affect the relative rights of himself and the company, but
intentionally or negligently abstained from ascertaining whether there were any such, or from making
himself acquainted with their purport. But I do not think that in the absence of any such knowledge or
information, or good reason for belief, he was under any obligation to examine the ticket with the view of
ascertaining whether there were any such statements or conditions upon it.’
Both Mellish LJ and Baggallay LJ were, as it seems to me distinguishing the case
in which it would be fair to hold a party bound from the case in which it would not.
But this approach is made more explicit in the strongly worded judgment of
Bramwell LJ, at p. 427:
‘The plaintiffs have sworn that they did not know that the printing was the contract, and we must act as
though that was true and we believed it, at least as far as entering the verdict 
for the defendants is
concerned. Does this make any difference? The plaintiffs knew of the printed matter. Both admit they
knew it concerned them in some way, though they said they did not know what it was; yet neither
pretends that he knew or believed it was not the contract. Neither pretends he thought it had nothing to
do with the business in hand; that he thought it was an advertisement or other matter unconnected with
his deposit of a parcel at the defendants’ cloak-room. They admit that, for anything they knew or
believed, it might be, only they did not know or believe it was, the contract. Their evidence is very much
that they did not think, or, thinking, did not care about it. Now they claim to charge the company, and to
have the benefit of their own indifference. Is this just? Is it reasonable? Is it the way in which any other
business is allowed to be conducted? Is it even allowed to a man to “think”, “judge”, “guess”, “chance” a
matter, without informing himself when he can, and then when his “thought”, “judgment”, “guess”, or
“chance” turns out wrong or unsuccessful, claim to impose a burthen or duty on another which he could
not have done had he informed himself as he might?’
He continued in the same vein, at p. 428:
‘Has not the giver of the paper a right to suppose that the receiver is content to deal on the terms in the
paper? What more can be done? Must he say, “Read that?” As I have said, he does so in effect when he
puts it into the other’s hands. The truth is, people are content to take these things on trust. They know
that there is a form which is always used—they are satisfied it is not unreasonable, because people do
not usually put unreasonable terms into their contracts. If they did, then dealing would soon be stopped.
Besides, unreasonable practices would be known. The very fact of not looking at the paper shews that
this confidence exists. It is asked: What if there was some unreasonable condition, as for instance to
forfeit £1,000 if the goods were not removed in 48 hours? Would the depositor be bound? I might content
myself by asking: Would he be, if he were told “our conditions are on this ticket”, and he did not read
them. In my judgment, he would not be bound in either case. I think there is an implied understanding
that there is no condition unreasonable to the knowledge of the party tendering the document and not
insisting on its being read—no condition not relevant to the matter in hand. I am of opinion, therefore,
that the plaintiffs, having notice of the printing, were in the same situation as though the porter had said,
“Read that, it concerns the matter in hand”; that if the plaintiffs did not read it, they were as much bound
as if they had read it and had not objected.’
This is not a simple contractual analysis whether an offer has been made and
accepted …
J Spurling Ltd
 
v. 
Bradshaw
 
[1956] 1 WLR 461 concerned an exemption clause
in a warehousing contract. The case is now remembered for the observations of
Denning LJ, at p. 466:
‘This brings me to the question whether this clause was part of the contract. Mr Sofer urged us to hold
that the warehousemen did not do what was reasonably sufficient to give notice of the conditions within
Parker
 
v. 
South Eastern Railway Co
 
2 CPD 416. I quite agree that the more unreasonable a clause is,
the greater the notice which must be given of it. Some clauses which I have seen would need to be
printed in red ink on the face of the document with a red hand pointing to it before the notice could be
held to be sufficient.’
Here, therefore, is made explicit what Bramwell LJ had perhaps foreshadowed,
that what would be good notice of one condition would not be notice of another.
The reason is that the more outlandish the clause the greater the notice which the
other party, if he is to be bound must in all fairness be given …
Lastly I would mention 
Thornton
 
v. 
Shoe Lane Parking Ltd
. [1971] 2 QB 163.
Lord Denning MR said, at pp. 169–170:
‘Assuming, however, that an automatic machine is a booking clerk in disguise—so that the old fashioned
ticket cases still apply to it. We then have to go back to the three questions put by Mellish LJ in 
Parker
 
v.
South Eastern Railway Co
, 2 CPD 416, 423, subject to this qualification: Mellish LJ used the word
“conditions” in the plural, whereas it would be more apt to use the word “condition” in the singular, as
indeed the Lord Justice himself did on the next page. After all, the only condition that matters for this
purpose is the exempting condition. It is no use telling the customer that the ticket is issued subject to
some “conditions” or other, without more: for he may reasonably regard “conditions” in general as merely
regulatory, and not as taking away his rights, unless the exempting condition is drawn specifically to his
attention. (Alternatively, if the plural “conditions” is used, it would be better prefaced with the word
“exempting”, because the exempting conditions are the only conditions that matter for this purpose.)
Telescoping the three questions, they come to this: the customer is bound by the exempting condition if
he knows that the ticket is issued subject to it; or, if the company did what was reasonably sufficient to
give him notice of it.
Mr Machin admitted here that the company did not do what was reasonably sufficient to give Mr
Thornton notice of the exempting condition. That admission was properly made. I do not pause to inquire
whether the exempting condition is void for unreasonableness. All I say is that it is so wide and so
destructive of rights that the court should not hold any man bound by it unless it is drawn to his attention
in the most explicit way. It is an instance of what I had in mind in 
J Spurling Ltd
 
v. 
Bradshaw
 
[1956] 1
WLR 461, 466. In order to give sufficient notice, it would need to be printed in red ink with a red hand
pointing to it—or something equally startling.’
The judgment of Megaw LJ was to similar effect …
The tendency of the English authorities has, I think, been to look at the nature
of the transaction in question and the character of the parties to it; to consider what
notice the party alleged to be bound was given of the particular condition said to
bind him; and to resolve whether in all the circumstances it is fair to hold him
bound by the condition in question. This may yield a result not very different from
the civil law principle of good faith, at any rate so far as the formation of the
contract is concerned.
Turning to the present case, I am satisfied … that no contract was made on the
telephone when the defendants made their initial request. I am equally satisfied
that no contract was made on delivery of the transparencies to the defendants
before the opening of the jiffy bag in which they were contained. Once the jiffy bag
was opened and the transparencies taken out with the delivery note, it is in my
judgment an inescapable inference that the defendants would have recognised the
delivery note as a document of a kind likely to contain contractual terms and would
have seen that there were conditions printed in small but visible lettering on the
face of the document. To the extent that the conditions so displayed were common
form or usual terms regularly encountered in this business, I do not think the
defendants could successfully contend that they were not incorporated into the
contract.
The crucial question in the case is whether the plaintiffs can be said fairly and
reasonably to have brought condition 2 to the notice of the defendants. The judge
made no finding on the point, but I think that it is open to this court to draw an
inference from the primary findings which he did make. In my opinion the plaintiffs
did not do so. They delivered 47 transparencies, which was a number the
defendants had not specifically asked for. Condition 2 contained a daily rate per
transparency after the initial period of 14 days many times greater than 
was usual
or (so far as the evidence shows) heard of. For these 47 transparencies there was
to be a charge for each day of delay of £235 plus value added tax. The result
would be that a venial period of delay, as here, would lead to an inordinate liability.
The defendants are not to be relieved of that liability because they did not read the
condition, although doubtless they did not; but in my judgment they are to be
relieved because the plaintiffs did not do what was necessary to draw this
unreasonable and extortionate clause fairly to their attention. I would accordingly
allow the defendants’ appeal and substitute for the judge’s award the sum which
he assessed upon the alternative basis of quantum meruit.
In reaching the conclusion I have expressed I would not wish to be taken as
deciding that condition 2 was not challengeable as a disguised penalty clause. This
point was not argued before the judge nor raised in the notice of appeal. It was
accordingly not argued before us. I have accordingly felt bound to assume,
somewhat reluctantly, that condition 2 would be enforceable if fully and fairly
brought to the defendants’ attention.
Commentary
It is important to get the focus of attention right. The focus is not upon the recipient of
the notice. The test applied by the court is not whether the recipient has read the terms
or taken reasonable steps to discover their existence (although where the recipient has
actual knowledge of the existence of the terms it would appear that, in principle, he is
bound by them: 
Parker
 
v. 
South Eastern Railway
 
(1877) 2 CPD 416, 421). Instead, the
courts focus attention upon the party relying upon the terms and ask themselves
whether that party has taken reasonable steps to bring notice of the term or terms to the
attention of the other party. The case-law can be traced back to the old ‘ticket cases’, of
which 
Parker
 
v. 
South Eastern Railway
 
(1877) 2 CPD 416 is a leading example, where
the issue between the parties was generally whether or not a sweeping exclusion clause
had been incorporated into the contract with the passenger.
In determining whether or not reasonable steps have been taken in order to draw the
term to the attention of the other party, the courts have regard to obvious factors such as
the location of the notice and its prominence. A notice which is located on the back of a
document is unlikely to be incorporated in the absence of a reference on the front of the
document alerting the reader to the presence of terms, or a reference to terms, on the
back (see 
Henderson
 
v. 
Stevenson
 
(1875) LR 2 HL (Sc) 470). Similarly, a notice that has
been obliterated by a stamp is unlikely to be incorporated (
Sugar
 
v. 
London, Midland
and Scottish Railway Co
 
[1941] 1 All ER 172). On the other hand, where the term, or the
reference to the terms, is located prominently on the front of the document, then the
likelihood is that the term will be incorporated (
Thompson
 
v. 
London, Midland and
Scottish Railway Co Ltd
 
[1930] 1 KB 41). Similarly, reference to terms on a website may
amount to the giving of reasonable notice (
Impala Warehousing and Logistics
(Shanghai) Co Ltd
 
v. 
Wanxiang Resources (Singapore) Pte Ltd
 
[2015] EWHC 25
(Comm)).
However, as the judgment of Bingham LJ in 
Interfoto
 
makes clear, the inquiry
undertaken by the courts in this connection is no mere mechanical exercise. It requires
the court to evaluate the nature of the term that one party is seeking to incorporate into
the contract. The more onerous or unusual the term, the greater the steps that must be
taken in order to draw its existence to the other party’s attention. This principle is
applicable both to consumer and to commercial contracts (
Kaye
 
v. 
Nu Skin UK Ltd
[2009] EWHC 3509 (Ch), [2011] 1 Lloyd’s 
Rep 40, [37]). Bingham LJ in his judgment
endeavours to demonstrate that this approach has a sure foundation in the authorities.
Its foundation in terms of principle is perhaps more debatable. Why seek to differentiate
between different terms in relation to their incorporation into a contract? If the law’s
concern is with the unfairness of the term itself, would this not be better expressed by
conferring on the court a direct power to regulate unfair terms? One answer to this
question is that the law does not presently confer upon the courts such a broad power
and, in its absence, the courts have to make use of what might be said to be the ‘second-
best alternative’ of regulating the incorporation of terms into contracts. While the Unfair
Contract Terms Act 1977 does confer a limited power upon courts to regulate certain
clauses which seek to exclude or restrict liability (on which see 
13.3
), the Act does not
extend to the type of clause in issue in 
Interfoto
. In the absence of a power directly to
control the substantive content of the clause, the court chose to regulate it by concluding
that it had not been incorporated into the contract.
Post-
Interfoto
 
the courts have had some difficulty in identifying which terms are
‘onerous’ or ‘unusual’ and which are not and, as a result, the authorities ‘do not always
agree’ (
Goodlife Foods Ltd
 
v. 
Hall Fire Protection Ltd
 
[2018] EWCA Civ 1371, [2018]
BLR 491, [33]). The hurdle to be overcome in terms of showing that a term is ‘onerous’
or ‘unusual’ is a high one (
Bates
 
v. 
Post Office Ltd
 
[2019] EWHC 606 (QB), [979]). It
should be noted that the term need not be ‘onerous’ in order to attract this more
rigorous scrutiny. It suffices that it is ‘unusual’. Presumably, therefore, a party who
changes his terms in significant respects may be under an obligation to take greater
steps to draw these changes to the attention of the other party. Two cases illustrate the
difficulties that the courts are currently experiencing.
The first is the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
AEG (UK) Ltd
 
v. 
Logic Resource Ltd
[1996] CLC 265. The plaintiffs sold goods to the defendants and the defendants in turn
sub-sold them to their customers in Iran. The goods proved to be defective when they
were inspected by the sub-buyers in Iran. Arrangements were made to air freight the
goods back to the plaintiffs’ factory in the UK at a cost of some £4,230, so that the
necessary modifications could be carried out. The defendants refused to pay the £4,230.
The plaintiffs sued to recover the sum on the basis of clause 7.5 of the contract which
stated: ‘the purchaser shall return the defective parts at his own expense to the supplier
immediately upon request by the latter’. One of the issues before the court was whether
or not this term had been incorporated into the contract between the parties and this
depended upon whether or not the term was ‘particularly onerous or unusual’. The
majority, Hirst and Waite LJJ, concluded that it was both ‘extremely onerous … and also
unusual in the absence of any evidence that it is a standard or common term’. The basis
for their conclusion was that the only right available to the purchasers under the
contract in the event of the goods proving to be defective was to exercise their right to
return the goods to the plaintiffs. To append to this right the requirement that the
purchaser pay for the cost of returning the goods was held to be both onerous and
unusual. The position would probably have been different had the purchasers had
available to them a range of rights in the event of the goods being defective. In such a
case a seller might legitimately attach to the exercise of the right to return the goods for
repair a condition that the purchaser meet the cost of returning the goods. Hobhouse LJ
dissented and he did so in forthright terms. He stated:
In my judgment … it is necessary before excluding the incorporation of a clause 
in limine
 
to consider the type of
clause it is. Is it a clause of the type which you would expect to find 
in the printed conditions? If it is, then it is
only in the most exceptional circumstances that a party will be able to say that it was not adequately brought to
his notice by standard words of incorporation. … This case is not analogous to either of the two cases upon
which the appellant founds. The 
Interfoto
 
case involved an extortionate clause which did not relate directly to
the expected rights and obligations of the parties. In the 
Shoe Lane Parking
 
case, it related to personal injuries
and the state of the premises and not to the subject matter of the car parking contract …
Therefore, in my judgment, it is necessary to consider the type of clause, and only if it is a type of clause
which it is not to be expected will be found in the printed conditions referred to then to go on to question its
incorporation. These conditions do include clauses which, in my judgment, do fall foul of the 
Interfoto
principle, but I do not consider that clause 7 comes into that category. In my judgment, it is desirable as a
matter of principle to keep what was said in the 
Interfoto
 
case within its proper bounds. A wide range of clauses
are commonly incorporated into contracts by general words. If it is to be the policy of English law that in every
case those clauses are to be gone through with, in effect, a toothcomb to see whether they were entirely usual
and entirely desirable in the particular contract, then one is completely distorting the contractual relationship
between the parties and the ordinary mechanisms of making contracts. It will introduce uncertainty into the law
of contract.
In the past there may have been a tendency to introduce more strict criteria but this is no longer necessary in
view of the Unfair Contract Terms Act. … and it is under the provisions of that Act that problems of
unreasonable clauses should be addressed and the solution found. In the present case, it is my opinion that the
Act provides the answer to the question which has been raised.
The second case is 
O’Brien
 
v. 
MGN Ltd
 
[2002] CLC 33. The claimant thought that he
had won a prize in a scratchcard game in the defendants’ newspaper. Unfortunately for
him, a mistake had been made by the defendants in that they had failed to notice that a
number of cards had been issued with the winning numbers on them. Instead of there
being two winners of the £50,000 prize, some 1,472 people rang up to claim the prize. In
these circumstances the defendants refused to pay out to all the ‘winners’. They relied
upon rule 5 of the competition rules which provided that, if more prizes were claimed
than were available in any prize category for any reason, a separate draw would then
take place for the prize. The question for the court was whether or not rule 5 had been
incorporated into the contract between the parties. The trial judge found that a contract
was concluded between the parties on 3 July 1995, the day on which the claimant bought
the paper. The offer was contained in the paper that day, and the claimant accepted the
offer when he telephoned the hotline in order to claim his prize. Alongside the
instructions relating to the telephone hotline were the words: ‘Normal Mirror Group
rules apply’. Was this reference to the rules sufficient to incorporate them into the
contract? The Court of Appeal held that it was.
This time the Court of Appeal held that the clause was neither ‘onerous’ nor ‘unusual’. It
was not onerous because it did not seek to impose a burden on the claimant, nor did it
attempt to exclude liability for negligently caused personal injury. It simply deprived
‘the claimant of a windfall for which he has done very little in return’. Nor could it be
said that the clause was ‘unusual’ given that other games and competitions had similar
rules.
Hale LJ concluded (at [23]):
[T]he words ‘onerous or unusual’ are not terms of art. They are simply one way of putting the general
proposition that reasonable steps must be taken to draw the particular term in question to the notice of those
who are bound by it and that more is required in relation to certain terms than to others depending on their
effect. In the particular context of this particular game, I consider that the defendants did just enough to bring
the rules to the claimant’s attention. There was a clear reference to rules on the face of the card he used. There
was a clear reference to rules in the paper containing the offer of a telephone prize. There was evidence that
those rules could be discovered either from the newspaper offices or from back issues of the paper. The claimant
had been able to discover them when the problem arose.
Sir Anthony Evans was much more hesitant. He held that the rule had been
incorporated but only because he was not prepared to interfere with the finding of fact
by the trial judge that the rule had been incorporated. In his view ‘the promise of
significant riches’ deserved more and he stated that a rule which gave the ‘winner’ no
more than a further chance to obtain the prize was sufficiently onerous, if not unusual,
to require greater prominence than was given to this one. While the result in the case
was ultimately unanimous, the judgments nevertheless display a degree of unease about
the meaning of the words ‘onerous or unusual’ and about the application of this test to
any given fact situation.
Where a term is held to be ‘onerous’ or ‘unusual’, what steps are required in order to
incorporate it into the contract? It is not sufficient to bury the term away ‘in the middle
of a raft of small print’ (
Goodlife Foods Ltd
 
v. 
Hall Fire Protection Ltd
 
[2018] EWCA Civ
1371, [2018] BLR 491, [53]). However, the plaintiffs in 
Interfoto
 
did not attempt to hide
their conditions on the delivery note and the defendants were presumably capable of
reading them. Yet condition 2 was not incorporated. What should they have done to
ensure that it was incorporated? In 
J Spurling Ltd
 
v. 
Bradshaw
 
[1956] 1 WLR 461
(referred to in the judgment of Bingham LJ in 
Interfoto
, extracted earlier) Denning LJ
famously referred to the need for a ‘red hand’ pointing to the clause. While his comment
may have made its mark on the judicial memory and on textbook writers, it has not been
translated into commercial practice. Little red hands are not to be found in commercial
contracts in the UK. A more realistic step to take is to put the clause in bold print or
specifically to draw the other party’s attention to the existence of the clause in a letter. A
court may be more likely to conclude that reasonable steps have been taken where there
has been ‘an express acknowledgement in the contractual documents that the terms and
conditions in question were incorporated’ (
Ocean Chemical Transport Inc
 
v. 
Exnor
Craggs Ltd
 
[2000] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 446, 454). This was confirmed by Edwards-Stuart J in
William McIlroy Swindon Ltd
 
v. 
Quinn Insurance Ltd
 
[2010] EWHC 2448 (TCC),
[2011] BLR 136, [42], when he questioned whether the result in 
Interfoto
 
would have
been the same if Interfoto’s secretary had typed onto the delivery note words to the
following effect: ‘The printed terms set out below affect your rights. Before accepting
delivery of the transparencies you are strongly advised to read them to ensure that they
are acceptable.’ While one cannot guarantee that a clause of this type will be effective, it
will almost certainly increase the likelihood that the term will be incorporated into the
contract between the parties.
9.4
 
Incorporation by Course of Dealing and
by Custom
Finally, a term may be incorporated into a contract as a result of a course of dealing
between the parties or as a result of the custom of the trade in which the parties work.
The leading case on incorporation by course of dealing is the following decision of the
House of Lords:
MCCUTCHEON V. DAVID MACBRAYNE LTD
[1964] 1 WLR 430, House of Lords
Mr McCutcheon, the appellant, asked his brother-in-law, Mr McSporran, to arrange
for his car to be shipped from Islay to the mainland. Mr McSporran took the car to
the respondents’ office in Port Askaig where he was quoted a price for a return
journey for the car. He paid the fare and was given a receipt. He delivered the car
into the possession of the respondents. The vessel sank on the journey as a result
of the negligence of the respondents’ employees and the car was a total loss. The
appellant brought an action in negligence against the respondents, who sought to
rely on the terms of an exclusion clause contained in their conditions of carriage.
The usual practice of the respondents was to ask the person sending the goods
to sign a risk note by which the person sending the goods agreed to be bound by
the respondents’ terms and conditions. But on this occasion Mr McSporran was not
asked to sign the risk note and so did not sign one. He gave evidence to the effect
that he had shipped goods before with the respondents and had sometimes been
asked to sign a risk note but had never read it. The appellant himself had
consigned goods with the respondents on four occasions. On three of them he had
been acting on behalf of his employer and on the other occasion he had shipped
his own car. On all four occasions he had signed a risk note. He admitted that he
knew of the existence of the conditions but stated that he was not aware of their
content. The House of Lords held that the respondents’ terms had not been
incorporated into the contract with the consequence that the respondents had not
excluded their liability in negligence.
Lord Reid
The only other ground on which it would seem possible to import these conditions
is that based on a course of dealing. If two parties have made a series of similar
contracts each containing certain conditions, and then they make another without
expressly referring to those conditions it may be that those conditions ought to be
implied. If the officious bystander had asked them whether they had intended to
leave out the conditions this time, both must, as honest men, have said ‘of course
not’. But again the facts here will not support that ground. According to Mr
McSporran, there had been no consistent course of dealing; sometimes he was
asked to sign and sometimes not. And, moreover, he did not know what the
conditions were. This time he was offered an oral contract without any reference to
conditions, and he accepted the offer in good faith.
The respondents also rely on the appellant’s previous knowledge. I doubt
whether it is possible to spell out a course of dealing in his case. In all but one of
the previous cases he had been acting on behalf of his employer in sending a
different kind of goods and he did not know that the respondents always sought to
insist on excluding liability for their own 
negligence. So it cannot be said that when
he asked his agent to make a contract for him he knew that this or, indeed, any
other special term would be included in it. He left his agent a free hand to contract,
and I see nothing to prevent him from taking advantage of the contract which his
agent in fact made.
‘The judicial task is not to discover the actual intentions of each party; it is to decide what each was
reasonably entitled to conclude from the attitude of the other.’ [
WM Gloag on Contract
 
(2nd edn, W
Green, 1929), p. 7.]
In this case I do not think that either party was reasonably bound or entitled to
conclude from the attitude of the other as known to him that these conditions were
intended by the other party to be part of this contract. I would, therefore, allow the
appeal and restore the interlocutor of the Lord Ordinary.
Lord Guest
All that the previous dealings in the present case can show is that the appellant
and his agent knew that the previous practice of the respondents was to impose
special conditions. But knowledge on their part did not and could not by itself
import acceptance by them of these conditions, the exact terms of which they were
unaware, into a contract which was different in character from those in the previous
course of dealing. The practice of the respondents was to insist on a written
contract incorporated in the risk note. On the occasion in question a verbal
contract was made without reference to the conditions.
Lord Devlin
In my opinion, the bare fact that there have been previous dealings between the
parties does not assist the respondents at all. The fact that a man has made a
contract in the same form 99 times (let alone three or four times which are here
alleged) will not of itself affect the 100th contract in which the form is not used.
Previous dealings are relevant only if they prove knowledge of the terms, actual
and not constructive, and assent to them. If a term is not expressed in a contract,
there is only one other way in which it can come into it and that is by implication.
No implication can be made against a party of a term which was unknown to him. If
previous dealings show that a man knew of and agreed to a term on 99 occasions,
there is a basis for saying that it can be imported into the 100th contract without an
express statement. It may or may not be sufficient to justify the importation—that
depends on the circumstances; but at least by proving knowledge the essential
beginning is made. Without knowledge there is nothing …
If a man is given a blank ticket without conditions or any reference to them,
even if he knows in detail what the conditions usually exacted are, he is not, in the
absence of any allegation of fraud or of that sort of mistake for which the law gives
relief, bound by such conditions. It may seem a narrow and artificial line that
divides a ticket that is blank on the back from one that says ‘For conditions see
time-tables’, or something of that sort, that has been held to be enough notice. I
agree that it is an artificial line and one that has little relevance to everyday
conditions. It may be beyond your Lordships’ power to make the artificial line more
natural: but at least you can see that it is drawn fairly for both sides and that there
is not one law for individuals and another for organizations that can issue printed
documents. If the respondents had remembered to issue a risk note in this case,
they would have invited your Lordships to give a curt answer to any complaint by
the appellant. He might say that the terms were unfair and unreasonable, that he
had never voluntarily agreed to them, that it 
was impossible to read or understand
them and that anyway if he had tried to negotiate any change the respondents
would not have listened to him. The respondents would expect him to be told that
he had made his contract and must abide by it. Now the boot is on the other foot. It
is just as legitimate, but also just as vain, for the respondents to say that it was
only a slip on their part, that it is unfair and unreasonable of the appellant to take
advantage of it and that he knew perfectly well that they never carried goods
except on conditions. The law must give the same answer: they must abide by the
contract they made. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. It will
remain unpalatable sauce for both animals until the Legislature, if the Courts
cannot do it, intervenes to secure that when contracts are made in circumstances
in which there is no scope for free negotiation of the terms, they are made upon
terms that are clear, fair and reasonable and settled independently as such. That is
what Parliament has done in the case of carriage of goods by rail and on the high
seas.
Lord Pearce
The defenders rely on the course of dealing. But they are seeking to establish an
oral contract by a course of dealing which always insisted on a written contract. It
is the consistency of a course of conduct which gives rise to the implication that in
similar circumstances a similar contractual result will follow. When the conduct is
not
 
consistent, there is no reason why it should still produce an invariable
contractual result. The defenders having previously offered a written contract, on
this occasion offered an oral one. The pursuer’s agent duly paid the freight for
which he was asked and accepted the oral contract thus offered. This raises no
implication that the conditions of the oral contract must be the same as the
conditions of the written contract would have been had the defenders proffered
one.
Recourse is then sought to knowledge and intention. This is not a case where
there was any bad faith on the part of the pursuer or his agent. Had the pursuer’s
agent snatched at an offer that he knew was not intended, or deliberately taken
advantage of the defenders’ omission to proffer their usual printed form for his
signature, the situation would be different and other considerations would apply.
But neither the pursuer nor his agent gave any thought to conditions. Nor had they
any knowledge that Clause 11 would contain, wrapped in 30 lines of small print
and in language intelligible only to a lawyer or a person of education and
perspicacity, a total exclusion of liability for almost every conceivable act of the
defenders that might damage the pursuer’s goods.
The defenders never intended to offer or make any oral contract on the terms of
the printed conditions. They intended to offer a written contract and by mistake
they offered an oral one. The pursuer was unaware of the mistake. He accepted an
oral contract but he never intended to accept an oral contract on the printed
conditions. He knew that he usually had to sign a form which he supposed
contained some conditions. When he was offered an oral contract without
conditions he accepted with no thought about its terms. Why should such
intentions or knowledge on the part of the contracting parties lead the Court to
create a contract which neither intended? The furthest to which this argument of
the defenders could lead is to the conclusion that the parties were never ad idem;
in which case there was no special contract and the common-law contract prevails.
Some reliance was placed on the fact that the pursuer and his agent were in no
wise misled nor suffered from the absence of the written form since they would not
have read it or paid any attention to it in any event. This argument has a cynical
flavour. It really amounts to saying that because the pursuer would have been
bound by a harsh condition, of which he did not know, if the defenders had taken
the proper legal steps, he should be likewise bound when they neglected to take
those steps. The law inflicts some hardship on ignorant 
or careless plaintiffs who
accept a ticket or sign a printed form in that it holds them bound by printed
conditions which they have not read and of which they know nothing. The reasons
for this are given in 
Parker
 
v. 
South Eastern Railway Company
 
(1877) 2 CPD 416.
If the defenders are to have the benefit of the reasoning in 
Parker’s Case
, they
must take the necessary steps. To decide in the defenders’ favour on the facts of
this case would be a further extension of the protection afforded to defendants by
the ticket cases. Such an extension seems to me very undesirable.

Commentary
In order to establish the existence of a course of dealing there must be both a regularity
and a consistency of dealing between the parties (see also 
Transformers & Rectifiers Ltd
v. 
Needs Ltd
 
[2015] EWHC 269 (TCC), [2015] BLR 336). The downfall of the
respondents in 
McCutcheon
 
was the lack of consistency in their previous dealings with
the appellant and Mr McSporran. But the consistency point should not be taken too far.
Both Lord Guest and Lord Pearce emphasized the fact that the respondents were
attempting to establish an oral contract by reference to a course of dealing which always
required a written contract. This should not have been a decisive factor. A party will
generally only rely on a ‘course of dealing’ argument where he has, for some reason,
failed to comply with his standard practice and, if this failure also had the effect of
negativing the consistency of dealing, incorporation by course of dealing would be
almost an impossibility. So the mere fact that the contract in the present case was an
oral contract should not, of itself, have prevented the respondents from establishing a
course of dealing on the basis of written contracts. The better reason for the failure of
the respondents to incorporate their terms into the contract was given by Lord Reid,
namely that past practice was itself inconsistent. As Mr McSporran stated in evidence,
‘sometimes he was asked to sign [a risk note] and sometimes not’. The extent of the
consistency required must ultimately depend upon the facts of the case. In essence the
courts are looking for a consistency of dealing which is such as to lead both parties
reasonably to believe that the standard terms have been incorporated into their contract.
It can also be difficult to prove a sufficient regularity of dealing, especially where the
contract is concluded between a consumer and a business. In 
Hollier
 
v. 
Rambler Motors
(AMC) Ltd
 
[1972] 2 QB 71 the plaintiff brought an action for damages against the
defendant garage after his car had been badly damaged in a fire at the defendants’
garage. The car had been left with the defendants so that repair work could be
undertaken. The defendants sought to rely on an exclusion clause contained in an
invoice which stated that ‘[t]he Company is not responsible for damage caused by fire to
customers’ cars on the premises’. The plaintiff had signed this invoice on at least two
previous occasions when the defendants repaired his car but he was not asked to sign it
on this occasion. The plaintiff had had his car repaired by the defendants on three or
four occasions over a five-year period. The defendants submitted that the exclusion
clause contained in the invoice had been incorporated into the contract as a result of the
course of dealing between the parties. The Court of Appeal rejected this submission. It
was held that ‘not quite one dealing a year’ was insufficient to constitute a course of
dealing. A greater degree of regularity is required (see, for example, 
Henry Kendall &
Sons (A Firm)
 
v. 
William Lillico & Sons Ltd
 
[1969] 2 AC 31, where there were three or
four transactions between the parties per month over a three-year period).
The position may, however, be different where the parties to the transaction are in
the same trade or industry. In such a case the court may be able to incorporate the term
into the contract either on the basis of a course of dealing between the parties or on the
basis of the ‘common understanding’ of the parties derived from the practice of the
trade. This point is demonstrated by the following case:
BRITISH CRANE HIRE CORPORATION V. IPSWICH
PLANT HIRE LTD
[1975] QB 303, Court of Appeal
The defendants being in urgent need of a dragline crane agreed to hire one from
the plaintiffs. Both parties were in the business of hiring out heavy earth-moving
equipment. Given the urgency of the situation, the agreement was reached over
the telephone. Agreement was reached on the price but nothing was said about
the general conditions of hire. The plaintiffs did send their conditions of hire to the
defendants but before the defendants signed it the crane sank into the marshy
ground on which the defendants were working (although the accident occurred
without negligence on the part of the defendants). The plaintiffs sought to recover
from the defendants the cost of recovering the crane from the marshy ground. The
defendants denied that they were liable to meet this cost. The Court of Appeal held
that the defendants were liable to meet this cost on the basis that the plaintiffs’
terms contained a clause which required the defendants to indemnify them against
such losses and such a term was, as the defendants knew, in standard use in the
trade.
Lord Denning MR
In support of the course of dealing, the plaintiffs relied on two previous transactions
in which the defendants had hired cranes from the plaintiffs. One was February 20,
1969; and the other October 6, 1969. Each was on a printed form which set out the
hiring of a crane, the price, the site, and so forth; and also setting out the
conditions the same as those here. There were thus only two transactions many
months before and they were not known to the defendants’ manager who ordered
this crane. In the circumstances I doubt whether those two would be sufficient to
show a course of dealing.
In 
Hollier
 
v. 
Rambler Motors (AMC) Ltd
 
[1972] 2 QB 71, 76 Salmon LJ said he
knew of no case
‘in which it has been decided or even argued that a term could be implied into an oral contract on the
strength of a course of dealing (if it can be so called) which consisted at the most of three or four
transactions over a period of five years.’
That was a case of a private individual who had had his car repaired by the
defendants and had signed forms with conditions on three or four occasions. The
plaintiff there was not of equal bargaining power with the garage company which
repaired the car. The conditions were not incorporated.
But here the parties were both in the trade and were of equal bargaining power.
Each was a firm of plant hirers who hired out plant. The defendants themselves
knew that firms in the plant-hiring trade always imposed conditions in regard to the
hiring of plant: and that their conditions were on much the same lines …
[He considered the evidence and continued]
From that evidence it is clear that both parties knew quite well that conditions
were habitually imposed by the supplier of these machines: and both parties knew
the substance of 
those conditions. In particular that if the crane sank in soft ground
it was the hirer’s job to recover it: and that there was an indemnity clause. In these
circumstances, I think the conditions on the form should be regarded as
incorporated into the contract. I would not put it so much on the course of dealing,
but rather on the common understanding which is to be derived from the conduct
of the parties, namely, that the hiring was to be on the terms of the plaintiffs’ usual
conditions.
As Lord Reid said in 
McCutcheon
 
v. 
David MacBrayne Ltd
 
[1964] 1 WLR 125,
128 quoting from the Scottish textbook, Gloag on Contract, 2nd edn (1929), p. 7:
‘The judicial task is not to discover the actual intentions of each party; it is to decide what each was
reasonably entitled to conclude from the attitude of the other.’
It seems to me that, in view of the relationship of the parties, when the defendants
requested this crane urgently and it was supplied at once—before the usual form
was received—the plaintiffs were entitled to conclude that the defendants were
accepting it on the terms of the plaintiffs’ own printed conditions—which would
follow in a day or two. It is just as if the plaintiffs had said: ‘We will supply it on our
usual conditions’, and the defendants said ‘Of course, that is quite understood’.
Applying the conditions, it is quite clear that nos. 6 and 8 cover the second
mishap. The defendants are liable for the cost of recovering the crane from the soft
ground.

Implied Terms
Central Issues
Terms may be implied into contracts from three principal sources,
namely statute, custom, and the courts.
Terms are frequently implied into contracts by Parliament. These
terms can be very important in practice. For example, terms are
implied into contracts for the sale of goods which give buyers
important rights against sellers. These terms were first enacted in the
Sale of Goods Act 1893 and are now to be found in the Sale of Goods
Act 1979 (and for consumers in the Consumer Rights Act 2015).
Terms can also be implied into contracts by custom where the custom
is certain, reasonable, and notorious. Customs and usages are an
important source of obligations in commercial contracts.
Courts also imply terms into contracts. The jurisdiction of the court to
imply terms into a contract is a source of considerable controversy.
The difficulty which the courts have experienced lies in locating both
the basis and the extent of their jurisdiction to imply terms into a
contract. The traditional justification for the implication of terms is that
the court is giving effect to the presumed intention of the parties.
Terms were therefore implied on the basis that it was necessary to do
so. However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to justify the implication
of all terms on the basis of necessity. In some cases the courts take
account of a wider range of considerations than the presumed
intention of the parties and apply a test that is less stringent than
necessity. On the other hand, the courts have rejected the proposition
that they can imply a term into a contract simply on the basis that it is
reasonable to do so.
Implied terms are customarily divided into two categories, namely
terms implied in law and terms implied in fact. In the case of terms
implied in fact it is possible to ascribe the implied term to the intention
of the parties, but it is much more difficult to do this where the term is
implied in law. In the latter case a term is implied as an incident of
every contract of that kind and the courts take account of a wide range
of considerations when deciding whether or not to imply such a term
into the contract.
10.1
 
Introduction
Implied terms are important both in practice and in theory. They are important in
practice because a number of important terms in contracts today are there as a result of
implication rather than express agreement. The implied terms contained in sections 12–
15 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and in sections 9–18 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015
impose important obligations upon sellers of goods. The word ‘impose’ is important.
These terms can no longer be attributed to the intention of the parties because
Parliament has intervened to establish very strict limits within which these terms can be
excluded (in the case of consumer contracts they cannot be excluded at all). One of the
important terms to be found in contracts of employment is a term to the effect that the
parties must not conduct themselves in such a way as to undermine the relationship of
‘trust and confidence’ that exists between an employer and an employee. Again, this
implied term does not owe its origin to the express agreement of the parties. Its source is
to be found in the willingness of the courts to imply such a term into contracts of
employment (
Mahmud
 
v. 
Bank of Credit and Commercial International SA
 
[1998] AC
20, see further 
10.4.2
).
Two issues of particular significance arise in relation to implied terms. The first relates
to the justification for implying terms into contracts. On what basis do the courts and
Parliament imply terms into a contract? Is it to give effect to the presumed intention of
the parties or is the search for an implied term based on wider considerations of policy?
The second issue relates to the test to be applied by the courts when deciding whether or
not to imply a term into a contract. This issue is related to the first one. If the
justification for implying a term into a contract is to give effect to the presumed
intention of the parties, then it can be said that the test is based on necessity. A term will
only be implied where it is necessary to give effect to the presumed intention of the
parties. On the other hand, if the justification for implying a term is to be located in
broader issues of policy, then one would expect the test applied by the court to reflect
these broader policy issues: in short, one would expect a test based upon criteria such as
the reasonableness of the implication on the facts of the case.

Terms Implied by Statute
Parliament has, on a number of occasions, implied terms into contracts. The precise
reason for the implication of the term obviously depends upon the particular statute. It
may be to give effect to the presumed intention of the parties; it may be to reduce
uncertainty by enacting a default rule out of which the parties can contract if they do not
like the term that Parliament has seen fit to imply; or it may be to protect one party to
the transaction from the superior bargaining power of the other party. Terms have been
implied by Parliament into a wide range of transactions: for example, contracts for the
sale of goods, hire-purchase contracts, other contracts for the supply of goods, contracts
for the supply of services, and contracts for the construction of a dwelling. We shall use
contracts for the sale of goods as our example. Sections 12–15 of the Sale of Goods Act
1979 imply a number of terms into contracts for the sale of goods. These terms are as
follows:
Implied terms about title, etc.
(1) In a contract of sale, other than one to which subsection (3) below applies, there is an implied term
on the part of the seller that in the case of a sale he has a right to sell the goods, and in the case of an
agreement to sell he will have such a right at the time when the property is to pass.
In a contract of sale, other than one to which subsection (3) below applies, there is also an implied term
that—
the goods are free, and will remain free until the time when the property is to pass, from any
charge or encumbrance not disclosed or known to the buyer before the contract is made, and
the buyer will enjoy quiet possession of the goods except so far as it may be disturbed by the
owner or other person entitled to the benefit of any charge or encumbrance so disclosed or
known.
This subsection applies to a contract of sale in the case of which there appears from the contract or is to
be inferred from its circumstances an intention that the seller should transfer only such title as he or a
third person may have.
In a contract to which subsection (3) above applies there is an implied term that all charges or
encumbrances known to the seller and not known to the buyer have been disclosed to the buyer before
the contract is made.
In a contract to which subsection (3) above applies there is also an implied term that none of the
following will disturb the buyer’s quiet possession of the goods, namely—
(a)
(b)
(c)
(5A)
(7)

the seller;
in a case where the parties to the contract intend that the seller should transfer only such title as
a third person may have, that person;
anyone claiming through or under the seller or that third person otherwise than under a charge
or encumbrance disclosed or known to the buyer before the contract is made.
As regards England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the term implied by subsection (1) above is a
condition and the terms implied by subsections (2), (4) and (5) above are warranties. …
This section does not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015
applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in section 17 of that Act).
Sale by description
(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied term that the goods
will correspond with the description.
As regards England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the term implied by subsection (1) above is a
condition.
If the sale is by sample as well as by description it is not sufficient that the bulk of the goods corresponds
with the sample if the goods do not also correspond with the description.
A sale of goods is not prevented from being a sale by description by reason only that, being exposed for
sale or hire, they are selected by the buyer. …
This section does not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015
applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in section 11 of that Act).
Implied terms about quality or fitness
(1) Except as provided by this section and section 15 below and subject to any other enactment, there is
no implied term about the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a
contract of sale.
Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there is an implied term that the goods supplied
under the contract are of satisfactory quality.
For the purposes of this Act, goods are of satisfactory quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable
person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant)
and all the other relevant circumstances.
For the purposes of this Act, the quality of goods includes their state and condition and the following
(among others) are in appropriate cases aspects of the quality of goods—
fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied,
appearance and finish,
freedom from minor defects,
safety, and
durability.
The term implied by subsection (2) above does not extend to any matter making the quality of goods
unsatisfactory—
which is specifically drawn to the buyer’s attention before the contract is made,

where the buyer examines the goods before the contract is made, which that examination ought
to reveal, or
in the case of a contract for sale by sample, which would have been apparent on a reasonable
examination of the sample.
…
Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business and the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes
known—
to the seller, or
where the purchase price or part of it is payable by instalments and the goods were previously
sold by a credit-broker to the seller, to that credit-broker, any particular purpose for which the
goods are being bought, there is an implied term that the goods supplied under the contract are
reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which such goods are
commonly supplied, except where the circumstances show that the buyer does not rely, or that it
is unreasonable for him to rely, on the skill or judgment of the seller or credit-broker.
An implied term about quality or fitness for a particular purpose may be annexed to a contract of sale by
usage.
The preceding provisions of this section apply to a sale by a person who in the course of a business is
acting as agent for another as they apply to a sale by a principal in the course of a business, except where
that other is not selling in the course of a business and either the buyer knows that fact or reasonable
steps are taken to bring it to the notice of the buyer before the contract is made.
As regards England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the terms implied by subsections (2) and (3) above
are conditions. …
This section does not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015
applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in sections 9, 10 and 18 of that Act).
Sale by sample
Sale by sample
(1) A contract of sale is a contract for sale by sample where there is an express or implied term to that
effect in the contract.
In the case of a contract for sale by sample there is an implied term—
that the bulk will correspond with the sample in quality; …
that the goods will be free from any defect, making their quality unsatisfactory, which would not
be apparent on reasonable examination of the sample.
As regards England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the term implied by subsection (2) above is a
condition. …
This section does not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015
applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in sections 13 and 18 of that Act).
Commentary
These implied terms are of considerable significance for buyers of goods because they
give them a number of important rights against sellers of goods. The rule at common law
was generally believed to be ‘
caveat emptor
’ (let the buyer beware). Under such a rule
the onus was put upon the buyer to seek a specific undertaking from the seller in
relation to the quality of the goods. Now that the implied terms have been enacted, the
need for buyers to seek express undertakings from sellers has been significantly
reduced. The implied terms contained in sections 12–15 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979
provide buyers with a minimum floor of rights and, as we shall see, the law has placed
considerable limits on the ability of sellers to contract out of these implied terms. It
should be noted that these implied terms no longer apply to contracts of sale concluded
between a trader and a consumer. This is because such contracts now fall within the
scope of Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which makes provision for the
incorporation of broadly similar but slightly differently worded terms into such
contracts. In the account that follows we shall focus attention on contracts which fall
within the scope of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and will not enter into the details of
sections 9–18 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015.
The aim of section 12 is to give a buyer a remedy against a seller in the event that the
seller does not have title to sell the goods that he has contracted to sell to the buyer. In
such a case the buyer will generally be entitled to recover from the seller the price which
he has paid for the goods. This is so even in the case where the buyer has been able to
make use of the goods over a period of time prior to discovery of the fact that the seller
did not have title to the goods that have been sold to the buyer (see, for example,
Rowland
 
v. 
Divall
 
[1923] 2 KB 500). Section 12(2) also implies two warranties into
contracts for the sale of goods. The function of 
the warranties of freedom from
encumbrances and quiet possession is, essentially, to enable the buyer to enjoy the use
of the goods without interference by third parties. The implied term as to title is a
condition, whereas the implied terms relating to freedom from encumbrances and quiet
possession are warranties. The difference between a condition and a warranty will be
explained in more detail in a later chapter (see 
22.3.1
). Here it suffices to note that
breach of a condition entitles a buyer to reject the goods and terminate the contract,
whereas breach of a warranty does not. The only remedy for breach of a warranty is
damages.
Section 13 provides protection for the buyer who receives goods that do not correspond
with the description. The section is, however, more difficult than it looks at first sight
and it has generated a considerable amount of case-law. The section only comes into
play where there has been a contract for sale ‘by’ description. In order for the contract to
be by description the buyer must have entered into the contract in reliance upon the
description provided by the seller (
Harlingdon and Leinster Enterprises Ltd
 
v.
Christopher Hull Fine Art Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 564). In order to amount to a ‘description’ the
words used must identify the subject matter of the contract (
Reardon Smith Line Ltd
 
v.
Yngvar Hansen-Tangen
 
[1976] 1 WLR 989).
Section 14 implies two very important conditions into contracts for the sale of goods.
The first, contained in section 14(2), (2A), and (2B), is that the goods must be of
‘satisfactory quality’ (formerly ‘merchantable quality’). It provides a checklist of factors
to be taken into account when deciding whether or not goods are of satisfactory quality.
The second condition, to be found in section 14(3), is that the goods must be reasonably
fit for their purpose. A buyer who wishes to make some unusual use of the goods must
disclose that use to the seller prior to entry into the contract of sale if he wishes to be
able to invoke the fitness for purpose implied term. The seller does not provide a
guarantee that the goods will be fit for all purposes. The goods need only be ‘reasonably
fit’ for their purpose. So, where the goods cannot be used for their intended purpose
because of some idiosyncrasy, not made known to the seller, of the buyer or in the
circumstances of the use of the goods by the buyer, the seller will not be liable to the
buyer under section 14(3) (
Slater
 
v. 
Finning Ltd
 
[1997] AC 473). These two conditions
only come into play where the ‘seller sells goods in the course of a business’. The test
applied by the court when deciding whether or not the seller sold in the course of a
business does not depend upon the regularity of the sale or whether it was integral to the
seller’s business. In 
Stevenson
 
v. 
Rogers
 
[1999] QB 1028 the Court of Appeal held that,
unless the sale was ‘a purely private sale of goods outside the confines of the business (if
any) carried on by the seller’ it is within the course of the seller’s business so as to attract
the implied terms relating to satisfactory quality and fitness for purpose.
Section 15 implies two conditions in the case of a sale of goods by sample. The first is
that the bulk will correspond with the sample in quality and the second is that the goods
will be free from any defect making their quality unsatisfactory, which would not be
apparent on reasonable examination of the sample (see 
Godley
 
v. 
Perry
 
[1960] 1 WLR
9).
The importance of these implied terms is demonstrated by the fact that Parliament has
intervened to place restrictions upon the ability of sellers to exclude their operation. In
the case of contracts of sale concluded between a trader and a consumer, the terms
implied by ss 9–18 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 cannot be excluded as against the
consumer (see s 31 of the 2015 Act). In commercial sales the implied terms in the Sale of
Goods Act can be excluded provided that it is reasonable to do so (except in the case of
section 12 where it is not possible to exclude liability for breach of this term). Statutory
controls on exclusion and limitation of liability are discussed in more detail later (see
13.3
).
What is the basis of these implied terms? Are they based on the presumed intention of
the parties? There is some support for this proposition in the authorities. In 
Philips
Electronique 
Grand Publique SA
 
v. 
British Sky Broadcasting Ltd
 
[1995] EMLR 472
Lord Bingham MR stated (at p. 481) that:
quite apart from statute, the courts would not ordinarily hesitate to imply into a contract for the sale of unseen
goods that they should be of merchantable quality and answer to their description and conform with sample. It
is hard to imagine trade conducted, in the absence of express agreement, on any other terms.
While it may be ‘hard to imagine’ trade being conducted on any other terms, it is not
impossible. There is still in English law no general implied term that a house is fit for
any particular purpose or even for human habitation. Further, as a general rule a
landlord does not give an implied undertaking that leased premises will be fit for
habitation or for any particular purpose, although in the case of a lease of furnished
premises there is an implied condition that the premises are fit for human habitation at
the beginning of the tenancy. If contracts for the sale of real property can be concluded
without the benefit of extensive implied terms for the benefit of the purchaser, can the
same not be said of contracts for the sale of personal property, such as goods? Support
for the proposition that contracts for the sale of goods can be concluded without the
benefit of such implied terms can be derived from the law of sale in the nineteenth
century, where 
caveat emptor
 
played a much more dominant role than it does today.
This being the case, the claim that the implied terms are based on the presumed
intention of the parties seems very doubtful. It is much more likely that the function of
the implied terms is to protect what are perceived to be the legitimate or reasonable
expectations of buyers when they enter into contracts for the sale of goods. That this is
so is evidenced by the fact that Parliament has intervened to limit the ability of sellers to
contract out of these terms. The fact that it is impossible to contract out of some of these
implied terms demonstrates that they are not based on the presumed intention of the
parties. They are part of a legislative policy to protect the expectations of buyers,
especially consumer buyers.
10.3
 
Terms Implied from Usage or Custom
Terms may be implied into a contract from the usage or custom of the industry or
market in which the parties transact. In 
Hutton
 
v. 
Warren
 
(1836) 1 M & W 466 Parke B
stated (at p. 475) that:
[i]t has long been settled, that, in commercial transactions, extrinsic evidence of custom and usage is admissible
to annex incidents to written contracts, in matters with respect to which they are silent. The same rule has also
been applied to contracts in other transactions of life, in which known usages have been established and
prevailed; and this has been done upon the principle of presumption that, in such transactions, the parties did
not mean to express in writing the whole of the contract by which they intended to be bound, but a contract with
reference to those known usages. Whether such a relaxation of the strictness of the common law was wisely
applied, where formal instruments have been entered into, and particularly leases under seal, may well be
doubted; but the contrary has been established by such authority, and the relations between landlord and
tenant have been so long regulated upon the supposition that all customary obligations, not altered by the
contract, are to remain in force, that it is too late to pursue a contrary course; and it would be productive of
much inconvenience if this practice were now to be disturbed.
Two points emerge from this statement. The first is that the usage must be a ‘known’
usage. This does not mean that the parties must actually have been aware of its
existence. It suffices that it was so well known that ‘an outsider who makes reasonable
enquiries could not fail to be made aware of it’ (
Kum
 
v. 
Wah Tat Bank Ltd
 
[1971] 1
Lloyd’s Rep 439, 444). The requirement that the custom be ‘known’ is often expressed in
the formula that the custom or usage must be ‘notorious, certain and reasonable’. In
Cunliffe-Owen
 
v. 
Teather & Greenwood
 
[1967] 1 WLR 1421 Ungoed-Thomas J stated (at
pp. 1438–1439) that:
[f]or the practice to amount to such a recognised usage, it must be certain, in the sense that the practice is
clearly established; it must be notorious, in the sense that it is so well known in the market in which it is alleged
to exist that those who conduct business in that market contract with the usage as an implied term, and it must
be reasonable. The burden lies on those alleging usage to establish it. … The practice that has to be established
consists of a continuity of acts, and those acts have to be established by persons familiar with them, although, as
is accepted before me, they may be sufficiently established by such persons without a detailed recital of
instances. Practice is not a matter of opinion of even the most highly qualified expert as to what it is desirable
that the practice should be. However, evidence of those versed in a market, so it seems to me, may be admissible
and valuable in identifying those features of any transaction that attract usage and in discounting other features
which for such purpose are merely incidental and if there is conflict of evidence about this it is subject to being
resolved like other conflicts of evidence. Arrangements or compromises to the same effect as the alleged usage
do not establish usage; they contradict it. They may be the precursors of usage, but usage presupposes that
arrangements and compromises are no longer required. It is, in my view, clearly not necessary that a practice
should be challenged and enforced before it can become a usage as, otherwise, a practice so obviously
universally accepted and acted on as not to be challenged could never be a usage. However, enforcement would
be valuable and might be conclusive in establishing usage. What is necessary is that for a practice to be a
recognised usage it should be established as a practice having binding effect.
The last sentence is important because it demonstrates that repetitive behaviour in the
market is not sufficient, of itself, to establish a custom: ‘it must also be shown that this
pattern of behaviour is observed from a sense of legally binding obligation, not from
mere courtesy, convenience or expediency’ (R Goode, ‘Usage and its Reception in
Transnational Commercial Law’ (1997) 46 
ICLQ
 
1, 8). In 
General Reinsurance Corp
 
v.
Försäkringsaktiebolaget Fennia Patria
 
[1983] QB 856, 874 Slade LJ stated:
There is, however, the world of difference between a course of conduct that is frequently, or even habitually,
followed in a particular commercial community as a matter of grace and a course which is habitually followed
because it is considered that the parties concerned have a legally binding right to demand it.
The distinction between courtesy and obligation, while easy to state in theory, can be
difficult to draw in practice (see, for example, 
Libyan Arab Foreign Bank
 
v. 
Bankers
Trust Co
 
[1989] QB 728). It is nevertheless a distinction of considerable importance.
The second point that can be derived from the judgment of Parke B in 
Warren
 
is that
the custom must not have been ‘altered by the contract’. A term will therefore not be
implied into a contract by custom where the custom is inconsistent with the express
terms of the contract (
Palgrave, Brown & Son Ltd
 
v. 
SS Turid (Owners)
 
[1922] 1 AC
397).
Custom and usage play an important role in commercial law generally as the following
extract demonstrates.
EWAN MCKENDRICK, 
GOODE AND MCKENDRICK ON
COMMERCIAL LAW
(6th edn, Penguin, 2020), paras 1.21–1.24
Of great importance as a source of obligation in commercial contracts are the
unwritten customs and usages of merchants. The impact of these on the content
and interpretation of contract terms cannot be overstated. It is, perhaps, this
feature above all which distinguishes commercial from other contracts, a distinction
not formally adopted by the law. The fertility of the business mind and the fact that
a practice which begins life by having no legal force acquires over time the sanctity
of law are key factors to which the commercial lawyer must continually be
responsive. Is a particular document a document of title? The House of Lords or
other appellate court may have said no, possibly more than once. But how long
ago was the ruling given? Cannot it now be said, in another time, that the
acceptance of this document as a document of title in mercantile usage is so
entrenched as to justify according it legal recognition as such? …
What is it that gives binding force to unwritten mercantile usage? Is it the
express or implied adoption of the usage by the parties in their contract? Or does
mercantile usage have independent normative force? The question has been much
debated in the context of international commercial arbitration and the controversy
as to the existence of an international 
lex mercatoria
. In some legal systems the
binding force of mercantile usage does not depend on adoption by contract, but in
the theory of English law usage takes effect as an express or implied term of the
contract between the parties and is dependent for its validity on satisfying certain
legal criteria, namely certainty and consistency of practice, reasonableness,
notoriety, and conformity with mandatory law. Moreover, in order to constitute a
usage the practice must be observed from a sense of legally binding obligation, not
as a matter of mere courtesy or convenience or a desire to accommodate a
customer’s wishes.
It is in the nature of unwritten custom or usage that its meaning and content
may be understood differently by different people; indeed, the very existence of an
alleged usage may be challenged. In areas of business or finance with a highly
developed and widely used body of custom or usage it is particularly important to
avoid disputes of this kind. To that end, national and international trade
associations and clearing houses may find it convenient to formulate the relevant
usages in a published code or set of rules. These will rarely reflect existing usage
in every particular, since the opportunity will usually be taken to make
improvements to established practice and procedures, but the intended effect of
the code or rules is to state or restate best practice. They may be given effect
either by making adherence to them a condition of membership of the relevant
association or clearing house or by incorporation into individual contracts. At the
international level the prime mover in the codification of international trade usage is
the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), an international nongovernmental
organization serving world business. Working through its specialist Commissions,
the ICC has produced numerous uniform rules which are adopted by incorporation
into contracts. These fall broadly into three groups: banking and insurance,
international trade and international transport. The most long-standing and
successful of the various ICC formulations is the Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits (UCP), first promulgated by the ICC in 1933. Bankers
throughout the world have adopted the UCP, which is now used almost universally
in documentary credit transactions.
 
…
In English law codified customs and usages, like those which are uncodified,
depend for their operation on express or implied adoption in the contract.
As the last sentence of the extract makes clear, customs, at least in English law, depend
for their operation on ‘express or implied’ incorporation into the contract. Very often
that incorporation will be express (and so might properly be said to fall within the scope
of 
Chapter 9
). Thus banks will generally incorporate the UCP expressly into their
contracts with their customers. The reason for this is that the matter is too important to
be left to implication by a court. However, should a bank fail, for some reason, to
incorporate the UCP into a contract with one of its customers, it is likely that a court
would conclude that it was incorporated into the contract either on the basis of custom
or on the basis of a course of dealing between the parties (on which see 
9.4
).
 
Letters of credit are discussed in more detail at 
5.4
, where their essential nature is described.

Terms Implied by the Courts
It is customary to divide terms implied by the courts into two groups, namely terms
implied in fact and terms implied in law. A term is implied in fact when it is implied into
the contract in order to give effect to what is deemed by the court to be the unexpressed
intention of the parties. It is generally, but not always, a term that is specific to the
particular transaction between the parties. Terms implied in law ‘are those terms that
are consistently implied into all contracts of a particular type because of the nature of
the contract, rather than the supposed intentions of the parties’ (E Peden, ‘Policy
Concerns Behind Implication of Terms in Law’ (2001) 117 
LQR
 
459). For example, the
courts have held that there is an implied term of ‘trust and confidence’ in contracts of
employment (see 
10.4.2
). The existence of this term is not dependent upon it being
representative of the unexpressed intention of the parties to the particular employment
contract. It is a term that is implied into all contracts of employment unless it has been
expressly excluded by the parties.
The importance of the distinction between a term implied in fact and a term implied in
law is that the test for the implication of a term as a matter of law appears to be less
stringent than that applicable to terms implied in fact. Traditionally, the courts have
insisted that they will only imply a term into a contract as a matter of fact where it is
‘necessary’ to do so. In the case of terms implied in law, however, it would appear that
the test is not one of necessity, although the precise nature of the test remains unclear. It
appears to be somewhere in between ‘reasonableness’ and ‘necessity’. Thus it might be
said that it must be ‘reasonably necessary’ to imply the term into the contract.
While the distinction between terms implied in fact and terms implied in law is not
always an easy one to draw, the cases do seem to draw this distinction and so we shall
make use of it in this chapter (while bearing in mind the difficulty that can arise in terms
of drawing the distinction). We shall start with terms implied in fact before moving on to
the more difficult issue of terms implied in law.
10.4.1
 
Terms Implied in Fact
We shall start with the first leading case on the implication of terms into a contract,
namely the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
The Moorcock
 
(1889) 14 PD 64. It
articulated a test based on ‘necessity’ rather than ‘reasonableness’. We shall then make
the leap to the leading modern decision on terms implied in fact, namely the decision of
the Supreme Court in 
Marks and Spencer plc
 
v. 
BNP Paribas Securities Services Trust
Co (Jersey) Ltd
 
[2015] UKSC 72, [2016] AC 742.
THE MOORCOCK
(1889) 14 PD 64, Court of Appeal
The defendants agreed to allow the plaintiff to discharge his vessel at their wharf
so that the vessel could discharge and load her cargo. In order for the vessel to be
able to discharge her cargo it was necessary for the vessel to be moored
alongside the jetty (which was also owned by the defendants). The jetty extended
into the River Thames and the bed of the river adjoining the jetty was vested in the
Conservators of the River Thames. While the vessel was moored at the end of the
jetty, the tide ebbed so that the vessel was no longer waterborne and she suffered
damage as a result of the uneven condition of the river bed. The plaintiff brought
an action for damages against the defendants. The defendants admitted that they
had not taken any steps to ascertain whether or not the ground was level and
suitable for the vessel. The trial judge, Butt J, held that the defendants were liable
in damages to the plaintiff on the ground that they were in breach of an implied
undertaking to take ‘reasonable care to ascertain that the bottom of the river at the
jetty was in such a condition as not to endanger the vessel using their premises in
the ordinary way’. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal but the appeal
was dismissed.
Bowen LJ
The question which arises here is whether when a contract is made to let the use
of this jetty to a ship which can only use it, as is known by both parties, by taking
the ground, there is any implied warranty on the part of the owners of the jetty, and
if so, what is the extent of the warranty. Now, an implied warranty, or, as it is called,
a covenant in law, as distinguished from an express contract or express warranty,
really is in all cases founded on the presumed intention of the parties, and upon
reason. The implication which the law draws from what must obviously have been
the intention of the parties, the law draws with the object of giving efficacy to the
transaction and preventing such a failure of consideration as cannot have been
within the contemplation of either side; and I believe if one were to take all the
cases, and they are many, of implied warranties or covenants in law, it will be
found that in all of them the law is raising an implication from the presumed
intention of the parties with the object of giving to the transaction such efficacy as
both parties must have intended that at all events it should have. In business
transactions such as this, what the law desires to effect by the implication is to give
such business efficacy to the transaction as must have been intended at all events
by both parties who are business men; not to impose on one side all the perils of
the transaction, or to emancipate one side from all the chances of failure, but to
make each party promise in law as much, at all events, as it must have been in the
contemplation of both parties that he should be responsible for in respect of those
perils or chances.
Now what did each party in a case like this know? For if we are examining into
their presumed intention we must examine into their minds as to what the
transaction was. Both parties knew that this jetty was let out for hire, and knew that
it could only be used under the contract by the ship taking the ground. They must
have known that it was by grounding that she used the jetty; in fact, except so far
as the transport to the jetty of the cargo in the ship was concerned, they must have
known, both of them, that unless the ground was safe the ship would be simply
buying an opportunity of danger, and that all consideration would fail unless some
care had been taken to see that the ground was safe. In fact the business of the
jetty could not be carried on except upon such a basis. The parties also knew that
with regard to the safety of the ground outside the jetty the shipowner could know
nothing at all, and the jetty owner might with reasonable care know everything. The
owners of the jetty, or 
their servants, were there at high and low tide, and with little
trouble they could satisfy themselves, in case of doubt, as to whether the berth
was reasonably safe. The ship’s owner, on the other hand, had not the means of
verifying the state of the jetty, because the berth itself opposite the jetty might be
occupied by another ship at any moment.
Now the question is how much of the peril of the safety of this berth is it
necessary to assume that the shipowner and the jetty owner intended respectively
to bear—in order that such a minimum of efficacy should be secured for the
transaction, as both parties must have intended it to bear? Assume that the berth
outside had been absolutely under the control of the owners of the jetty, that they
could have repaired it and made it fit for the purpose of the unloading and the
loading. If this had been the case, then the case of 
The Mersey Docks Trustees
 
v.
Gibbs
 
Law Rep 1 HL 93 shews that those who owned the jetty, who took money for
the use of the jetty, and who had under their control the locus in quo, would have
been bound to take all reasonable care to prevent danger to those who were using
the jetty—either to make the berth outside good, or else not to invite ships to go
there—either to make the berth safe, or to advise persons not to go there. But
there is a distinction in the present instance. The berth outside the jetty was not
under the actual control of the jetty owners. It is in the bed of the river, and it may
be said that those who owned the jetty had no duty cast upon them by statute or
common law to repair the bed of the river, and that they had no power to interfere
with the bed of the river unless under the licence of the Conservators. Now it does
make a difference, it seems to me, where the entire control of the locus in quo—be
it canal, or be it dock, or be it river berth—is not under the control of the persons
who are taking toll for accommodation which involves its user, and, to a certain
extent, the view must be modified of the necessary implication which the law would
make about the duties of the parties receiving the remuneration. This must be
done exactly for the reason laid down by Lord Holt in his judgment in 
Coggs
 
v.
Bernard
 
Ld Raym 909, where he says ‘it would be unreasonable to charge persons
with a trust further than the nature of the thing puts it in their power to perform’.
Applying that modification, which is one of reason, to this case, it may well be said
that the law will not imply that the persons who have not the control of the place
have taken reasonable care to make it good, but it does not follow that they are
relieved from all responsibility. They are on the spot. They must know that the jetty
cannot be used unless reasonable care is taken, if not to make it safe, at all events
to see whether it is safe. No one can tell whether reasonable safety has been
secured except themselves, and I think if they let out their jetty for use they at all
events imply that they have taken reasonable care to see whether the berth, which
is the essential part of the use of the jetty, is safe, and if it is not safe, and if they
have not taken such reasonable care, it is their duty to warn persons with whom
they have dealings that they have not done so. This is a business transaction as to
which at any moment the parties may make any bargain they please, and either
side may by the contract throw upon the other the burden of the unseen and
existing danger. The question is what inference is to be drawn where the parties
are dealing with each other on the assumption that the negotiations are to have
some fruit, and where they say nothing about the burden of this kind of unseen
peril, leaving the law to raise such inferences as are reasonable from the very
nature of the transaction. So far as I am concerned I do not wish it to be
understood that I at all consider this is a case of any duty on the part of the owners
of the jetty to see to the access to the jetty being kept clear. The difference
between access to the jetty and the actual use of the jetty seems to me, as Mr
Finlay [counsel for the defendants] says it is, only a question of degree, but when
you are dealing with implications which the law directs, you cannot afford to
neglect questions of degree, and it is just that difference of degree which brings
one case on the line and prevents the other from approaching it. I confess that on
the broad view of the case I think that business could not be carried on unless
there was an implication to the extent I have laid down, at all events in the case
where a jetty like the present is so to be used, and, although the case is a novel
one, and the cases which have been cited do not assist us, I feel no difficulty in
drawing the inference that this case comes within the line.

Commentary
The Moorcock
 
is an important case for two reasons. The first relates to the source of the
implied term. Bowen LJ attributed it to the ‘presumed intention of the parties’. In this
way he avoided the conclusion that the court was making the contract for the parties.
Instead, the court stated that it was giving effect to the intention of the parties, albeit
that the intention was presumed rather than express. However, it should be noted that
Bowen LJ does not rest the implication of terms solely upon the ‘presumed intention of
the parties’. He adds that it is also based ‘upon reason’. This appears to suggest a wider
basis for the implication of terms, a point to which we shall return. The second point
relates to the test put forward by Bowen LJ. It is one based on the need to give ‘business
efficacy’ to the transaction. This has been interpreted subsequently as a test that is based
on necessity rather than reasonableness. In other words, the court does not imply a term
into the contract on the basis that it is, in the opinion of the court, reasonable to do so.
The court implies a term into the contract on the basis that it is necessary to do so in
order to make the contract work. That said, was the term implied in 
The Moorcock
 
one
that was necessary to give efficacy to the contract? Could the contract not have worked
without such a term? The issue before the court was, in essence, who was to take the risk
of the bed of the river being unsuitable for the vessel. Business efficacy does not seem to
require that the risk be allocated to one party or the other. Nevertheless, the court took
the view that business efficacy supported the implication of a term to the effect that the
defendants had undertaken to exercise reasonable care to ascertain that the river bed
adjoining the jetty was in such a condition as not to cause injury to the vessel.
In the years following 
The Moorcock
 
the necessity test established itself in the case-law.
Two famous judicial statements demonstrate this. The first is taken from the judgment
of Scrutton LJ in 
Reigate
 
v. 
Union Manufacturing Co (Ramsbottom) Ltd
 
[1918] 1 KB
592 when he stated (at p. 605):
A term can only be implied if it is necessary in the business sense to give efficacy to the contract; that is, if it is
such a term that it can confidently be said that if at the time the contract was being negotiated some one had
said to the parties, ‘What will happen in such a case’, they would both have replied, ‘Of course, so and so will
happen; we did not trouble to say that; it is too clear’. Unless the Court comes to some such conclusion as that,
it ought not to imply a term which the parties themselves have not expressed.
The second example is a passage from the judgment of MacKinnon LJ in 
Shirlaw
 
v.
Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd
 
[1939] 2 KB 206 when he said (at p. 227):
I recognize that the right or duty of a Court to find the existence of an implied term or implied terms in a written
contract is a matter to be exercised with care; and a Court is too often 
invited to do so upon vague and uncertain
grounds. Too often also such an invitation is backed by the citation of a sentence or two from the judgment of
Bowen LJ in 
The Moorcock
 
(1889) 14 PD 64. They are sentences from an extempore judgment as sound and
sensible as all the utterances of that great judge; but I fancy that he would have been rather surprised if he could
have foreseen that these general remarks of his would come to be a favourite citation of a supposed principle of
law, and I even think that he might sympathize with the occasional impatience of his successors when 
The
Moorcock
 
is so often flushed for them in that guise.
For my part, I think that there is a test that may be at least as useful as such generalities. If I may quote from
an essay which I wrote some years ago, I then said: ‘Prima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied
and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying; so that, if, while the parties were
making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in their agreement,
they would testily suppress him with a common “Oh, of course!”’
This test has become known as the ‘officious bystander’ test and it emphasizes the fact
that the test to be applied by the court is one of necessity, not reasonableness. The
significance of these various formulations and the subsequent development of the law
were considered by Lord Neuberger in the following case, which is now the leading
modern decision on the test to be applied when deciding whether or not to imply a term
into a contract as a matter of fact.
MARKS AND SPENCER PLC V. BNP PARIBAS
SECURITIES SERVICES TRUST CO (JERSEY) LTD
[2015] UKSC 72, [2016] AC 742, Supreme Court
15. As Lady Hale pointed out in 
Geys
 
v. 
Société Générale
 
[2013] 1 AC 523, para
55, there are two types of contractual implied term. The first, with which this case is
concerned, is a term which is implied into a particular contract, in the light of the
express terms, commercial common sense, and the facts known to both parties at
the time the contract was made. The second type of implied terms arises because,
unless such a term is expressly excluded, the law (sometimes by statute,
sometimes through the common law) effectively imposes certain terms into certain
classes of relationship.
16.
 
There have, of course, been many judicial observations as to the nature of
the requirements which have to be satisfied before a term can be implied into a
detailed commercial contract. They include three classic statements, which have
been frequently quoted in law books and judgments …

, all
of which are set out earlier and continued]
17. Support for the notion that a term will only be implied if it satisfies the test of
business necessity is to be found in a number of observations made in the House
of Lords. Notable examples included … Lord Wilberforce, Lord Cross, Lord
Salmon and Lord Edmund-Davies in 
Liverpool City Council
 
v.

In the Privy Council case of 
BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd
 
v. 
President,
Councillors and Ratepayers of the Shire of Hastings
 
(1977) 52 ALJR 20, [1977]
UKPC 13, 26, Lord Simon (speaking for the majority, which included Viscount
Dilhorne and Lord Keith) said that:
‘[F]or a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied: (1) it must be
reasonable and equitable; (2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy to 
the contract, so that no
term will be implied if the contract is effective without it; (3) it must be so obvious that “it goes without
saying”; (4) it must be capable of clear expression; (5) it must not contradict any express term of the
contract.’
19. In 
Philips Electronique Grand Public SA
 
v. 
British Sky Broadcasting Ltd
 
[1995]
EMLR 472, 481, Sir Thomas Bingham MR set out Lord Simon’s formulation, and
described it as a summary which ‘distil[led] the essence of much learning on
implied terms’ but whose ‘simplicity could be almost misleading’. Sir Thomas then
explained that it was ‘difficult to infer with confidence what the parties must have
intended when they have entered into a lengthy and carefully-drafted contract but
have omitted to make provision for the matter in issue’, because ‘it may well be
doubtful whether the omission was the result of the parties’ oversight or of their
deliberate decision’, or indeed the parties might suspect that ‘they are unlikely to
agree on what is to happen in a certain … eventuality’ and ‘may well choose to
leave the matter uncovered in their contract in the hope that the eventuality will not
occur’. Sir Thomas went on to say this at p. 482:
‘The question of whether a term should be implied, and if so what, almost inevitably arises after a crisis
has been reached in the performance of the contract. So the court comes to the task of implication with
the benefit of hindsight, and it is tempting for the court then to fashion a term which will reflect the merits
of the situation as they then appear. Tempting, but wrong. [He then quoted the observations of Scrutton
LJ in 
Reigate
, and continued] [I] t is not enough to show that had the parties foreseen the eventuality
which in fact occurred they would have wished to make provision for it, unless it can also be shown
either that there was only one contractual solution or that one of several possible solutions would without
doubt have been preferred …’
…
21. In my judgment, the judicial observations so far considered represent a clear,
consistent and principled approach. It could be dangerous to reformulate the
principles, but I would add six comments on the summary given by Lord Simon in
BP Refinery
 
as extended by Sir Thomas Bingham in 
Philips
. … First, in 
Equitable
Life Assurance Society
 
v. 
Hyman
 
[2002] 1 AC 408, 459, Lord Steyn rightly
observed that the implication of a term was ‘not critically dependent on proof of an
actual intention of the parties’ when negotiating the contract. If one approaches the
question by reference to what the parties would have agreed, one is not strictly
concerned with the hypothetical answer of the actual parties, but with that of
notional reasonable people in the position of the parties at the time at which they
were contracting. Secondly, a term should not be implied into a detailed
commercial contract merely because it appears fair or merely because one
considers that the parties would have agreed it if it had been suggested to them.
Those are necessary but not sufficient grounds for including a term. However, and
thirdly, it is questionable whether Lord Simon’s first requirement, reasonableness
and equitableness, will usually, if ever, add anything: if a term satisfies the other
requirements, it is hard to think that it would not be reasonable and equitable.
Fourthly, as Lord Hoffmann I think suggested in 
Attorney General of Belize
 
v.
Belize Telecom Ltd
 
[2009] 1 WLR 1988, para 27, although Lord Simon’s
requirements are otherwise cumulative, I would accept that business necessity and
obviousness, his second and third requirements, can be alternatives in the sense
that only one of them needs to be satisfied, although I suspect that in practice it
would be a rare case where only one of those two requirements would be satisfied.
Fifthly, if one approaches the issue by reference to the officious bystander, it is
‘vital to formulate the question to be posed by [him] with the utmost care’, to quote
from Lewison, 
The Interpretation of Contracts
 
5th ed (2011), para 6.09. Sixthly,
necessity for business efficacy involves a value judgment. It is rightly 
common
ground on this appeal that the test is not one of ‘absolute necessity’, not least
because the necessity is judged by reference to business efficacy. It may well be
that a more helpful way of putting Lord Simon’s second requirement is, as
suggested by Lord Sumption in argument, that a term can only be implied if,
without the term, the contract would lack commercial or practical coherence.
22.
 
Before leaving this issue of general principle, it is appropriate to refer a
little further to 
Belize Telecom
, where Lord Hoffmann suggested that the process of
implying terms into a contract was part of the exercise of the construction, or
interpretation, of the contract. In summary, he said at para 21 that ‘[t] here is only
one question: is that what the instrument, read as a whole against the relevant
background, would reasonably be understood to mean?’. There are two points to
be made about that observation.
23.
 
First, the notion that a term will be implied if a reasonable reader of the
contract, knowing all its provisions and the surrounding circumstances, would
understand it to be implied is quite acceptable, provided that (i) the reasonable
reader is treated as reading the contract at the time it was made and (ii) he would
consider the term to be so obvious as to go without saying or to be necessary for
business efficacy. (The difference between what the reasonable reader would
understand and what the parties, acting reasonably, would agree, appears to me to
be a notional distinction without a practical difference.) The first proviso
emphasises that the question whether a term is implied is to be judged at the date
the contract is made. The second proviso is important because otherwise Lord
Hoffmann’s formulation may be interpreted as suggesting that reasonableness is a
sufficient ground for implying a term. (For the same reason, it would be wrong to
treat Lord Steyn’s statement in 
Equitable Life Assurance Society
 
v. 
Hyman
 
[2002] 1
AC 408, 459 that a term will be implied if it is ‘essential to give effect to the
reasonable expectations of the parties’ as diluting the test of necessity. That is
clear from what Lord Steyn said earlier on the same page, namely that ‘[t]he legal
test for the implication of … a term is … strict necessity’, which he described as a
‘stringent test’.)
24.
 
It is necessary to emphasise that there has been no dilution of the
requirements which have to be satisfied before a term will be implied, because it is
apparent that 
Belize Telecom
 
has been interpreted by both academic lawyers and
judges as having changed the law … the law governing the circumstances in which
a term will be implied into a contract remains unchanged following 
Belize Telecom.
25.
 
The second point to be made about what was said in 
Belize Telecom
concerns the suggestion that the process of implying a term is part of the exercise
of interpretation …
26.
 
I accept that both (i) construing the words which the parties have used in
their contract and (ii) implying terms into the contract, involve determining the
scope and meaning of the contract. However, Lord Hoffmann’s analysis in 
Belize
Telecom
 
could obscure the fact that construing the words used and implying
additional words are different processes governed by different rules.
27.
 
Of course, it is fair to say that the factors to be taken into account on an
issue of construction, namely the words used in the contract, the surrounding
circumstances known to both parties at the time of the contract, commercial
common sense, and the reasonable reader or reasonable parties, are also taken
into account on an issue of implication. However, that does not mean that the
exercise of implication should be properly classified as part of the exercise of
interpretation, let alone that it should be carried out at the same time as
interpretation. When one is implying a term or a phrase, one is not construing
words, as the words to be implied are 
ex hypothesi
 
not there to be construed; and
to speak of construing the contract as a whole, including the implied terms, is not
helpful, not least because it begs the question as to what construction actually
means in this context.
28.
 
In most, possibly all, disputes about whether a term should be implied into
a contract, it is only after the process of construing the express words is complete
that the issue of an implied term falls to be considered. Until one has decided what
the parties have expressly agreed, it is difficult to see how one can set about
deciding whether a term should be implied and if so what term. This appeal is just
such a case. Further, given that it is a cardinal rule that no term can be implied into
a contract if it contradicts an express term, it would seem logically to follow that,
until the express terms of a contract have been construed, it is, at least normally,
not sensibly possible to decide whether a further term should be implied. Having
said that, I accept Lord Carnwath’s point in para 71 to the extent that in some
cases it could conceivably be appropriate to reconsider the interpretation of the
express terms of a contract once one has decided whether to imply a term, but,
even if that is right, it does not alter the fact that the express terms of a contract
must be interpreted before one can consider any question of implication.
29.
 
In any event, the process of implication involves a rather different exercise
from that of construction. As Sir Thomas Bingham trenchantly explained in 
Philips
at p 481:
‘The courts’ usual role in contractual interpretation is, by resolving ambiguities or reconciling apparent
inconsistencies, to attribute the true meaning to the language in which the parties themselves have
expressed their contract. The implication of contract terms involves a different and altogether more
ambitious undertaking: the interpolation of terms to deal with matters for which, 
ex hypothesi
, the parties
themselves have made no provision. It is because the implication of terms is so potentially intrusive that
the law imposes strict constraints on the exercise of this extraordinary power.’
…
31. It is true that 
Belize Telecom
 
was a unanimous decision of the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council and that the judgment was given by Lord
Hoffmann, whose contributions in so many areas of law have been outstanding.
However, it is apparent that Lord Hoffmann’s observations in 
Belize Telecom
,
paras 17–27 are open to more than one interpretation on the two points identified
in paras 23–24 and 25–30 above, and that some of those interpretations are wrong
in law. In those circumstances, the right course for us to take is to say that those
observations should henceforth be treated as a characteristically inspired
discussion rather than authoritative guidance on the law of implied terms.
Commentary
The principal significance of the decision of the Supreme Court lies in its clear
affirmation that the test for the implication of a term into a contract as a matter of fact is
based upon necessity, not reasonableness (see [24] and also the judgments of Lord
Carnwath and Lord Clarke at [66] and [77] respectively). It is not enough to show that
the term is a reasonable one for it to be implied into the contract ([23]), nor does it
suffice to show that the term appears to be a fair one to have implied or that it is one
that the parties might have agreed to had it been suggested to them ([21]). The test
remains one of necessity, albeit not ‘absolute necessity’ but whether, without the term,
the contract would lack commercial or practical coherence ([21]) or whether it is
necessary to imply the term ‘in order to make the contract work’ (see Lord Clarke at
[77]). The need to re-assert that the test is one based on necessity arose principally
because some judges and commentators believed that Lord Hoffmann in 
Attorney-
General 
of Belize
 
v. 
Belize Telecom Ltd
 
[2009] UKPC 10, [2009] 1 WLR 1988 had
attempted to liberalize the rules relating to the implication of terms into a contract
([24]). It is unlikely that this was the intention of Lord Hoffmann but, in any event, the
point has now been established beyond all doubt that the test remains one based on
necessity and this has been acknowledged in subsequent case-law where the courts have
affirmed the strict requirements which must be satisfied before a term will be implied as
a matter of fact into a contract, particularly a written contract of some length which has
been negotiated with the benefit of legal advice (see, for example, 
Impact Funding
Solutions Ltd
 
v. 
Barrington Support Services Ltd (AIG Europe Ltd, Third Party)
 
[2016]
UKSC 57, [2017] AC 73, [31] and 
Ali
 
v. 
Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago
[2017] UKPC 2, [2017] ICR 531, [5]) so that the courts now approach the implication of
terms into such a contract ‘with caution’ (
Ukraine
 
v. 
The Law Debenture Trust
Corporation plc
 
[2018] EWCA Civ 2026, [2019] QB 1121, [205]). When deciding
whether the term is necessary to make the contract work or to give the contract practical
or commercial coherence, the court must endeavour to put itself in the position of the
parties at the time of entry into the contract. It is not appropriate for the court to rely on
hindsight and to imply a term into a contract because it appears to the court to be fair or
because it is believed that the parties would have agreed to the term if it had been
suggested to them (
Bou-Simon
 
v. 
BGC Brokers LP
 
[2018] EWCA Civ 1525, [2019] 1 All
ER (Comm) 955, [12]). It is also no easy task to demonstrate that without the implied
term the contract lacks practical or commercial coherence. In particular, the fact that
the contract has turned out to be a less advantageous bargain for one of the parties is not
sufficient to establish that the contract is practically or commercially incoherent without
the suggested implied term (
Yoo Design Services Ltd v Iliv Realty Pte Ltd
 
[2021] EWCA
Civ 560).
The second point of note which emerges from the decision of the Supreme Court relates
to the doubt cast upon the proposition, central to the judgment of Lord Hoffmann in
Belize
, that ‘the process of implying a term is part of the exercise of interpretation’. Lord
Neuberger’s criticisms (at [25]–[31]), combined with his pointed remark that Lord
Hoffmann’s judgment was to be considered as a ‘characteristically inspired discussion’
rather than ‘authoritative guidance’ ([31]) should, notwithstanding Lord Carnwath’s
continuing support for the approach of Lord Hoffmann (at [74]), consign Lord
Hoffmann’s analysis to a mere footnote in the development of the law relating to implied
terms. Support for the latter proposition can be derived from 
Trump International Golf
Club Scotland Ltd
 
v. 
The Scottish Ministers
 
[2015] UKSC 74, [2016] 1 WLR 85, where
Lord Hodge stated (at [35]) that ‘interpretation is not the same as the implication of
terms’ and that ‘interpretation of the words of a document is the precursor of
implication’. Lord Mance was, however, more circumspect in his observations on the
relationship between implication and interpretation. Thus he observed (at [42]) that he
‘would not encourage advocates or courts to adopt too rigid or sequential an approach to
the processes of consideration of the express terms and of consideration of the
possibility of an implication’ and concluded (at [44]) that it appears to be ‘helpful’ to
recognize ‘in broad terms’ that ‘the processes of consideration of express terms and of
the possibility that an implication exists are all part of an overall, and potentially
iterative, process of objective interpretation of the contract as a whole’. Notwithstanding
the tentative support of Lord Mance for the approach of Lord Hoffmann, it is suggested
that Lord Hodge is correct to state that interpretation is the precursor to implication. In
other words, the court must first ascertain the meaning of the express terms of the
contract, and it is only once that task has been completed that the court should turn to
the question whether or not it is appropriate to imply a term into the contract. The
sequential nature of this exercise derives support from the rule that the courts cannot
imply a term into a contract which is inconsistent, whether 
linguistically or in terms of
substance, with the express terms of the contract (
Irish Bank Resolution Corporation
Ltd
 
v. 
Camden Markets Holding Corp
 
[2017] EWCA Civ 7). The latter rule suggests that
the court must first ascertain the scope of the express terms of the contract because it is
only once that task has been completed that the court can meaningfully ask whether the
proposed implied term is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract (
Duval v
11-13 Randolph Crescent Ltd
 
[2020] UKSC 18, [2020] AC 845, [26] and [51]). Were the
two processes of interpretation and implication to be carried out simultaneously the
result would in all probability be confusion rather than clarity.
Although interpretation and implication are different processes which are governed by
different rules, the Privy Council in 
Byron
 
v. 
Eastern Caribbean Amalgamated Bank
[2019] UKPC 16, [22] recognized that the factors taken into account in each process may
be the same. Thus both have regard to the words used, the surrounding circumstances
known to both parties at the time of entry into the contract, and considerations of
commercial common sense. But it does not follow from the existence of common factors
that the processes are identical. As Lady Hale put it (at [22]), construing the words of
the contract ‘involves deciding what the parties meant by what they did say’, while
implication ‘involves deciding whether they would have said something that they did not
in fact say had the matter occurred to them’. On this basis ‘until one has decided what
the parties meant by what they did say, it will be difficult to set out about deciding what
they would have said’.
However, in the case where the contract is made orally or by conduct it may not be so
easy to draw such a clear line of distinction between interpretation and implication.
Thus in 
Wells
 
v. 
Devani
 
[2019] UKSC 4, [2020] AC 129 (on which see 
4.1
) Lord Kitchin
stated (at [28]) that ‘in most cases’ a court will only consider the implication of a term
into a contract after it has completed the process of interpreting the express words of the
agreement and, to similar effect, Lord Briggs stated (at [59]) that ‘very often’
interpretation will precede implication. A factor which may have persuaded Lord
Kitchin and Lord Briggs to express themselves in more qualified terms is that the
contract in 
Wells
 
was made partly orally and partly by conduct. Further, the term which
was in dispute in that case was not agreed as part of the oral conversation between the
parties but was based on the conduct of the parties and the practice of the property
market more generally. In such a case, it may not be entirely easy to ascertain whether
the term is identified as a matter of interpretation of what was said and done by the
parties or whether it is based on the implication of a term into the contract to fill the gap
in what had been expressly agreed between the parties. But these difficulties are not so
acute in the context of a written contract which has been agreed between the parties
where, for the reasons given by Lady Hale in 
Byron
, a distinction can meaningfully be
drawn between interpretation and implication.
The third point to note regarding the decision of the Supreme Court relates to its
application of the principles of law to the facts of the case. The question before the court
was whether it should imply into a lease a term which entitled the lessee to recover that
part of an advance payment of rent which related to a period after the exercise by the
lessee of a break period in the lease. The lessee paid the full quarter’s rent due on 25
December 2011 but on 24 January 2012 exercised its right under the break clause to
determine the lease. The lessee then sought to recover the rent attributable to the period
between 24 January 2012 and the end of the quarter, being 24 March 2012. The
Supreme Court declined to imply the proposed term into the lease and it did so for two
principal reasons. First, the lease was a very detailed document which had been entered
into between two substantial and experienced parties and had been negotiated and
drafted by expert solicitors ([38]). Further, the lease made provision for a number of
contingencies, but it did not make provision for the return of the balance of an advance
payment of rent in the circumstances of this particular case 
([39]). Secondly, the
existence of such an implied term was not supported by ‘the general attitude of the law
to the apportionability of rent payable in advance’ ([42]). On the contrary, the long-
established rule of the common law is that rent, whether payable in arrear or in advance,
is not apportionable in time. Given that this was the background rule of law and the
parties’ expert advisors had not seen fit to insert such a term expressly into the contract,
the Supreme Court declined to imply the term.
The final point to note is that Lord Neuberger affirmed the continuing importance of the
distinction between a term implied in law and a term implied in fact ([15]). Cases in
which it is sought to imply a term into a particular type of contract as a matter of law
raise rather more difficult issues, to which we now turn.
10.4.2
 
Terms Implied in Law
The basis on which terms are implied into contracts as a matter of law has given rise to
considerable difficulty. It would appear that the test applied by the courts in this context
is less rigorous than in the context of terms implied in fact, but the difference would
appear to be one of degree, not kind. The controversy that exists in this area of law can
best be seen by examining one of the leading cases, 
Liverpool City Council
 
v. 
Irwin
, a
case which is notable for the contrast between the reasoning of Lord Denning in the
Court of Appeal and Lord Wilberforce in the House of Lords.
LIVERPOOL CITY COUNCIL V. IRWIN
[1976] QB 319, Court of Appeal; [1977] AC 239, House of Lords
The defendant tenants lived in Haigh Heights, a tower block in the district of
Everton in Liverpool. The plaintiffs, Liverpool City Council, were their landlords.
The defendants stopped paying rent for their maisonette on the ninth and tenth
floors of the tower block. The plaintiffs brought an action for possession. The
defendants counterclaimed for nominal damages of £10 for (i) breach of the
landlord’s duty to repair and maintain the common parts of the building retained by
the plaintiffs, namely the lifts, staircases, passages, rubbish chutes, playground,
etc. and in relation to the maisonette itself; (ii) breach of the covenant for quiet
enjoyment; and (iii) breach of the implied covenant in section 32(1) of the Housing
Act 1961, specifying defects in and disrepair of the water closet cisterns, damp,
defective door frames, and related matters. The plaintiffs denied the existence of
any implied obligation to keep the common parts of the building in repair and they
also denied breaches of the covenant for quiet enjoyment and of the covenant
implied under section 32(1). The trial judge held that the plaintiffs were in breach of
all three duties and, while he granted the council an order for possession, he
awarded the defendants nominal damages of £10.
The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed
their appeal. It held by a majority (Lord Denning MR dissenting) that the plaintiffs
were not under any contractual duty to keep the common parts in repair and,
further, that they were not in breach of the implied covenant in section 32(1) of the
Housing Act 1961. The majority refused to imply a term into the tenancy contract to
the effect that the plaintiffs would keep the common parts in repair on the ground
that it was not necessary to imply such an onerous obligation into the tenancy
agreement in order to give it business efficacy. Lord Denning took a different
approach. He held that the plaintiffs were subject to an implied duty to take
reasonable care to 
keep the common parts reasonably fit for use by the tenants
but that the tenants had failed to prove that the plaintiffs had not exercised
reasonable care. He therefore concurred in the result, namely that the defendants
were not entitled to recover damages from the plaintiffs.
The defendants appealed to the House of Lords. The House of Lords allowed
their appeal in part. Their appeal was successful in relation to their claim pursuant
to section 32(1) of the Housing Act 1961 and it was held that they were entitled to
nominal damages of £5. In relation to their claim that the plaintiffs were in breach
of their duty to keep the common parts of the building in repair, the House of Lords
held that the plaintiffs were subject to an obligation to take reasonable care to do
so but that, on the facts, they had not breached that duty.
Two extracts from the case are set out here. The first is taken from the
dissenting judgment of Lord Denning MR in the Court of Appeal and the second
from the speech of Lord Wilberforce in the House of Lords. The extracts do not
deal with the scope of section 32(1) of the Housing Act 1961. They deal only with
the defendants’ submission that the plaintiffs were in breach of their implied duty to
keep the common parts of the building in repair.
Lord Denning MR
It is often said that the courts only imply a term in a contract when it is reasonable
and necessary to do so in order to give business efficacy to the transaction: see

when it is obvious that both parties must have intended it: so obvious indeed that if
an officious bystander had asked them whether there was to be such a term, both
would have suppressed it testily: ‘Yes, of course’: see

If you read the discussion in those cases, you will see that in none of them did
the court ask: what did both parties intend? If asked, each party would have said
he never gave it a thought: or the one would have intended something different
from the other. Nor did the court ask: Is it necessary to give business efficacy to
the transaction? If asked, the answer would have been: ‘It is reasonable, but it is
not necessary’. The judgments in all those cases show that the courts implied a
term according to whether or not it was reasonable in all the circumstances to do
so. Very often it was conceded that there was some implied term. The only
question was: ‘What was the extent of it?’ Such as, was it an absolute warranty of
fitness, or only a promise to use reasonable care? That cannot be solved by
inquiring what they both intended, or into what was necessary. But only into what
was reasonable. This is to be decided as matter of law, not as matter of fact. Lord
Wright pulled the blinkers off our eyes when he said in 1935 to the Holdsworth
Club:
‘The truth is that the court … decides this question in accordance with what seems to be just or
reasonable in its eyes. The judge finds in himself the criterion of what is reasonable. 
The court is in this
sense making a contract for the parties—though it is almost blasphemy to say so.’ (Lord Wright of
Durley, 
Legal Essays and Addresses
 
(1939), p. 259.)
In 1956, Lord Radcliffe put it elegantly when he said of the parties to an implied
term:
‘their actual persons should be allowed to rest in peace. In their place there rises the figure of the fair
and reasonable man. And the spokesman of the fair and reasonable man, who represents after all no
more than the anthropomorphic conception of justice, is and must be the court itself’: see 
Davis
Contractors Ltd
 
v. 
Fareham Urban District Council
 
[1956] AC 696, 728.
In 1969, Lord Reid put it simply when he said: ‘ … no warranty ought to be implied
in a contract unless it is in all the circumstances reasonable,’ see 
Young & Marten
Ltd
 
v. 
McManus Childs Ltd
 
[1969] 1 AC 454, 465: and Lord Upjohn echoed it when
he said, at p. 471, that the implied warranty was ‘imposed by law’.
Is there a term to be implied in this tenancy about the lifts and staircases and
other common parts? …
[He considered the case-law and other authorities and concluded]
It is clearly the duty of the landlord, not only to take care to keep the lifts and
staircase safe, but also to take care to keep them reasonably fit for the use of the
tenant and his visitors. If the lifts break down, the landlord ought to repair them. If
the lights on the staircase fail, the landlord ought to replace them.
[He then considered whether or not there had been a breach of the duty and
concluded that, on the facts, there had been no breach.]
Lord Wilberforce
We have then a contract which is partly, but not wholly, stated in writing. In order to
complete it, in particular to give it a bilateral character, it is necessary to take
account of the actions of the parties and the circumstances. As actions of the
parties, we must note the granting of possession by the landlords and reservation
by them of the ‘common parts’—stairs, lifts, chutes, etc. As circumstances we must
include the nature of the premises, viz., a maisonette for family use on the ninth
floor of a high block, one which is occupied by a large number of other tenants, all
using the common parts and dependent upon them, none of them having any
expressed obligation to maintain or repair them.
To say that the construction of a complete contract out of these elements
involves a process of ‘implication’ may be correct; it would be so if implication
means the supplying of what is not expressed. But there are varieties of
implications which the courts think fit to make and they do not necessarily involve
the same process. Where there is, on the face of it, a complete, bilateral contract,
the courts are sometimes willing to add terms to it, as implied terms: this is very
common in mercantile contracts where there is an established usage: in that case
the courts are spelling out what both parties know and would, if asked,
unhesitatingly agree to be part of the bargain. In other cases, where there is an
apparently complete bargain, the courts are willing to add a term on the ground
that without it the contract will not work—this is the case, if not of 
The Moorcock
(1889) 14 PD 64 itself on its facts, at least of the doctrine of 
The Moorcock
 
as
usually applied. This is, as was pointed out by the majority in the Court of Appeal, a
strict test—though the degree of strictness seems to vary with the current legal
trend—and I think that they were right not to accept it as applicable here. There is
a third variety of implication, that which I think Lord Denning MR favours, or at least
did favour in this case, and that is the implication of reasonable terms. But though I
agree with 
many of his instances, which in fact fall under one or other of the
preceding heads, I cannot go so far as to endorse his principle; indeed, it seems to
me, with respect, to extend a long, and undesirable, way beyond sound authority.
The present case, in my opinion, represents a fourth category, or I would rather
say a fourth shade on a continuous spectrum. The court here is simply concerned
to establish what the contract is, the parties not having themselves fully stated the
terms. In this sense the court is searching for what must be implied.
What then should this contract be held to be? There must first be implied a
letting, that is, a grant of the right of exclusive possession to the tenants. With this
there must, I would suppose, be implied a covenant for quiet enjoyment, as a
necessary incident of the letting. The difficulty begins when we consider the
common parts. We start with the fact that the demise is useless unless access is
obtained by the staircase; we can add that, having regard to the height of the
block, and the family nature of the dwellings, the demise would be useless without
a lift service; we can continue that, there being rubbish chutes built into the
structures and no other means of disposing of light rubbish, there must be a right
to use the chutes. The question to be answered—and it is the only question in this
case—is what is to be the legal relationship between landlord and tenant as
regards these matters.
There can be no doubt that there must be implied (i) an easement for the
tenants and their licensees to use the stairs, (ii) a right in the nature of an
easement to use the lifts, (iii) an easement to use the rubbish chutes.
But are these easements to be accompanied by any obligation upon the
landlord, and what obligation? There seem to be two alternatives. The first, for
which the council contends, is for an easement coupled with no legal obligation,
except such as may arise under the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 as regards the
safety of those using the facilities, and possibly such other liability as might exist
under the ordinary law of tort. The alternative is for easements coupled with some
obligation on the part of the landlords as regards the maintenance of the subject of
them, so that they are available for use.
My Lords, in order to be able to choose between these, it is necessary to define
what test is to be applied, and I do not find this difficult. In my opinion such
obligation should be read into the contract as the nature of the contract itself
implicitly requires, no more, no less: a test, in other words, of necessity. The
relationship accepted by the corporation is that of landlord and tenant: the tenant
accepts obligations accordingly, in relation inter alia to the stairs, the lifts and the
chutes. All these are not just facilities, or conveniences provided at discretion: they
are essentials of the tenancy without which life in the dwellings, as a tenant, is not
possible. To leave the landlord free of contractual obligation as regards these
matters, and subject only to administrative or political pressure, is, in my opinion,
inconsistent totally with the nature of this relationship. The subject matter of the
lease (high rise blocks) and the relationship created by the tenancy demand, of
their nature, some contractual obligation on the landlord.
I do not think that this approach involves any innovation as regards the law of
contract. The necessity to have regard to the inherent nature of a contract and of
the relationship thereby established was stated in this House in 
Lister
 
v. 
Romford
Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd
 
[1957] AC 555. That was a case between master and
servant and of a search for an ‘implied term’. Viscount Simonds, at p. 579, makes
a clear distinction between a search for an implied term such as might be
necessary to give ‘business efficacy’ to the particular contract and a search, based
on wider considerations, for such a term as the nature of the contract might call for,
or as a legal incident of this kind of contract. If the search were for the former, he
says, ‘ … I should lose myself in the attempt to formulate it with the necessary
precision’. (p. 576.) We see an echo of this in the present case, when the majority
in the Court of Appeal, considering 
a ‘business efficacy term’—i.e., a ‘Moorcock’
term (
The Moorcock
, 14 PD 64)—found themselves faced with five alternative
terms and therefore rejected all of them. But that is not, in my opinion, the end, or
indeed the object, of the search.
We have some guidance in authority for the kind of term which this typical
relationship (of landlord and tenant in a multi-occupational dwelling) requires in
Miller
 
v. 
Hancock
 
[1893] 2 QB 177. There Bowen LJ said, at pp. 180–181:
‘The tenants could only use their flats by using the staircase. The defendant, therefore, when he let the
flats, impliedly granted to the tenants an easement over the staircase, which he retained in his own
occupation, for the purpose of the enjoyment of the flats so let. Under those circumstances, what is the
law as to the repairs of the staircase? It was contended by the defendant’s counsel that, according to the
common law, the person in enjoyment of an easement is bound to do the necessary repairs himself.
That may be true with regard to easements in general, but it is subject to the qualification that the grantor
of the easement may undertake to do the repairs either in express terms or by necessary implication.
This is not the mere case of a grant of an easement without special circumstances. It appears to me
obvious, when one considers what a flat of this kind is, and the only way in which it can be enjoyed, that
the parties to the demise of it must have intended by necessary implication, as a basis without which the
whole transaction would be futile, that the landlord should maintain the staircase, which is essential to
the enjoyment of the premises demised, and should keep it reasonably safe for the use of the tenants,
and also of those persons who would necessarily go up and down the stairs in the ordinary course of
business with the tenants; because, of course, a landlord must know when he lets a flat that tradesmen
and other persons having business with the tenant must have access to it. It seems to me that it would
render the whole transaction inefficacious and absurd if an implied undertaking were not assumed on the
part of the landlord to maintain the staircase so far as might be necessary for the reasonable enjoyment
of the demised premises.’
Certainly that case, as a decision concerning a claim by a visitor, has been
overruled: 
Fairman
 
v. 
Perpetual Investment Building Society
 
[1923] AC 74. But I
cite the passage for its common sense as between landlord and tenant, and you
cannot overrule common sense.
There are other passages in which the same thought has been expressed …
These are all reflections of what necessarily arises whenever a landlord lets
portions of a building for multiple occupation, retaining essential means of access.
I accept, of course, the argument that a mere grant of an easement does not
carry with it any obligation on the part of the servient owner to maintain the subject
matter. The dominant owner must spend the necessary money, for example in
repairing a drive leading to his house and the same principle may apply when a
landlord lets an upper floor with access by a staircase: responsibility for
maintenance may well rest on the tenant. But there is a difference between that
case and the case where there is an essential means of access, retained in the
landlord’s occupation, to units in a building of multi-occupation, for unless the
obligation to maintain is, in a defined manner, placed upon the tenants, individually
or collectively, the nature of the contract, and the circumstances, require that it be
placed on the landlord.
It remains to define the standard. My Lords, if, as I think, the test of the
existence of the term is necessity the standard must surely not exceed what is
necessary having regard to the circumstances. To imply an absolute obligation to
repair would go beyond what is a necessary legal incident and would indeed be
unreasonable. An obligation to take reasonable care to keep in reasonable repair
and usability is what fits the requirements of the case. Such a definition involves—
and I think rightly—recognition that the tenants themselves have their
responsibilities. What it is reasonable to expect of a landlord has a clear relation to
what a reasonable set of tenants should do for themselves.
I add one word as to lighting. In general I would accept that a grant of an
easement of passage does not carry with it an obligation on the grantor to light the
way. The grantee must take the way accompanied by the primeval separation of
darkness from light and if he passes during the former must bring his own
illumination. … But the case may be different when the means of passage are
constructed, and when natural light is either absent or insufficient. In such a case,
to the extent that the easement is useless without some artificial light being
provided, the grant should carry with it an obligation to take reasonable care to
maintain adequate lighting—comparable to the obligation as regards the lifts. To
impose an absolute obligation would be unreasonable; to impose some might be
necessary. We have not sufficient material before us to see whether the present
case on its facts meets these conditions.
I would hold therefore that the landlords’ obligation is as I have described and
in agreement, I believe, with your Lordships I would hold that it has not been
shown in this case that there was any breach of that obligation. On the main point
therefore I would hold that the appeal fails.
My Lords, it will be seen that I have reached exactly the same conclusion as
that of Lord Denning MR, with most of whose thinking I respectfully agree. I must
only differ from the passage in which, more adventurously, he suggests that the
courts have power to introduce into contracts any terms they think reasonable or to
anticipate legislative recommendations of the Law Commission. A just result can
be reached, if I am right, by a less dangerous route.
Commentary
The term sought to be implied into the tenancy agreement was one which related to the
obligation of the landlord to keep the common parts of the tower block in repair and
properly lit. Two principal issues arose in relation to this term. The first was whether or
not such an obligation should be implied into the tenancy agreement at all and the
second was, if such a term was to be implied, what was its scope? Was it an obligation to
take reasonable care to keep the tower block in repair or was it a stricter obligation? The
House of Lords concluded that a term was to be implied, that it required the plaintiffs to
exercise reasonable care, and that, on the facts, the plaintiffs had not breached their
duty.
Two further points are worthy of note. The first relates to the test to be applied when
deciding whether or not to imply a term into the contract. Lord Denning advocated a
test based on reasonableness but the House of Lords rejected his analysis. Lord
Wilberforce did so in a rather restrained fashion in the final extracted paragraph of his
speech. Some of the other judges in the House of Lords were more robust. Thus Lord
Salmon stated (at p. 262):
I cannot go so far as Lord Denning MR and hold that the courts have any power to imply a term into a contract
merely because it seems reasonable to do so. Indeed, I think that such a proposition is contrary to all authority.
To say, as Lord Reid said in 
Young & Marten Ltd
 
v. 
McManus Childs Ltd
 
[1969] 1 AC 454, 465, that ‘ … no
warranty ought to be implied in a contract unless it is in all the circumstances reasonable’ is, in my view, quite
different from saying that any warranty or term which is, in all the circumstances, reasonable ought to be
implied in a contract. I am confident that Lord Reid meant no more than that unless a warranty or term is in all
the circumstances reasonable there can be no question of implying it into a contract, but before it is implied
much else besides is necessary, for example that without it the contract would be inefficacious, futile and
absurd.
Lord Edmund-Davies stated (at p. 266) that the ‘touchstone is always 
necessity
 
and not
merely 
reasonableness
’. The difficulty with the ‘necessity’ analysis relates to its
application to the facts. Was it really ‘necessary’ to imply such a term into the tenancy
agreement? The reality would appear to be that the House of Lords was deciding a
matter of social policy in relation to the extent of the obligations that are to be imposed
upon landlords. Are they expected to keep the common parts in repair and to provide
facilities to their tenants? If they are, what is the scope of their duty? Are they liable even
in the case where the problems were caused by vandals who damaged the lifts and
removed the light bulbs from the stairs? It is by no means clear that there is a ‘necessary’
answer to these questions. The point has been well made (Atiyah’s 
An Introduction to
the Law of Contract
 
(6th edn, Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 161) in the following
terms:
[T]he difference between the judges on this point seems somewhat unreal … It is obviously not strictly or
literally 
necessary
 
to have lifts in blocks of flats ten storeys high, though it would no doubt be exceedingly
inconvenient not to have them. So ‘necessary’ really seems to mean ‘reasonably necessary’, and that must mean,
‘reasonably necessary having regard to the context and the price’.
There is a second aspect to 
Liverpool City Council
 
v. 
Irwin
 
which merits further
consideration and that relates to the question whether the term implied into the
contract was a term implied in law or a term implied in fact. The case is generally
regarded as an authority on terms implied in law, on the basis that the term that the
landlord was under an obligation to take reasonable care to keep the common parts in
repair was to be implied into all tenancy contracts between occupants of flats in tower
blocks and their landlords. It was not a term that was peculiar to the relationship
between this particular landlord and this particular tenant. However, it would appear
that counsel for the defendants put his case on two different bases. First, he argued that
such a term ought to be implied into all contracts of this type (in other words, it was a
term implied in law) but he also relied upon the ‘officious bystander’ test. Lord Cross of
Chelsea rejected (at p. 258) the submission that the term satisfied the ‘officious
bystander’ test but nevertheless agreed (at p. 259) that the term was to be implied as a
general incident of all contracts of this type. Thus Lord Cross seems to have concluded
that a term could not be implied as a matter of fact but that it was appropriate to imply a
term as a matter of law. If this is correct, it demonstrates that there is a difference
between the test to be applied for terms implied in fact and the test applicable to terms
implied in law.
The difficulty is that not all of the judges were as clear as Lord Cross on the distinction
between terms implied in law and terms implied in fact. This point can be made in
relation to Lord Denning’s advocacy of the reasonableness test. While he stated that
‘stacks’ of cases cannot be reconciled with the necessity test most, if not all, of the cases
that he cites in support of the proposition that reasonableness is the test applied by the
courts, are cases concerned with terms implied in law (that is to say they are terms that
are generally implied into all contracts of a particular type). Indeed, his failure to
address the distinction between terms implied in law and terms implied in fact was
criticized by Lord Cross of Chelsea (at pp. 257–258) in the following passage:
When it implies a term in a contract the court is sometimes laying down a general rule that in all contracts of a
certain type—sale of goods, master and servant, landlord and tenant and so on—some provision is to be implied
unless the parties have expressly excluded it. In deciding 
whether or not to lay down such a prima facie rule the
court will naturally ask itself whether in the general run of such cases the term in question would be one which
it would be reasonable to insert. Sometimes, however, there is no question of laying down any prima facie rule
applicable to all cases of a defined type but what the court is being in effect asked to do is to rectify a particular
—often a very detailed—contract by inserting in it a term which the parties have not expressed. Here it is not
enough for the court to say that the suggested term is a reasonable one the presence of which would make the
contract a better or fairer one; it must be able to say that the insertion of the term is necessary to give—as it is
put—‘business efficacy’ to the contract and that if its absence had been pointed out at the time both parties—
assuming them to have been reasonable men—would have agreed without hesitation to its insertion. The
distinction between the two types of case was pointed out by Viscount Simonds and Lord Tucker in their
speeches in 
Lister
 
v. 
Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd
 
[1957] AC 555, 579, 594, but I think that Lord
Denning MR in proceeding—albeit with some trepidation—to ‘kill off’ MacKinnon LJ’s ‘officious bystander’
(
Shirlaw
 
v. 
Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd
 
[1939] 2 KB 206, 227) must have overlooked it.
Lord Denning returned to his theme in 
Shell UK Ltd
 
v. 
Lostock Garage Ltd
 
[1976] 1
WLR 1187 when he sought to divide the cases into the following two categories:
Implied terms
The first category comprehends all those relationships which are of common occurrence, such as the
relationship of seller and buyer, owner and hirer, master and servant, landlord and tenant, carrier by land or by
sea, contractor for building works, and so forth. In all those relationships the courts have imposed obligations
on one party or the other, saying they are implied terms. These obligations are not founded on the intention of
the parties, actual or presumed, but on more general considerations … In such relationships the problem is not
solved by asking: what did the parties intend? Or, would they have unhesitatingly agreed to it, if asked? It is to
be solved by asking: has the law already defined the obligation or the extent of it? If so, let it be followed. If not,
look to see what would be reasonable in the general run of such cases (see by Lord Cross of Chelsea at p. 570H):
and then say what the obligation shall be. The House in 
Liverpool City Council
 
v. 
Irwin
 
[1976] 2 WLR 562 went
through that very process. They examined the existing law of landlord and tenant, in particular that relating to
easements, to see if it contained the solution to the problem; and, having found that it did not, they imposed an
obligation on the landlord to use reasonable care. In these relationships the parties can exclude or modify the
obligation by express words, but unless they do so, the obligation is a legal incident of the relationship which is
attached by the law itself and not by reason of any implied term …
The second category comprehends those cases which are not within the first category. These are cases, not of
common occurrence, in which from the particular circumstances a term is to be implied. In these cases the
implication is based on an intention imputed to the parties from their actual circumstances: see 
Luxor
(Eastbourne) Ltd
 
v. 
Cooper
 
[1941] AC 108, 137 per Lord Wright. Such an imputation is only to be made when it
is necessary to imply a term to give efficacy to the contract and make it a workable agreement in such manner as
the parties would clearly have done if they had applied their mind to the contingency which has arisen. These
are the ‘officious bystander’ type of case: see 
Lister
 
v. 
Romford Ice & Cold Storage Co
 
[1957] AC 555, 594 per
Lord Tucker. In such cases a term is not to be implied on the ground that it would be reasonable, but only when
it is necessary and can be 
formulated with a sufficient degree of precision. This was the test applied by the
majority of this court in 
Liverpool City Council
 
v. 
Irwin
 
[1976] QB 319, and they were emphatically upheld by
the House on this point; see [1976] 2 WLR 562, 571D–H by Lord Cross of Chelsea; p. 578G–579A by Lord
Edmund-Davies.
There is this point to be noted about 
Liverpool City Council
 
v. 
Irwin
. In this court the argument was only
about an implication in the second category. In the House of Lords that argument was not pursued. It was only
the first category.
In this passage Lord Denning affirms that the arguments advanced in 
Irwin
encompassed both categories but he suggests that, in the House of Lords, the arguments
were confined to the first category. Where then did the decision of the House of Lords in
Liverpool City Council
 
v. 
Irwin
 
leave the law? In the first place it re-affirmed that the
test to be applied when deciding whether or not to imply a term is based on necessity
and not simply on reasonableness. But it left some uncertainty in relation to terms
implied in law because the term implied into the tenancy contract did not seem to be a
necessary ingredient of all contracts of this type. It might have been ‘reasonably
necessary’ but not ‘necessary’. That the test for the implication of terms as a matter of
law might be slightly less stringent than that applicable to terms implied in fact is
evidenced by the fact that Lord Cross concluded that a term was not to be implied on the
basis of the officious bystander test but that it was nevertheless appropriate to imply a
term as a matter of law into all contracts of this type.
The basis on which the courts imply terms as a matter of law into contracts was further
considered by the House of Lords in the following case:
SCALLY V. SOUTHERN HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
BOARD
[1992] 1 AC 294, House of Lords
The plaintiffs brought an action against the defendants, their employers, for
damages for breach of contract, negligence, and breach of statutory duty in failing
adequately to advise and inform them about their contractual and statutory rights in
relation to the superannuation
 
scheme of which they were members. In order to
qualify for a full pension under the original scheme it was necessary for an
employee to complete forty years of contributory service. In 1975 a change was
made to the scheme which entitled employees to purchase additional years of
contributing service at advantageous rates. However this right was only
exercisable within twelve months of the change coming into force. The Department
of Health and Social Services were initially given a discretion to extend the twelve-
2
month period but that discretion was taken away in 1983 and replaced by a right
given to the employee to purchase added years at any time until two years before
an employee’s retirement on fixed and progressively less favourable terms.
The defendants failed to inform the plaintiffs of their right to purchase additional
years of service at advantageous rates. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants’
failure to do so amounted to a breach of an implied term of the contract of
employment, breach of a duty of care owed to the plaintiffs, and a breach of
statutory duty. The House of Lords held that the 
defendants had not breached their
statutory duty but that they were in breach of an implied term to take reasonable
steps to inform the employees of the existence of their right to take steps to
enhance their pension entitlement on advantageous terms. The defendants were
therefore liable in damages to the plaintiffs and the case was remitted to the trial
judge so that the losses suffered by the plaintiffs could be assessed.
Lord Bridge of Harwich
Leaving aside the claim based on breach of statutory duty … it seems to me that
the plaintiffs’ common law claims can only succeed if the duty allegedly owed to
them by their employers arose out of the contract of employment. If a duty of the
kind in question was not inherent in the contractual relationship, I do not see how it
could possibly be derived from the tort of negligence. …
In the instant case I believe that an attempt to analyse the issue in terms of the
law of tort may be positively misleading. … The strong trend of recent authority has
been to narrow the range of circumstances which the law of tort will recognise as
sufficient to impose on one person a duty of care to protect another from damage
which consists in purely economic loss …
But if the issue is analysed in contract, the starting point is quite different. Here
the express terms of the contract of employment confer a valuable right on the
employee which is, however, contingent upon his taking certain action. Where that
situation is known to the employer but not to the employee, will the law imply a
contractual obligation on the employer to take reasonable steps to bring the
existence of the contingent right to the notice of the employee? It is true that such
an implication may have the consequence of sustaining a claim for purely
economic loss. But this consideration would not furnish the essential reason for
making the implication. If there is a basis for making the implication, it must lie
rather in the consideration that the availability of the contingent right was intended
by those who drew up the terms of the contract for the benefit of the employee; but
if the existence of the contingent right never comes to his attention, he cannot
profit by it and it might, so far as he is concerned, just as well not exist.
The problem is a novel one which could not arise in the classical contractual
situation in which all the contractual terms, having been agreed between the
parties, must, ex hypothesi, have been known to both parties. But in the modern
world it is increasingly common for individuals to enter into contracts, particularly
contracts of employment, on complex terms which have been settled in the course
of negotiations between representative bodies or organisations and many details
of which the individual employee cannot be expected to know unless they are
drawn to his attention. The instant case presents an example of this phenomenon
arising in the context of the statutory provisions which regulate the operation of the
health services in Northern Ireland …
[He set out the terms of these statutory provisions, rejected a submission made
by the defendants that the obligation to notify the plaintiffs lay with the Department
of Health and Social Services and not themselves and continued]
Will the law then imply a term in the contract of employment imposing such an
obligation on the employer? The implication cannot, of course, be justified as
necessary to give business efficacy to the contract of employment as a whole. I
think there is force in the submission that, since the employee’s entitlement to
enhance his pension rights by the purchase of added years is of no effect unless
he is aware of it and since he cannot be expected to become aware of it unless it
is drawn to his attention, it is necessary to imply an obligation 
on the employer to
bring it to his attention to render efficacious the very benefit which the contractual
right to purchase added years was intended to confer. But this may be stretching
the doctrine of implication for the sake of business efficacy beyond its proper
reach. A clear distinction is drawn in the speeches of Viscount Simonds in 
Lister
 
v.
Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd
 
[1957] AC 555 and Lord Wilberforce in
Liverpool City Council
 
v. 
Irwin
 
[1977] AC 239 between the search for an implied
term necessary to give business efficacy to a particular contract and the search,
based on wider considerations, for a term which the law will imply as a necessary
incident of a definable category of contractual relationship. If any implication is
appropriate here, it is, I think, of this latter type. Carswell J accepted the
submission that any formulation of an implied term of this kind which would be
effective to sustain the plaintiffs’ claims in this case must necessarily be too wide in
its ambit to be acceptable as of general application. I believe however that this
difficulty is surmounted if the category of contractual relationship in which the
implication will arise is defined with sufficient precision. I would define it as the
relationship of employer and employee where the following circumstances obtain:
(1) the terms of the contract of employment have not been negotiated with the
individual employee but result from negotiation with a representative body or are
otherwise incorporated by reference; (2) a particular term of the contract makes
available to the employee a valuable right contingent upon action being taken by
him to avail himself of its benefit; (3) the employee cannot, in all the circumstances,
reasonably be expected to be aware of the term unless it is drawn to his attention.
I fully appreciate that the criterion to justify an implication of this kind is necessity,
not reasonableness. But I take the view that it is not merely reasonable, but
necessary, in the circumstances postulated, to imply an obligation on the employer
to take reasonable steps to bring the term of the contract in question to the
employee’s attention, so that he may be in a position to enjoy its benefit.
Accordingly I would hold that there was an implied term in each of the plaintiffs’
contracts of employment of which the boards were in each case in breach.
Lord Roskill
, 
Lord Goff of Chieveley
, 
Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle
, and 
Lord
Lowry
 
concurred.
Commentary
The implied term, as set out in the last paragraph of the speech of Lord Bridge, is
narrowly drawn. As Professor Freedland has pointed out ((1992) 21 
ILJ
 
135, 139):
[T]he implied term was confined to the case where a particular term of the contract makes available to the
employee a valuable right contingent upon action being taken by him to avail himself of its benefit, and where
the employee cannot reasonably be expected to be aware of the term unless it is drawn to his attention. There
are few if any other situations where this would occur in an employment context, except when the employee is
in the position of an investor, for example in relation to employee share purchase schemes.
While the implied term recognized is narrow in scope, Lord Bridge does acknowledge
that it is based ‘on wider considerations’ than whether the term is ‘necessary to give
business efficacy to a particular contract’. This being the case, there must be a difference
between a term implied in law, at least in the sense of a term that is implied as a
‘necessary incident of 
a definable category of contractual relationship’, and a term that is
implied as a matter of fact into a particular contractual relationship. That this is so can
be demonstrated by reference to the cases concerned with the obligation of ‘trust and
confidence’ that is implied into contracts of employment (and which is not implied into
contracts of a purely commercial nature: 
Chelsfield Advisers LLP
 
v. 
Qatari Diar Real
Estate Investment Co
 
[2015] EWHC 1322 (Ch)). The existence of this implied term was
approved by the House of Lords in 
Mahmud
 
v. 
Bank of Credit and Commerce
International SA
 
[1998] AC 20 where Lord Steyn stated (at pp. 45–46):
The implied term of mutual trust and confidence
The applicants do not rely on a term implied in fact. They do not therefore rely on an individualised term to be
implied from the particular provisions of their employment contracts considered against their specific
contextual setting. Instead they rely on a standardised term implied by law, that is, on a term which is said to be
an incident of all contracts of employment: 
Scally
 
v. 
Southern Health and Social Services Board
 
[1992] 1 AC
294, 307B. Such implied terms operate as default rules. The parties are free to exclude or modify them ….
The employee’s primary case is based on a formulation of the implied term that has been applied at first
instance and in the Court of Appeal. It imposes reciprocal duties on the employer and employee. Given that this
case is concerned with alleged obligations of an employer I will concentrate on its effect on the position of
employers. For convenience I will set out the term again. It is expressed to impose an obligation that the
employer shall not:
‘without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated and likely to destroy or
seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between employer and employee.’
… A useful anthology of the cases applying this term, or something like it, is given in 
Sweet & Maxwell’s
Encyclopedia of Employment Law
 
(looseleaf ed), vol. 1, para 1.5107, pp. 1467–1470. The evolution of the term
is a comparatively recent development. The obligation probably has its origin in the general duty of co-
operation between contracting parties: 
Hepple & O’Higgins, Employment Law
, 4th ed. (1981), pp. 134–135,
paras. 291–292. The reason for this development is part of the history of the development of employment law in
this century. The notion of a ‘master and servant’ relationship became obsolete. Lord Slynn of Hadley recently
noted ‘the changes which have taken place in the employer–employee relationship, with far greater duties
imposed on the employer than in the past, whether by statute or by judicial decision, to care for the physical,
financial and even psychological welfare of the employee’: 
Spring
 
v. 
Guardian Assurance plc
 
[1995] 2 AC 296,
335B. A striking illustration of this change is 
Scally’s
 
case [1992] 1 AC 294 … where the House of Lords implied
a term that all employees in a certain category had to be notified by an employer of their entitlement to certain
benefits. It was the change in legal culture which made possible the evolution of the implied term of trust and
confidence.
There was some debate at the hearing about the possible interaction of the implied obligation of confidence
and trust with other more specific terms implied by law. It is true that the implied term adds little to the
employee’s implied obligations to serve his employer loyally and not to act contrary to his employer’s interests.
The major importance of the implied duty of trust and confidence lies in its impact on the obligations of the
employer: Douglas Brodie, ‘Recent Cases, Commentary, The Heart of the Matter: Mutual Trust and Confidence’
(1996) 25 
ILJ
 
121. And the implied obligation as formulated is apt to cover the great diversity of 
situations in
which a balance has to be struck between an employer’s interest in managing his business as he sees fit and the
employee’s interest in not being unfairly and improperly exploited.
The evolution of the implied term of trust and confidence is a fact. It has not yet been endorsed by your
Lordships’ House. It has proved a workable principle in practice. It has not been the subject of adverse criticism
in any decided cases and it has been welcomed in academic writings. I regard the emergence of the implied
obligation of mutual trust and confidence as a sound development.
In the light of 
Scally
 
and 
Mahmud
 
it seems appropriate to conclude that the test applied
by the courts in cases of terms implied in law is not based on necessity alone. It seems to
be based on a slightly lower standard which entitles the court to take account of ‘wider
considerations’. That this is so can be demonstrated by reference to the following two
decisions.
The first is the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Paragon Finance plc
 
v. 
Nash
 
[2001]
EWCA Civ 1466, [2002] 1 WLR 685. The claimant made secured loans to the defendants
in 1987 and 1990. Both agreements contained variable interest clauses. The claimant
claimed possession from the defendants on the ground that the defendants were in
arrears with their mortgage payments. The defendants defended the claim on a number
of grounds. One of the issues before the Court of Appeal was whether or not the
claimant’s power to set the interest rates from time to time was completely unfettered.
The Court of Appeal held that it was not. A term was to be implied into both agreements
to the effect that the rates of interest would not be set dishonestly, for an improper
purpose, capriciously or arbitrarily, or in a way in which no reasonable mortgagee,
acting reasonably, would do. 
Paragon Finance
 
is a fascinating case because it
demonstrates the willingness of the courts in a private law claim to draw on the analogy
of public law for the purpose of placing limits on the discretionary power of a
contracting party. On what basis did the Court of Appeal see fit to imply this term into
the contract? Was it on the basis of necessity? While some limit on the power of the
creditor to vary interest rates is clearly highly desirable, it is not clear that it can be said
to be necessary. Dyson LJ, on the other hand, stated (at [36]) that the implied term was
‘necessary to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties’. However, it would
appear that the driving force behind the recognition of the implied term was the
‘reasonable expectations of the parties’ (on which see 
10.5
) rather than strict necessity,
and a term of this nature is now routinely implied into contracts in order to place a limit
upon the exercise of a contractual discretion (
Braganza
 
v. 
BP Shipping Ltd
 
[2015]
UKSC 17, [2015] 1 WLR 1661).
The second case is the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Crossley
 
v. 
Faithful & Gould
Holdings Ltd
 
[2004] EWCA Civ 293, [2004] 4 All ER 447. The issue before the court
was whether or not there was an ‘implied term of any contract of employment that the
employer will take reasonable care for the economic well-being of his employee’. In
answering this question Dyson LJ stated (at [36]):
It seems to me that, rather than focus on the elusive concept of necessity, it is better to recognise that, to some
extent at least, the existence and scope of standardised implied terms raise questions of reasonableness,
fairness and the balancing of competing policy considerations: see Peden (2001) 
LQR
 
459, 467–475.
Dyson LJ concluded, after a review of the authorities, that the implied term proposed on
behalf of the employee should be rejected. He relied on two principal considerations in
reaching this conclusion. First, after referring to 
Scally
, he stated that ‘it is not for this
court to take a big leap to introduce a major extension of the law in this area when only
comparatively recently the House of Lords declined to do so’. As we have noted earlier in
this section, the implied term recognized in 
Scally
 
was drawn in very narrow terms and
so it was thought to be inappropriate for the Court of Appeal now to imply a term cast in
much broader terms. Secondly, he concluded that such an implied term ‘would impose
an unfair and unreasonable burden on employers’. He continued:
It is one thing to say that, if an employer assumes the responsibility for giving financial advice to his employee,
he is under a duty to take reasonable care in giving that advice … It is quite a different matter to impose on an
employer the duty to give his employee financial advice in relation to benefits accruing from his employment, or
generally to safeguard the employee’s economic well-being.
Dyson LJ pointed out that the interests of employers and employees can and do conflict
and, in such cases, he stated that it would be ‘unreasonable’ to require the employer ‘to
have regard to the employee’s financial circumstances when he takes lawful business
decisions which may affect the employee’s economic welfare’. Further, it was held not to
be the function of an employer to ‘act as his employee’s financial adviser’ on the ground
that it ‘is simply not part of the bargain that is comprised in the contract of
employment’. This being the case, it was held that there were ‘no obvious policy reasons
to impose on an employer the general duty to protect his employee’s economic well-
being’. In this way the conclusion that no term should be implied into the contract of
employment obliging the employer to take reasonable care for the economic well-being
of an employee was based, not on the need for such a term, but on the appropriateness
of the term, having regard to the court’s perception of the nature of the relationship that
exists between an employer and an employee.
While the test applied by the courts in cases of terms implied in law may no longer be
based solely on necessity, it does not follow that the judges have a free hand to imply
terms into contracts when they see fit. They do not. As Lord Bingham MR observed in
Philips Electronique Grand Publique SA
 
v. 
British Sky Broadcasting Ltd
 
[1995] EMLR
472, 481, ‘it is because the implication of terms is so potentially intrusive that the law
imposes strict constraints on the exercise of this extraordinary power.’ In the case of
terms implied in fact the test is still based on necessity, and the courts will in general be
slow to imply a term into a contract, particularly where the parties have entered into a
lengthy and carefully drafted contract but have failed to make provision for a particular
issue. And, while the courts take a less stringent approach in the case of a term implied
in law, cases such as 
Scally
, 
Mahmud
, and 
Paragon Finance
 
demonstrate that the
threshold for the implication of a term remains a high one.

Conclusion
What is the justification for implying terms into a contract? This issue is considered in
the following two extracts. In the first extract Professor Collins considers a range of
possible justifications, while in the second extract Lord Steyn, writing extrajudicially,
surveys the different categories of implied terms. Interestingly, they reach a similar
conclusion, albeit by different routes, namely that the justification for implied terms is
to be found in the court’s view of the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties.
H COLLINS, 
THE LAW OF CONTRACT
(4th edn, Butterworths, 2003), pp. 245–246
How can we explain and justify the … use of implied terms to supplement
contractual obligations? In some instances it is apparent that the reference to the
joint intention of the parties, as evidenced by the need to give business efficacy to
their transaction, supports the implication of terms on grounds which merely
complement the traditional justification of contractual obligations based upon the
will of the parties. It is true that the will of the parties was never expressed, but the
evidence supporting the claim that the term represents a presupposition or
necessary implication of the words used can be so overwhelming that few could
doubt that the term represents their original intention. But it is clear that the use of
implied terms extends beyond any sort of justification of the type that the term
merely states expressly what was silently understood by the parties.
Economic analysis of law suggests a good reason why the courts should
provide a set of default rules to govern contractual relations in the absence of
express terms. Default rules save transaction costs by permitting the parties to
avoid the costs of negotiating every detail of their arrangement every time they
make a contract, because they know that the courts will fill in the gaps in the usual
way. This makes good sense, but it is arguable whether or not participants in the
market deliberately avail themselves of this opportunity to save transaction costs.
On the contrary, the proliferation of the standard form contract suggests that any
party with sufficient resources is likely to devise a standard set of express terms to
suit his or her purposes exactly. Many cases we have discussed so far concerning
implied terms, such as … 
Liverpool City Council
 
v. 
Irwin
, comprise instances where
the claim that an implied term exists is used to combat the one-sided standard
form contract of the other party.
Nor does the economic analysis suggest a satisfactory account of the grounds
for the selection of terms by the courts. Under the efficiency analysis, the court
should select those implied terms to which the parties would have agreed but for
the presence of transaction costs. Although this criterion makes sense for terms
which give a contract business efficacy, it is far from clear that it provides an
intelligible guide in other cases. Consider the bargaining situation in 
Liverpool City
Council
 
v. 
Irwin
. The council was presumably reluctant to agree to an obligation to
maintain the common premises, so it would have held out against such an
obligation, and, depending upon the local forces of supply and demand for tower
block local authority housing, it might or might not have been successful. But even
if it had agreed to the obligation, it could have insisted upon an increased rent to
cover those costs, so to imply a term requiring a maintenance obligation without
adjusting the rent produces a contract to which the parties never would have
agreed.
Further this economic analysis does not appear to correspond to the reasons
ventured by the courts for the selection of implied terms. What seems to be at the
heart of the model reasoning surrounding the implication of terms is the courts’
endeavour to structure contracts so that they incorporate a fair and practical
allocation of risks. The court imposed the duty to maintain the premises upon
Liverpool City Council almost certainly because this was the most practical and
efficient means of achieving the result. In the context of the employment
relationship, the recent introduction of implied terms which impose obligations
upon employers surely reflects changing views about the fair treatment of
employees and the risk of losing a job. Similarly, the duty imposed upon
professional sellers of goods to ensure that they are of satisfactory quality cannot
be justified as the term which would have been agreed in the absence of
transaction costs, for sellers would almost certainly seek to avoid such liability for
latent defects. The reason for this allocation of risk is surely that it fits both the
purpose of consumer protection and it places the risk of defects on the person in
the better position to avoid the advent of such risks occurring.
The notion of a default rule is therefore a misleading description of the use of
implied terms. Through the implication of terms the courts can achieve what they
regard as a fair and practical allocation of risks between the contracting parties, a
view which may alter over time as illustrated by the changing implied terms
inserted into the contract of employment. In this process the courts can seek to
equalise the obligations of the parties, even in the teeth of express terms of
standard form contracts, and so pursue ideas of fairness. The justification for
implied terms therefore rests ultimately not on the intentions of the parties but
rather the court’s view of the reasonable expectations of the parties to the
transaction.
LORD STEYN, ‘CONTRACT LAW: FULFILLING THE
REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS OF HONEST MEN’
(1997) 113 
LQR
 
433, 441–442
In our system … the implication of terms fulfils an important function in promoting
the reasonable expectations of parties. Three categories of implied terms can be
identified. First, there are terms implied by virtue of the usages of trade and
commerce. The assumption is that usages are taken for granted and therefore not
spelled out in writing. The recognition of trade usages protects the reasonable
expectations of the parties. Secondly, there are terms implied in fact … Such
implied terms fulfil the role of ad hoc gap fillers. Often the expectations of the
parties would be defeated if a term were not implied, e.g. sometimes a contract
simply will not work unless a particular duty to co-operate is implied. The law has
evolved practical tests for the permissibility of such an implication … The legal test
for the implication of a term is the standard of strict necessity. And it is right that it
should be so since courts ought not to supplement a contract by an implication
unless it is perfectly obvious that it is necessary to give effect to the reasonable
expectations of parties. It is, however, a myth to regard such an implied term as
based on an inference of the actual intention of the parties. The reasonable
expectations of the parties in an objective sense are controlling: they sometimes
demand that such terms be imputed to the parties. The third category is terms
implied by law. This occurs when incidents are impliedly annexed to particular
forms of contracts … Such implied terms operate as default rules. By and large
such implied terms have crystallised in statute or case law. But there is scope for
further development. In such new cases a broader approach than applied in the
case of terms implied in fact must necessarily prevail. The proposed implication
must fit the generality of cases. Indeed, despite some confusion in the authorities,
it is tolerably clear that the court may take into account considerations of
reasonableness in laying down the scope of terms to be implied in contracts of
common occurrence. This function of the court is essential in providing a
reasonable and fair framework for contracting. After all, there are many incidents of
contracts of common occurrence which the parties cannot always be expected to
reproduce in writing. This type of supplementation of contracts also fulfils an
essential function in promoting the reasonable expectations of the parties.

The Interpretation of Contracts
Central Issues
The principles applicable to the interpretation of contracts have been
restated by the House of Lords and the Supreme Court in recent years.
Three such restatements are the focus of this chapter. The first is to be
found in the judgment of Lord Hoffmann in 
Investors Compensation
Scheme Ltd
 
v. 
West Bromwich Building Society
, the second in the
judgment of Lord Neuberger in 
Arnold
 
v. 
Britton
, and the third in the
judgment of Lord Hodge in 
Wood
 
v. 
Capita Insurance Services Ltd
.
The significance of these principles should not be under-estimated.
Many contract cases that come before the courts raise issues of
interpretation.
In his speech in 
Investors Compensation Scheme
 
Lord Hoffmann
referred to the ‘fundamental change’ that has taken place in this area
of contract law, the outcome of which has been generally to assimilate
the way in which contractual documents are interpreted by judges to
the common-sense principles by which any serious utterance would
be interpreted in ordinary life.
Lord Hoffmann’s restatement aroused a degree of controversy,
principally because it was said to generate too much uncertainty and
on the ground that it threatened to add to the cost and complexity of
litigation. It was said to generate uncertainty because it appeared to
widen the circumstances in which judges could depart from the
‘natural and ordinary meaning’ of the words used by the parties. But in
Arnold
 
v. 
Britton
 
and 
Wood
 
v. 
Capita Insurance Services Ltd
 
the
judicial pendulum appears to have swung back in favour of certainty
and of giving to words their natural and ordinary meaning, at least in
the case of a contract of some sophistication which has been drafted
with the benefit of legal advice.
11.1
 
Introduction
The principles applied by the courts when interpreting contracts are of enormous
significance for contracting parties and their lawyers. This is so for a number of reasons.
The first is that a significant number of the disputes that come before the courts raise
issues of interpretation. The second is that many commercial parties make use of
standard terms of business (or use industry-wide standard forms), and the precise
meaning of these terms is a matter of considerable importance to them. The third is that
many lawyers spend a considerable amount of time drafting contracts, and the drafting
process must be carried out against the backdrop of the principles applied by the courts
to the interpretation of contracts. An example will illustrate the point. Suppose that a
client instructs a lawyer to draft an exclusion clause that will have the effect of excluding
the client’s liability for negligence in the course of the performance of any contract that
it concludes. Drafting such a clause is not a straightforward matter because the courts
have traditionally approached the interpretation of clauses which purport to exclude
liability in negligence in a restrictive fashion (see 
Canada Steamship Lines Ltd
 
v. 
The
King
 
[1952] AC 192, discussed in more detail at 
13.2.1
)). Although the 
Canada
Steamship
 
principles are now of diminishing significance, the safest approach to take
when drafting a contract term the aim of which is to exclude liability for a contracting
party’s own negligence is to draft the clause by reference to these principles. In the past
the courts have not shown much sympathy to a commercial party whose lawyer has not
complied with them. This view was classically expressed by Hobhouse J in 
EE Caledonia
Ltd
 
v. 
Orbit Valve Co Europe
 
[1993] 4 All ER 165, 173 when he said:
[I]t has to be borne in mind that commercial contracts are drafted by parties with access to legal advice and in
the context of established legal principles as reflected in the decisions of the courts. Principles of certainty, and
indeed justice, require that contracts be construed in accordance with the established principles. The parties are
always able by the choice of appropriate language to draft their contract so as to produce a different legal effect.
The choice is theirs.
11.2
 
The Evolution of the Law
Traditionally, the English courts adopted a literal approach to the interpretation of
contracts. In 
Lovell and Christmas Ltd
 
v. 
Wall
 
(1911) 104 LT 85 Cozens-Hardy MR
stated (at p. 88):
If there is one principle more clearly established than another in English law it is surely this: It is for the court
to construe a written document. It is irrelevant and improper to ask what the parties, prior to the execution of
the instrument, intended or understood. What is the meaning of the language that they have used therein? That
is the problem, and the only problem. In saying that, I do not mean to assert that no evidence can be admitted.
Indeed, the contrary is clear. If a deed relates to Black Acre, you may have evidence to show what are the
parcels. If a document is in a foreign language, you may have an interpreter. If it contains technical terms, an
expert may explain them. If, according to the custom of a trade or 
the usage of the market, a word has acquired
a secondary meaning, evidence may be given to prove it. A well-known instance is where in a particular trade
1000 rabbits meant 1200. But unless the case can be brought within some or one of these exceptions, it is the
duty of the court, which is presumed to understand the English language, to construe the document according
to the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words used therein, and without reference to anything which has
previously passed between the parties to it. When we come to the question of rectification,
 
wholly different
considerations apply. The essence of rectification is to bring the document which was expressed and intended to
be in pursuance of a prior agreement into harmony with that prior agreement.
The meaning of a document was therefore to be found within its four corners. This
approach was not without its merits. A court called upon to interpret a contract did not
have to listen to evidence about the commercial purpose of the clause or the
circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the contract. Its task was to rule on the
meaning of the words used by the parties and it could do that on the basis of the
documents alone. It was therefore possible for the parties to obtain a quick and
relatively inexpensive ruling on the meaning of a disputed term in a contract. However,
the drawbacks of this approach have been deemed to exceed its merits. In particular, it
was argued that it was unrealistic to engage in a process of interpretation that was
divorced from the context in which the parties found themselves. In other contexts, such
as the interpretation of statutes, there has been a shift from ‘a literalist to a purposive
approach’ to interpretation (see the dissenting speech of Lord Steyn in 
Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank
 
v. 
Burnhope
 
[1995] 1 WLR 1580, 1589) and this shift in emphasis
has penetrated into the interpretation of contractual documents.
1
In retrospect the turning point can be seen to be the decision of the House of Lords in
Prenn
 
v. 
Simmonds
 
[1971] 1 WLR 1381. The dispute between the parties related to the
meaning of the word ‘profit’ in an agreement concluded under seal on 6 July 1960. Lord
Wilberforce, giving the only reasoned judgment in the House of Lords, stated (at pp.
1383–1384):
In order for the agreement of July 6, 1960, to be understood, it must be placed in its context. The time has long
passed when agreements, even those under seal, were isolated from the matrix of facts in which they were set
and interpreted purely on internal linguistic considerations. There is no need to appeal here to any modern,
anti-literalist tendencies, for Lord Blackburn’s well-known judgment in 
River Wear Commissioners
 
v.
Adamson
 
(1877) 2 App Cas 743, 763 provides ample warrant for a liberal approach. We must, as he said, inquire
beyond the language and see what the circumstances were with reference to which the words were used, and the
object, appearing from those circumstances, which the person using them had in view. Moreover, at any rate
since 1859 (
Macdonald
 
v. 
Longbottom
 
1 E & E 977) it has been clear enough that evidence of mutually known
facts may be admitted to identify the meaning of a descriptive term.
The change in emphasis is clearly discernible. Contract documents are no longer to be
interpreted ‘purely’ on internal linguistic considerations. Rather, they are to be placed in
their ‘context’. In other words, the court must have regard to the wider circumstances
surrounding the conclusion of the contract. Lord Wilberforce returned to the issue in
Reardon Smith Line Ltd
 
v. 
Yngvar Hansen-Tangen
 
[1976] 1 WLR 989, 995–997 when
he said:
No contracts are made in a vacuum: there is always a setting in which they have to be placed. The nature of
what is legitimate to have regard to is usually described as ‘the surrounding circumstances’ but this phrase is
imprecise: it can be illustrated but hardly defined. In a commercial contract it is certainly right that the court
should know the commercial purpose of the contract and this in turn presupposes knowledge of the genesis of
the transaction, the background, the context, the market in which the parties are operating …
It is often said that, in order to be admissible in aid of construction, these extrinsic facts must be within the
knowledge of both parties to the contract, but this requirement should not be stated in too narrow a sense.
When one speaks of the intention of the parties to the contract, one is speaking objectively—the parties cannot
themselves give direct evidence of what their intention was—and what must be ascertained is what is to be
taken as the intention which reasonable people would have had if placed in the situation of the parties. Similarly
when one is speaking of aim, or object, or commercial purpose, one is speaking objectively of what reasonable
persons would have in mind in the situation of the parties … [w]hat the court must do must be to place itself in
thought in the same factual matrix as that in which the parties were.
 
Rectification is discussed in more detail at 
16.7
. Rectification only comes into play once the meaning of the words
1
used by the parties has been ascertained (for further consideration of the relationship between rectification and
interpretation see A Burrows, ‘Construction and Rectification’ in A Burrows and E Peel (eds), 
Contract Terms
 
(Oxford
University Press, 2007) p. 77). A contract can be rectified if there has been a defect in the recording of the contract so
that the written agreement does not reflect the agreement which the parties intended to make. On the other hand, if
the agreement does give effect to the intention of the parties, there is nothing for the court to rectify.
11.3
 
Restatements of the Applicable
Principles
The shift from a narrow, literal approach to the interpretation of contracts, evident in
the speeches of Lord Wilberforce in 
Prenn
 
and 
Reardon Smith
, led in time to the speech
of Lord Hoffmann in 
Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd
 
v. 
West Bromwich Building
Society
 
[1998] 1 WLR 896, in which he sought to restate the principles according to
which contractual documents are to be interpreted. But Lord Hoffmann’s restatement
was not to be the last attempt at setting out the general principles to be applied by the
courts when seeking to interpret a contract. In recent years the Supreme Court has had a
regular flow of cases raising issues of contractual interpretation, and in two of these
cases, 
Arnold
 
v. 
Britton
 
[2015] UKSC 36, [2015] AC 1619 and 
Wood
 
v. 
Capita Insurance
Services Ltd
 
[2017] UKSC 24, [2017] AC 1173, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge
respectively sought to draw together the various threads and restate the principles which
ought to guide the courts when seeking to interpret a contract. We shall examine the
three judgments in turn before seeking to evaluate the approach which the courts
currently take towards the interpretation of contracts.
INVESTORS COMPENSATION SCHEME LTD V. WEST
BROMWICH BUILDING SOCIETY
[1998] 1 WLR 896, House of Lords
Lord Hoffmann
My Lords … I should preface my explanation of my reasons with some general
remarks about the principles by which contractual documents are nowadays
construed. 
I do not think that the fundamental change which has overtaken this
branch of the law, particularly as a result of the speeches of Lord Wilberforce in
Prenn
 
v. 
Simmonds
, [1971] 1 WLR 1381 at 1384–1386 and 
Reardon Smith Line
Ltd
 
v. 
Hansen-Tangen, Hansen-Tangen
 
v. 
Sanko Steamship Co
 
[1976] 1 WLR 989,
is always sufficiently appreciated. The result has been, subject to one important
exception, to assimilate the way in which such documents are interpreted by
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
judges to the common sense principles by which any serious utterance would be
interpreted in ordinary life. Almost all the old intellectual baggage of ‘legal’
interpretation has been discarded. The principles may be summarised as follows:
Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document
would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge
which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation
in which they were at the time of the contract.
The background was famously referred to by Lord Wilberforce as the
‘matrix of fact’, but this phrase is, if anything, an understated description of
what the background may include. Subject to the requirement that it should
have been reasonably available to the parties and to the exception to be
mentioned next, it includes absolutely anything which would have affected
the way in which the language of the document would have been
understood by a reasonable man.
The law excludes from the admissible background the previous
negotiations of the parties and their declarations of subjective intent. They
are admissible only in an action for rectification. The law makes this
distinction for reasons of practical policy and, in this respect only, legal
interpretation differs from the way we would interpret utterances in ordinary
life. The boundaries of this exception are in some respects unclear. But this
is not the occasion on which to explore them.
The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a
reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words. The
meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of
the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant
background would reasonably have been understood to mean. The
background may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between
the possible meanings of words which are ambiguous but even (as
occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for
whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax (see 
Mannai
Investment Co Ltd
 
v. 
Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd
 
[1997] 2 WLR 945).
The ‘rule’ that words should be given their ‘natural and ordinary meaning’
reflects the commonsense proposition that we do not easily accept that
people have made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents. On
the other hand, if one would nevertheless conclude from the background
that something must have gone wrong with the language, the law does not
require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which they plainly
could not have had. Lord Diplock made this point more vigorously when he
said in 
Antaios Cia Naviera SA
 
v. 
Salen Rederierna AB, The Antaios
 
[1985]
AC 191 at 201:
‘ … if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is going to lead to a
conclusion that flouts business common sense, it must be made to yield to business common sense.’
ARNOLD V. BRITTON
[2015] UKSC 36, [2015] AC 1619
Lord Neuberger
Interpretation of contractual provisions
14. Over the past 45 years, the House of Lords and Supreme Court have
discussed the correct approach to be adopted to the interpretation, or construction,
of contracts in a number of cases starting with 
Prenn
 
v. 
Simmonds
 
[1971] 1 WLR
1381 and culminating in 
Rainy Sky SA
 
v. 
Kookmin Bank
 
[2011] UKSC 50, [2011] 1
WLR 2900.
15.
 
When interpreting a written contract, the court is concerned to identify the
intention of the parties by reference to ‘what a reasonable person having all the
background knowledge which would have been available to the parties would have
understood them to be using the language in the contract to mean’, to quote Lord
Hoffmann in 
Chartbrook Ltd
 
v. 
Persimmon Homes Ltd
 
[2009] UKHL 38, [2009] 1
AC 1101, para 14. And it does so by focussing on the meaning of the relevant
words … in their documentary, factual and commercial context. That meaning has
to be assessed in the light of (i) the natural and ordinary meaning of the clause, (ii)
any other relevant provisions of the lease, (iii) the overall purpose of the clause
and the lease, (iv) the facts and circumstances known or assumed by the parties at
the time that the document was executed, and (v) commercial common sense, but
(vi) disregarding subjective evidence of any party’s intentions. In this connection,
see 
Prenn
 
at pp 1384–1386 and 
Reardon Smith Line Ltd
 
v. 
Yngvar Hansen-
Tangen (trading as HE Hansen-Tangen)
 
[1976] 1 WLR 989, 995–997 per Lord
Wilberforce, 
Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (in liquidation)
 
v. 
Ali
[2002] 1 AC 251, para 8, per Lord Bingham, and the survey of more recent
authorities in 
Rainy Sky
, per Lord Clarke at paras 21–30.
16.
 
For present purposes, I think it is important to emphasise seven factors.
17.
 
First, the reliance placed in some cases on commercial common sense
and surrounding circumstances … should not be invoked to undervalue the
importance of the language of the provision which is to be construed. The exercise
of interpreting a provision involves identifying what the parties meant through the
eyes of a reasonable reader, and, save perhaps in a very unusual case, that
meaning is most obviously to be gleaned from the language of the provision.
Unlike commercial common sense and the surrounding circumstances, the parties
have control over the language they use in a contract. And, again save perhaps in
a very unusual case, the parties must have been specifically focussing on the
issue covered by the provision when agreeing the wording of that provision.
18.
 
Secondly, when it comes to considering the centrally relevant words to be
interpreted, I accept that the less clear they are, or, to put it another way, the worse
their drafting, the more ready the court can properly be to depart from their natural
meaning. That is simply the obverse of the sensible proposition that the clearer the
natural meaning the more difficult it is to justify departing from it. However, that
does not justify the court embarking on an exercise of searching for, let alone
constructing, drafting infelicities in order to facilitate a departure from the natural
meaning. If there is a specific error in the drafting, it may often have no relevance
to the issue of interpretation which the court has to resolve.
19.
 
The third point I should mention is that commercial common sense is not to
be invoked retrospectively. The mere fact that a contractual arrangement, if
interpreted according to its natural language, has worked out badly, or even
disastrously, for one of the parties is not a reason for departing from the natural
language. Commercial common sense is only relevant to the extent of how matters
would or could have been perceived by the parties, or by reasonable people in the
position of the parties, as at the date that the contract was made. Judicial
observations 
such as those of … Lord Diplock in 
Antaios Cia Naviera SA
 
v. 
Salen
Rederierna AB (The Antaios)
 
[1985] AC 191, 201 … have to be read and applied
bearing that important point in mind.
20.
 
Fourthly, while commercial common sense is a very important factor to
take into account when interpreting a contract, a court should be very slow to reject
the natural meaning of a provision as correct simply because it appears to be a
very imprudent term for one of the parties to have agreed, even ignoring the
benefit of wisdom of hindsight. The purpose of interpretation is to identify what the
parties have agreed, not what the court thinks that they should have agreed.
Experience shows that it is by no means unknown for people to enter into
arrangements which are ill-advised, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of
hindsight, and it is not the function of a court when interpreting an agreement to
relieve a party from the consequences of his imprudence or poor advice.
Accordingly, when interpreting a contract a judge should avoid re-writing it in an
attempt to assist an unwise party or to penalise an astute party.
21.
 
The fifth point concerns the facts known to the parties. When interpreting a
contractual provision, one can only take into account facts or circumstances which
existed at the time that the contract was made, and which were known or
reasonably available to both parties. Given that a contract is a bilateral, or
synallagmatic, arrangement involving both parties, it cannot be right, when
interpreting a contractual provision, to take into account a fact or circumstance
known only to one of the parties.
22.
 
Sixthly, in some cases, an event subsequently occurs which was plainly
not intended or contemplated by the parties, judging from the language of their
contract. In such a case, if it is clear what the parties would have intended, the
court will give effect to that intention. An example of such a case is 
Aberdeen City
Council
 
v. 
Stewart Milne Group Ltd
 
[2011] UKSC 56, 2012 SCLR 114, where the
court concluded that ‘any … approach’ other than that which was adopted ‘would
defeat the parties’ clear objectives’, but the conclusion was based on what the
parties ‘had in mind when they entered into’ the contract (see paras 17 and 22).
23.
 
Seventhly [and a point which was of particular relevance to the facts of the
case before the Supreme Court], reference was made in argument to service
charge clauses being construed ‘restrictively’. I am unconvinced by the notion that
service charge clauses are to be subject to any special rule of interpretation. Even
if (which it is unnecessary to decide) a landlord may have simpler remedies than a
tenant to enforce service charge provisions, that is not relevant to the issue of how
one interprets the contractual machinery for assessing the tenant’s contribution.
The origin of the adverb was in a judgment of Rix LJ in 
McHale
 
v. 
Earl Cadogan
[2010] EWCA Civ 14, [2010] 1 EGLR 51, para 17. What he was saying, quite
correctly, was that the court should not ‘bring within the general words of a service
charge clause anything which does not clearly belong there’. However, that does
not help resolve the sort of issue of interpretation raised in this case.
WOOD V. CAPITA INSURANCE SERVICES LTD
[2017] UKSC 24, [2017] AC 1173
Lord Hodge
10. The court’s task is to ascertain the objective meaning of the language which
the parties have chosen to express their agreement. It has long been accepted
that this is not a literalist exercise focused solely on a parsing of the wording of the
particular clause but that 
the court must consider the contract as a whole and,
depending on the nature, formality and quality of drafting of the contract, give more
or less weight to elements of the wider context in reaching its view as to that
objective meaning. In 
Prenn
 
v. 
Simmonds
 
[1971] 1 WLR 1381 (1383H–1385D) and
in 
Reardon Smith Line Ltd
 
v. 
Yngvar Hansen-Tangen
 
[1976] 1 WLR 989 (997),
Lord Wilberforce affirmed the potential relevance to the task of interpreting the
parties’ contract of the factual background known to the parties at or before the
date of the contract, excluding evidence of the prior negotiations. When in his
celebrated judgment in 
Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd
 
v. 
West Bromwich
Building Society
 
[1998] 1 WLR 896 Lord Hoffmann (pp 912–913) reformulated the
principles of contractual interpretation, some saw his second principle, which
allowed consideration of the whole relevant factual background available to the
parties at the time of the contract, as signalling a break with the past. But Lord
Bingham in an extra-judicial writing, 
A new thing under the sun? The interpretation
of contracts and the ICS decision
 
Edin LR Vol 12, 374–390, persuasively
demonstrated that the idea of the court putting itself in the shoes of the contracting
parties had a long pedigree.
11.
 
Lord Clarke elegantly summarised the approach to construction in 
Rainy
Sky
 
at para 21f. In 
Arnold
 
all of the judgments confirmed the approach in 
Rainy
Sky
 
(Lord Neuberger paras 13–14; Lord Hodge para 76; and Lord Carnwath para
108). Interpretation is, as Lord Clarke stated in 
Rainy Sky
 
(para 21), a unitary
exercise; where there are rival meanings, the court can give weight to the
implications of rival constructions by reaching a view as to which construction is
more consistent with business common sense. But, in striking a balance between
the indications given by the language and the implications of the competing
constructions the court must consider the quality of drafting of the clause (
Rainy
Sky
 
para 26, citing Mance LJ in 
Gan Insurance Co Ltd
 
v. 
Tai Ping Insurance Co Ltd
(No 2)
 
[2001] 2 All ER (Comm) 299 paras 13 and 16); and it must also be alive to
the possibility that one side may have agreed to something which with hindsight
did not serve his interest: 
Arnold
 
(paras 20 and 77). Similarly, the court must not
lose sight of the possibility that a provision may be a negotiated compromise or
that the negotiators were not able to agree more precise terms.
12.
 
This unitary exercise involves an iterative process by which each
suggested interpretation is checked against the provisions of the contract and its
commercial consequences are investigated: 
Arnold
 
para 77 citing 
In re Sigma
Finance Corpn
 
[2010] 1 All ER 571, para 10 per Lord Mance. To my mind once one
has read the language in dispute and the relevant parts of the contract that provide
its context, it does not matter whether the more detailed analysis commences with
the factual background and the implications of rival constructions or a close
examination of the relevant language in the contract, so long as the court balances
the indications given by each.
13.
 
Textualism and contextualism are not conflicting paradigms in a battle for
exclusive occupation of the field of contractual interpretation. Rather, the lawyer
and the judge, when interpreting any contract, can use them as tools to ascertain
the objective meaning of the language which the parties have chosen to express
their agreement. The extent to which each tool will assist the court in its task will
vary according to the circumstances of the particular agreement or agreements.
Some agreements may be successfully interpreted principally by textual analysis,
for example because of their sophistication and complexity and because they have
been negotiated and prepared with the assistance of skilled professionals. The
correct interpretation of other contracts may be achieved by a greater emphasis on
the factual matrix, for example because of their informality, brevity or the absence
of skilled professional assistance. But negotiators of complex formal contracts may
often not achieve a logical and coherent text because of, for example, the
conflicting aims of the parties, failures of communication, differing 
drafting
practices, or deadlines which require the parties to compromise in order to reach
agreement. There may often therefore be provisions in a detailed professionally
drawn contract which lack clarity and the lawyer or judge in interpreting such
provisions may be particularly helped by considering the factual matrix and the
purpose of similar provisions in contracts of the same type. The iterative process,
of which Lord Mance spoke in 
Sigma Finance Corpn
 
(above), assists the lawyer or
judge to ascertain the objective meaning of disputed provisions.
14.
 
On the approach to contractual interpretation, 
Rainy Sky
 
and 
Arnold
 
were
saying the same thing.
15.
 
The recent history of the common law of contractual interpretation is one of
continuity rather than change. One of the attractions of English law as a legal
system of choice in commercial matters is its stability and continuity, particularly in
contractual interpretation.
11.4
 
The Scope of the Applicable Principles
These statements, or restatements, merit careful evaluation. They give rise to a number
of issues to which we must now turn our attention.
11.4.1
 
The Importance of Principles
The judgments set out earlier attempt to distil the principles which the courts apply to
the interpretation of contracts. They are not rules to be rigidly applied. Rather, they are
principles to guide the court and they do so at a rather high level of generality. It is not
uncommon for parties to litigation to be in agreement on the principles to be applied by
the courts to the interpretation of the contract in dispute but to disagree on the
application of these principles to the facts of the individual case (see, for example,
Britvic plc
 
v. 
Britvic Pensions Ltd
 
[2021] EWCA Civ 867, [16] and 
Primus International
Holding Co
 
v
. Triumph Controls—UK Ltd
 
[2020] EWCA Civ 1228, [2021] 1 BCLC 697,
[22]). At this point it is important to note that the precedent value of a case concerned
with the interpretation of a contract is generally low. Thus in 
Surrey Heath Borough
Council
 
v. 
Lovell Construction Ltd
 
(1990) 48 Build LR 113 Dillon LJ stated (at p. 118)
that ‘a decision on a different clause in a different context is seldom of much help on a
question of construction’. Further, in 
Midland Bank plc
 
v. 
Cox McQueen
 
[1999] 1 FLR
1002 Mummery LJ stated (at p. 1012):
Detailed comparisons of one document with another and of one precedent with another do not usually help the
court to reach a decision on construction. Indeed, that exercise occupies a disproportionate amount of valuable
time which would be better spent on the arguments that really count: those which focus on the precise terms of
the relevant documents and the illuminating environment of the transaction.
The authorities are, however, of greater importance in the situation where parties have
chosen to use words that have acquired an established technical meaning. In such a case
the courts are likely to give the words the meaning that they have been given in the case-
law (
British Sugar plc
 
v. 
NEI Power Projects Ltd
 
(1997) 87 BLR 42, 50).
11.4.2
 
The Objective Nature of the Test
Lord Hoffmann’s statement that interpretation ‘is the ascertainment of the meaning
which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background
knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in
which they were at the time of the contract’ is, or appears to be, relatively
uncontroversial and it is also adopted by Lord Neuberger (at [15]) and Lord Hodge (at
[10]). It emphasizes the objective nature of the test applied by the courts. The
‘methodology’ of the common law is ‘not to probe the real intentions of the parties but to
ascertain the contextual meaning of the relevant contractual language. Intention is
determined by reference to expressed rather than actual intention’ (per Lord Steyn in
Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank
 
v. 
Burnhope
 
[1995] 1 WLR 1580, 1587). Statements of
subjective intent are therefore inadmissible so that where witnesses express views as to
what they thought the provisions meant or were intended to mean, such evidence, being
subjective in nature, is inadmissible (
BP Gas Marketing Ltd
 
v. 
La Société Sonatrach
[2016] EWHC 2461 (Comm), [37]).
11.4.3
 
The ‘Factual Matrix’
The use of the language of ‘matrix of fact’ can be traced back to the speech of Lord
Wilberforce in 
Prenn
 
v. 
Simmonds
 
[1971] 1 WLR 1381. However, its use has been
attacked, in particular by Sir Christopher Staughton, a former judge in the Court of
Appeal (see ‘How Do the Courts Interpret Commercial Contracts?’ [1999] 
CLJ
 
303,
306–308). He criticized the use of language such as ‘the matrix of fact’ on the ground
that ‘counsel have wildly different ideas as to what a matrix is and what it includes’.
Particularly difficult was the use by Lord Hoffmann in his second principle in 
Investors
Compensation Scheme
 
of the words ‘absolutely anything’ which appeared to encourage
lawyers to trawl through all the documentation relating to the transaction and then seek
to introduce it all in evidence as part of the ‘matrix of fact’. Lord Hoffmann sought to
meet this criticism in 
Bank of Credit and Commerce International
 
v. 
Ali
 
[2001] UKHL
8, [2002] 1 AC 251 when he stated (at [39]):
I did not think it necessary to emphasise that I meant anything which a reasonable man would have regarded as
relevant
. I was merely saying that there is no conceptual limit to what can be regarded as background. It is not,
for example, confined to the factual background but can include the state of the law (as in cases in which one
takes into account that the parties are unlikely to have intended to agree to something unlawful or legally
ineffective) or proved common assumptions which were in fact quite mistaken … I was certainly not
encouraging a trawl through ‘background’ which could not have made a reasonable person think that the parties
must have departed from conventional usage.
This qualification is, however, limited in its scope. It does not purport to fix a formal
limit to the scope of the ‘factual matrix’. That said, the significance of the factual matrix
does vary from case to case. In particular, it is likely to play a lesser role in the case
where the issue before the court is the interpretation of a document which is in standard
use throughout a particular industry (
Re Sigma Finance Corp (in administrative
receivership)
 
[2009] UKSC 2, [2010] 1 All ER 571) or the interpretation of a public
document, such as a charge registered in the land registry, which is available for
inspection (
Cherry Tree Investments Ltd
 
v. 
Landmain Ltd
 
[2012] EWCA Civ 736,
[2013] Ch 305).
There is little evidence that judges have experienced difficulty in ascertaining what does
and what does not fall within the ‘matrix of fact’ or in restraining the excesses of
counsel. The point was well put by Arden LJ in 
Static Control Components (Europe) Ltd
v. 
Egan
 
[2004] EWCA Civ 392, [2004] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 429 when she stated:
When the principles in the 
ICS
 
case were first enunciated, there were fears that the courts would on simple
questions of the construction of deeds and documents be inundated with background material. Lord Hoffmann
recognised this risk by emphasising in 
BCCI
 
v. 
Ali
 
[2002] 1 AC 251 at 269 that his reference to ‘absolutely
anything’ in his second proposition was to anything that a reasonable man would have regarded as relevant.
Speaking for myself, I am not aware that the fears expressed as to the opening of floodgates have been realised.
The powers of case management in the Civil Procedure Rules could obviously be used to keep evidence within
its proper bounds. The important point is that the principles in the 
ICS
 
case lead to a more principled and fairer
result by focusing on the meaning which the relevant background objectively assessed indicates that the parties
intended.
To the extent that uncertainty persists it would appear to relate to the weight to be given
to the evidence once it has been admitted rather than to the decision whether to admit
the evidence or not.
11.4.4
 
The Exclusionary Rules
Lord Hoffmann’s third principle in 
Investors Compensation Scheme
 
is his exception to
the rule that documents are to be interpreted in accordance with the common-sense
principles by which any serious utterance would be interpreted in ordinary life. It is a
principle that declares certain types of evidence to be inadmissible. In so far as it states
that ‘declarations of subjective intent’ are inadmissible, it has not given rise to debate.
The first principle establishes that the test to be applied by the court is an objective one
and so the exclusion of statements of subjective intent does not occasion surprise. More
difficult is the exclusion of ‘previous negotiations’. In 
Investors Compensation Scheme
Lord Hoffmann acknowledged that the boundaries of this exclusion are ‘in some
respects unclear’ and it was not until the decision of the House of Lords in 
Chartbrook
Ltd
 
v. 
Persimmon Homes Ltd
 
[2009] UKHL 38, [2009] 1 AC 1101 that the issue was
resolved.
In 
Chartbrook
 
the House of Lords affirmed the existence of this general exclusionary
rule. In declining to depart from the general rule, their Lordships attached importance
to the need to uphold the value of certainty in the interpretation of contracts and to the
imperative not to increase the costs of litigation by increasing still further the range of
admissible evidence. As Lord Hoffmann observed (at [37]), the law of contract is
‘designed to enforce promises with a high degree of predictability’ and ‘the more one
allows conventional meanings or syntax to be displaced by inferences drawn from
background, the less predictable the outcome is likely to be’. Lord Hoffmann summed
up the reasoning of their Lordships in the following passage (at [41]):
The conclusion I would reach is that there is no clearly established case for departing from the exclusionary
rule. The rule may well mean … that parties are sometimes held bound by a contract in terms which, upon a full
investigation of the course of negotiations, 
a reasonable observer would not have taken them to have intended.
But a system which sometimes allows this to happen may be justified in the more general interest of economy
and predictability in obtaining advice and adjudicating disputes. It is, after all, usually possible to avoid
surprises by carefully reading the documents before signing them and there are the safety nets of rectification
and estoppel by convention. Your Lordships do not have the material on which to form a view. It is possible that
empirical study (for example, by the Law Commission) may show that the alleged disadvantages of admissibility
are not in practice very significant or that they are outweighed by the advantages of doing more precise justice
in exceptional cases or falling into line with international conventions. But the determination of where the
balance of advantage lies is not in my opinion suitable for judicial decision.
It is, however, important to observe the scope of the rule which excludes evidence of
pre-contractual negotiations. As Lord Hoffmann observed (at [47]):
There are two legitimate safety devices which will in most cases prevent the exclusionary rule from causing
injustice. But they have to be specifically pleaded and clearly established. One is rectification. The other is
estoppel by convention … If the parties have negotiated an agreement upon some common assumption, which
may include an assumption that certain words will bear a certain meaning, they may be estopped from
contending that the words should be given a different meaning. Both of these remedies lie outside the
exclusionary rule, since they start from the premise that, as a matter of construction, the agreement does not
have the meaning for which the party seeking rectification or raising an estoppel contends.
Lord Hoffmann’s confidence in the ability of these ‘safety devices’ to prevent injustice
may be questioned. Both rectification (see 
16.7
) and estoppel by convention (see 
5.3.4
)
operate within narrow confines and so may provide little solace for the party seeking to
rely on them in a particular case. More comfort may be found in a broader exception
subsequently recognized by the Supreme Court, namely that pre-contractual
negotiations which are ‘part of the factual matrix’ may be admissible in evidence
(
Oceanbulk Shipping and Trading SA
 
v. 
TMT Asia Ltd
 
[2010] UKSC 44, [2011] 1 AC
662, [40]), although the ‘facts’ admissible in evidence are confined to those known to
both parties and do not extend to ‘a mere negotiating position taken by one of the
parties’ (
Northrop Grumman Missions Systems Europe Ltd
 
v. 
BAE Systems (Al Diriyah
C41) Ltd
 
[2015] EWCA Civ 844, [2015] BLR 657, [31]). The Court of Appeal in 
Merthyr
(South Wales) Ltd
 
v. 
Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council
 
[2019] EWCA Civ 526
recognized that it may not always be easy to distinguish between the case where
previous negotiations are legitimately relied upon to identify the ‘genesis and aim of the
transaction’ and the case where they are impermissibly relied upon for the purpose of
showing what the parties intended a particular provision in a contract to mean
(although on the facts of the case the Court of Appeal had no difficulty in concluding
that the pre-contractual negotiations were not admissible because they were being relied
upon to support the submission that a clause of the agreement should be interpreted in
a particular way). The likelihood is that the decision in 
Chartbrook
 
will give rise to the
occasional injustice but, in the view of their Lordships, that injustice is outweighed by
the certainty and predictability which the maintenance of the general exclusionary rule
will provide (see also 
Scottish Widows Fund and Life Assurance Society
 
v. 
BGC
International
 
[2012] EWCA Civ 607, (2012) 142 Con LR 27, [34]–[35] and [70]).
Lord Hoffmann made no express reference in his speech in 
Investors Compensation
Scheme
 
to the admissibility of evidence of conduct subsequent to the making of the
contract. Pre-
Investors Compensation Scheme
 
authority establishes that such evidence
is inadmissible (
Schuler AG
 
v. 
Wickman Machine Tool Sales
 
[1974] AC 235), although it
may be relevant to a plea of estoppel, including estoppel by convention (
James Miller &
Partners Ltd
 
v. 
Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd
 
[1970] AC 583; 
Mannai
Investment Co Ltd
 
v. 
Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd
 
[1997] AC 749, 768 (Lord Steyn)
and 779 (Lord Hoffmann)), to the question whether a contract has been subsequently
varied (
Philip Collins Ltd
 
v. 
Davis
 
[2000] 3 All ER 808, 822) and it does not apply to
oral contracts (
Maggs (t/a BM Builders)
 
v. 
Marsh
 
[2006] EWCA Civ 1058, [2006] BLR
395). The reason given for the exclusion of this evidence is that, were it admissible, the
contract could mean one thing on the day on which it was signed but mean something
completely different six weeks later by virtue of the subsequent conduct of the parties.
This exclusionary rule has been affirmed in a number of cases post-
Investors
Compensation Scheme
 
(see, for example, 
The ‘Tychy’ (No 2)
 
[2001] EWCA Civ 1198,
[2001] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 403, [33]) but has been departed from in New Zealand (see
Wholesale Distributors Ltd
 
v. 
Gibbons Holdings Ltd
 
[2007] NZSC 37, [2008] 1 NZLR
277, noted by Berg (2008) 124 
LQR
 
6).
11.4.5
 
The Iterative Nature of the Process
In his judgment in 
Wood
 
v. 
Capita Insurance Services Ltd
 
Lord Hodge referred (at [12])
to the ‘iterative’ nature of the process by which each suggested interpretation is checked
against the provisions of the contract and its commercial consequences are investigated.
In this way the process of interpretation requires both a textual analysis of the language
used against the background of facts reasonably available to the parties and
consideration of the commercial consequences of the rival interpretations. A helpful
indication of the range of materials to which the courts will have regard when carrying
out this iterative process is provided in the judgment of Lord Neuberger in 
Arnold
 
v.
Britton
 
(at [15]). It can be seen that the effect of the approach is gradually to expand the
range of materials to be taken into account. Lord Neuberger commences with the
natural and ordinary meaning of the clause that is in dispute. This is a good place to
start but it is important to state that this is the beginning and not the end of the inquiry.
Then, secondly, he states that the court will have regard to any other relevant provisions
of the contract. This is an important point. It is important to set the clause in dispute in
the context of the contract as a whole and, when that exercise is conducted, it may be
that the prima facie meaning of the disputed clause has to give way to an alternative
possible meaning so that the disputed clause can then be reconciled with the other
provisions of the contract. This is the essence of the iterative process. Beyond the
express terms of the contract, Lord Neuberger states that the court should have regard
to the overall purpose of the disputed clause, the facts and circumstances known or
assumed by the parties at the time of entry into the contract, and commercial common
sense.
The range of materials to which the courts can have regard can be identified with some
precision. Much more difficult is the weight to be given to these factors. The courts have
been less clear on this issue. It is suggested that much depends upon the clarity which is
obtained by examining the words of the disputed clause in the context of the contract as
a whole. Where the meaning of the disputed clause is clear and that meaning fits within
the structure of the contract as a whole, the wider circumstances surrounding the
contract and considerations of commercial common sense are unlikely to persuade a
court to depart 
from the clear meaning of the term in dispute (see, for example, 
Mutual
Energy Ltd
 
v. 
Starr Underwriting Agents Ltd
 
[2016] EWHC 590 (TCC), [2016] BLR
312). But, where the meaning of the disputed term is not clear, then the court is much
more likely to have regard to, and attach weight to, the surrounding circumstances and
considerations of common sense when seeking to decide which of the possible
competing meanings is the correct one.
11.4.6
 
Something Has Gone Wrong with the
Language
What are the courts to do when it is alleged that something has gone wrong in the
drafting process and it is submitted by one of the parties that the natural and ordinary
meaning of the disputed term does not give effect to the intention of the parties? Lord
Hoffmann addressed this issue in his fifth principle in 
Investors Compensation Scheme
where he referred to the case where ‘something must have gone wrong with the
language’. In such a case he stated that the law ‘does not require the judges to attribute
to the parties an intention which they plainly could not have had’. There is, however, an
initial hurdle that must be overcome by a party who wishes to submit that something
has ‘gone wrong with the language’. That hurdle is that the courts ‘do not easily accept
that people have made linguistic mistakes’.
The importance of this hurdle was affirmed by the House of Lords in 
Chartbrook Ltd
 
v.
Persimmon Homes Ltd
 
[2009] UKHL 38, [2009] 1 AC 1101, where Lord Hoffmann
acknowledged (at [15]) that it ‘requires a strong case to persuade the court that
something must have gone wrong with the language’. In order to establish such a ‘strong
case’ it is necessary to do more than demonstrate that a particular interpretation results
in an outcome which is especially favourable to one party. As Lord Hoffmann observed
(at [20]):
It is of course true that the fact that a contract may appear to be unduly favourable to one of the parties is not a
sufficient reason for supposing that it does not mean what it says. The reasonable addressee of the instrument
has not been privy to the negotiations and cannot tell whether a provision favourable to one side was not in
exchange for some concession elsewhere or simply a bad bargain. But the striking feature of this case is not
merely that the provisions as interpreted by the judge and the Court of Appeal are favourable to Chartbrook. It
is that they make the structure and language of the various provisions of Schedule 6 appear arbitrary and
irrational, when it is possible for the concepts employed by the parties … to be combined in a rational way.
Thus there comes a point (which is not easy to define) where the results are so startling
that the court will conclude that the contract does not mean what it says and it will then
look to adopt a construction of the contract which gives effect to the intention of the
parties.
Once this point has been reached, the court’s powers to adapt the language of the
contract in order to give effect to the intention of the parties would seem to be broad.
Lord Hoffmann in 
Chartbrook
 
summarized these powers as follows (at [21]):
I do not think that it is necessary to undertake the exercise of comparing this language with that of the
definition in order to see how much use of red ink is involved. When the language used in an instrument gives
rise to difficulties of construction, the process of interpretation does not require one to formulate some
alternative form of words which approximates as closely as possible to that of the parties. It is to decide what a
reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant by using the language which they did. The
fact that the 
court might have to express that meaning in language quite different from that used by the parties
(‘12th January’ instead of ‘13th January’ in 
Mannai Investment Co Ltd
 
v. 
Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd
[1997] AC 749; ‘any claim sounding in rescission (whether for undue influence or otherwise)’ instead of ‘any
claim (whether sounding in rescission for undue influence or otherwise)’ in 
Investors Compensation Scheme
Ltd
 
v. 
West Bromwich Building Society
) … is no reason for not giving effect to what they appear to have meant.
He continued (at [25]):
What is clear … is that there is not, so to speak, a limit to the amount of red ink or verbal rearrangement or
correction which the court is allowed. All that is required is that it should be clear that something has gone
wrong with the language and that it should be clear what a reasonable person would have understood the
parties to have meant.
The importance of these statements lies in their willingness to engage in a measure of
rewriting of the contract under the guise of interpretation (a process described as
‘corrective interpretation’ by Arden LJ in 
Cherry Tree Investments Ltd
 
v. 
Landmain Ltd
[2012] EWCA Civ 736, [2013] Ch 305, [62]). It is no longer necessary to resort to the
remedy of rectification (see 
16.7
) in order to achieve this measure of rewriting. This
change has not been to everyone’s taste. Sir Richard Buxton, writing extrajudicially
(‘“Construction” and Rectification after 
Chartbrook
’ [2010] 
CLJ
 
253, 256), criticized
Lord Hoffmann’s fifth principle on the ground that it was ‘revolutionary because it
overrode the previous understanding that, rectification apart, the court could not depart
from the words of the document to find an agreement different from that stated in the
document’ and that it confused ‘the meaning of what the parties said in the document
with what they meant to say but did not say’. In 
Oceanbulk Shipping and Trading SA
 
v.
TMT Asia Ltd
 
[2010] UKSC 44, [2011] 1 AC 662, [44] Lord Clarke accepted that there
was a ‘close relationship between interpretation and rectification’ but did not otherwise
endorse the criticism of Lord Hoffmann’s fifth principle.
However, it is important to note the limits of Lord Hoffmann’s principle, in particular
the requirement that ‘it should be clear what a reasonable person would have
understood the parties to have meant’. In other words, both the mistake and the
intended outcome must be clear. It does not suffice to establish that it is ‘undoubtedly
possible that something has gone wrong’ It must be ‘clear’ that something has gone
wrong (
Altera Voyageur Production Ltd
 
v. 
Premier Oil E&P UK Ltd
 
[2020] EWHC 1891
(Comm), [2021] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 451, [67]). As Rix LJ observed in 
ING Bank NV
 
v. 
Ros
Roca SA
 
[2011] EWCA Civ 353, [2012] 1 WLR 472, [110], ‘judges should not see in
Chartbrook
 
an open sesame for reconstructing the parties’ contract, but an opportunity
to remedy by construction a clear error of language which could not have been
intended’. Further, construction cannot be ‘pushed beyond its proper limits in pursuit of
remedying what is perceived to be a flaw in the working of a contract’.
This concern to ensure that interpretation is not pushed beyond its proper limits is also
apparent in the judgments of Lord Neuberger in 
Arnold
 
v. 
Britton
 
and Lord Hodge in
Wood
 
v. 
Capita Insurance Services
 
(discussed earlier). In 
Arnold
 
Lord Neuberger’s
warning (at [17]) that considerations of commercial common sense must ‘not be invoked
to undervalue the importance of the language of the provision which is to be construed’
is clearly intended to provide a measure of certainty to contracting parties in cases
where they have drafted a contract the meaning of which is clear. As Lord Clarke
observed in 
Rainy Sky SA
 
v. 
Kookmin Bank
 
[2011] UKSC 50, [2011] 1 WLR 2900, [23],
‘where the parties have used unambiguous language, the court must apply it’. In other
words, where the meaning of the term is clear, 
it is not the function of the court to give it
a different meaning in an attempt to render the term more reasonable or ‘commercially
sensible’. To similar effect is the judgment of Lord Hodge in 
Wood
 
when he stated (at
[13]) that ‘some agreements may be successfully interpreted principally by textual
analysis, for example because of their sophistication and complexity and because they
have been negotiated and prepared with the assistance of skilled professionals’. The
word ‘principally’ is important here. The point being made is not that there is an
exclusive focus on the words used by the parties. Rather, it is that, at least in the case
where the parties have access to legal advice and can be expected to use the English
language properly, the courts will more likely give effect to the intention of the parties if
they give primary weight to the text which the parties have agreed. However, it should
be noted that an emphasis on the meaning of the words used by the parties (and on
giving the words their ordinary and natural meaning) is not to be equated with an over-
literal interpretation of one provision without regard to the whole of the document,
particularly in the case of complex documents which have been put into circulation in
the market (
Metlife Seguros de Retiro SA
 
v. 
JP Morgan Chase Bank, National
Association
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 1248; 
Re Sigma Finance Corp
 
[2009] UKSC 2, [2010] 1
All ER 571).
But this heavy emphasis on the importance of the words used by the parties does not
hold true in all cases. Courts have greater flexibility where the disputed term is capable
of more than one meaning, the contract is badly drafted (see 
Arnold
 
at [18]), the parties’
use of punctuation is erroneous or erratic (
Vitol E&P Ltd
 
v. 
New Age (African Global
Energy) Ltd
 
[2018] EWHC 1580 (Comm), [28]), or the parties are operating in an
informal context (see 
Wood
 
at [13]). In these cases, when considering the alternative
possible meanings of the term, the court should consider which interpretation is the
more commercially sensible and in most cases can be expected to adopt the more, rather
than the less, commercial construction (
Rainy Sky SA
 
v. 
Kookmin Bank
 
[2011] UKSC
50, [2011] 1 WLR 2900, [30]). The court is not, however, obliged to adopt the more
commercially sensible interpretation. There is no rule of law that requires the court to
give effect to the interpretation which is most consistent with business common sense. It
is entitled to prefer that interpretation and it may be generally appropriate to do so but
it is not bound to do so. The more ambiguous the meaning of the term and the stronger
the arguments based on business common sense, the more likely it is to be appropriate
to adopt that interpretation. Or, to put the same point another way, ‘the less the
commercial sense of a construction of an agreement, the greater the need to scrutinise
its literal wording and if possible to depart from it to give a commercially sensible
interpretation’ (
African Minerals Ltd
 
v. 
Renaissance Capital Ltd
 
[2015] EWCA Civ 448,
[40], 
Fomento de Construcciones Y Contratas SA
 
v. 
Black Diamond Offshore Ltd
 
[2016]
EWCA Civ 1141, [12]).
In those cases where the courts do have regard to considerations of commercial
common sense, it is important to note that these considerations are not to be viewed
retrospectively (
Arnold
 
at [19]). Such considerations are not infrequently invoked by
parties who have entered into a bad bargain. But the fact that the bargain has turned out
to be a bad one is not a relevant consideration. The reason for this is that the
consideration of the demands of commercial common sense is to be undertaken at the
moment of entry into the contract, not the date of the breach or the date of the hearing
before the court. As Lord Grabiner has observed (‘The Iterative Process of Contractual
Interpretation’ (2012) 128 
LQR
 
41, 46), it is ‘critically important’ that the commercial
purpose of the disputed clause is ‘derived from the contract as a whole and from an
accurate understanding of the way in which the various provisions interact’ and that it
does not degenerate into ‘little more than an appeal to the court for a more reasonable
result’ (p. 50).
Finally, in this context it is important to stress that it is not the task of the court to write
or make the contract for the parties (see 
Arnold
 
at [20]). As Arden LJ observed in 
Credit
Suisse Asset Management LLC
 
v. 
Titan Europe 2006-1 plc
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 1293, [28],
party autonomy is a fundamental principle of English contract law from which it follows
that the court will not rewrite the bargain that the parties have freely chosen to make
(see also 
BP Gas Marketing Ltd
 
v. 
La Société Sonatrach
 
[2016] EWHC 2461 (Comm),
[274]). This desire to avoid being seen to rewrite the contract for the parties helps to
explain why it is that courts are hesitant to invoke considerations of commercial
common sense in order to override what appears to be the clear meaning of the contract
negotiated by the parties. The jurisdiction to depart from the clear meaning of the words
agreed by the parties must therefore be exercised with considerable caution. Thus in
Carillion Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Emcor Engineering Services Ltd
 
[2017] EWCA Civ 65,
[2017] BLR 203, [46] Jackson LJ stated that it is ‘only in exceptional cases’ that
commercial common sense can ‘drive the court to depart from the natural meaning of
contractual provisions’ (see also 
Grove Developments Ltd
 
v. 
Balfour Beatty Regional
Construction Ltd
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 990, [2017] 1 WLR 1893, [42]). But there does come
a point where the consequences of giving to the words their ordinary and natural
meaning is so absurd that the court will be prepared to depart from that meaning and
adopt a more commercially sensible construction. One such case is 
Sutton Housing
Partnership Ltd
 
v. 
Rydon Maintenance Ltd
 
[2017] EWCA Civ 359, where the Court of
Appeal rejected the defendant’s construction of the contract on the ground that it would
have rendered inoperable important parts of the contract. These consequences were
held to be ‘extraordinary’ and to amount to ‘an absurdity, which no-one could have
intended’. The claimant’s interpretation was accepted on the basis that it was ‘the only
rational interpretation of the curious provisions into which the parties have entered’.
However, it is important to remember that 
Sutton Housing Partnership
 
is the
exception, not the rule. In the standard case, where the parties have access to legal
advice, the court is more likely to give greater weight to the words used by the parties
and to give them their ordinary and natural meaning because in doing so they will give
effect to the intention of the parties, objectively ascertained.

Boilerplate Clauses
Central Issues
Contracting parties frequently have a set of standard terms and
conditions which they seek to incorporate into all the contracts which
they conclude. In the case of more complex contracts they will also
have a set of clauses (generally referred to as ‘boilerplate clauses’)
which they will attempt to incorporate into these contracts. Some of
these standard terms can be the subject of protracted negotiations
between the parties. These standard terms therefore assume
considerable significance in commercial practice.
The aim of this chapter is not to examine the content of these standard
terms in detail. Rather, it is to identify, and briefly examine, some of
the standard terms and to outline the structure of modern commercial
contracts.
12.1
 
Introduction
The aim of this chapter is not to examine contracting practices as such. Such an
enterprise would require not only a separate book but a major research project to
examine the diverse contracting practices that exist throughout the country. While there
have been some extremely valuable analyses of contracting practices in certain sectors of
the economy or certain geographical areas (see, for example, H Beale and A Dugdale,
‘Contracts Between Businessmen: Planning and the Use of Contractual Remedies’ (1975)
2 
British Journal of Law and Society
 
45 and R Lewis, ‘Contracts Between Businessmen:
Reform of the Law of Firm Offers and an Empirical Study of Tendering Practices in the
Building Industry’ (1982) 9 
Journal of Law and Society
 
153), there remains a great deal
to be done in terms of obtaining information about the way in which contracts are
concluded and their content. The study carried out by Beale and Dugdale in the early
1970s consisted of interviews with ‘representatives of nineteen firms of engineering
manufacturers, mainly in Bristol, about their firm’s contracts of purchase and sale’. One
of the principal points that emerged from this study was the relatively limited use that
was made by the parties of the law of contract in the regulation of their relationships.
But it would be dangerous to generalize from this study and conclude that contracting
parties generally make little use of the rules 
of law. Thus Beale, Bishop, and Furmston
(
Contract Cases and Materials
 
(5th edn, Oxford University Press, 2008)) conclude (at
p. 83):
[A]lthough this study suggests that some businesses make only limited use of contract law, it must be
remembered that it was studying only a small sample from one industry. Other trades may well demonstrate a
much more ‘legalistic’ approach: for instance, a glance into Lloyd’s Reports, which concentrate on commercial
cases, suggests that businesses in some commodity trades and in the charter markets litigate much more
regularly—frequently taking points that lack any real merit in order to escape unprofitable contracts … The
contracts seem to have been planned in quite some detail …
Even in those cases where the relationship between the parties is heavily influenced by
informal understandings, it should not be assumed that this is to the exclusion of the
formal terms of the contract. In many cases the relationship between the parties is
governed both by informal understandings (or ‘relational norms’) and by the formal
contract document and the rules of contract law. The extent of the influence of these
different factors is likely to depend upon the circumstances of the individual case (see
generally C Mitchell, ‘Contracts and Contract Law: Challenging the Distinction Between
the “Real” and the “Paper” Deal’ (2009) 29 
OJLS
 
675).
The aim of the chapter is to examine some of the principal standard terms used in
commercial contracts today. The examination is limited in two important respects. First,
it is confined to commercial contracts. Contracts concluded informally between
members of the public are not examined at all. Contracts between businesses and
consumers also fall largely outside the scope of this chapter. They are included to the
extent that many businesses seek to incorporate their standard terms and conditions
into contracts with consumers as well as with other businesses. But the regulation of
these standard terms as they apply to consumer contracts raises distinct issues which
are examined in 
Chapter 14
. Secondly, this chapter is confined to terms that will, in all
probability, have been drafted by lawyers. It therefore examines the clauses very much
through the lens of a lawyer. It does not purport to examine more informal methods of
contracting that may be developed by businesses (important though these methods may
be in practice).
12.2
 
Boilerplate Clauses and Standard
Terms
Standard terms can be divided into two broad groups. The first consists of standard
terms that are inserted into a written contract which has been drawn up by the
contracting parties (more usually, their lawyers). These are often known as ‘boilerplate
clauses’. The second consists of a set of standard terms and conditions which a business
attempts to incorporate into all of its contracts. These terms are often appended to an
order form or are incorporated into the standard documentation sent out on behalf of
the business whenever a transaction is concluded. The distinction between these two
groups is a very loose one. A term can be both a boilerplate clause inserted into a written
contract and a term that is included in a standard set of terms and conditions. The
distinction that is drawn relates not to the substance of the term itself but to the process
by which the contract is concluded. The first group consists of cases where two parties
negotiate a contract and then draw up a formal written contract which records the
agreement that the parties have reached. The second 
group is made up of those cases in
which one party sends out an order form on his own standard terms of business and the
other party ‘accepts’ the order and in doing so often sends back his own terms and
conditions (the so-called ‘battle of the forms’ discussed at 
3.3.1
). In the first situation it
is important to see the boilerplate clauses in their context. The first extract, taken from a
book by Richard Christou, does this by locating the discussion of boilerplate clauses
within the structure of the agreement as a whole. The second extract, taken from
Schmitthoff’s Export Trade
, sets out a list of commonly used standard form clauses.
These are particularly suitable for incorporation in a set of standard terms and
conditions but they can also be incorporated into a written contract as one of the
boilerplate clauses. The section that follows these two extracts is devoted to a brief
examination of the standard clauses listed in 
Schmitthoff
 
and will also include one or
two other boilerplate clauses not included in that list.
R CHRISTOU, 
BOILERPLATE: PRACTICAL CLAUSES
(8th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020), paras 1-002–1-004 and 1-009–1-034
1-002 The term ‘boilerplate’ is most properly used in its widest sense to describe
the clauses, common to nearly all commercial contracts, which deal with the way in
which the contract itself operates, as opposed to the rights of the parties under the
particular transaction that they have agreed upon and embodied in the substantive
clauses. Boilerplate clauses regulate, control, and in some cases modify, these
substantive rights and their operation and enforcement. They are thus a vital part
of every contract, without which the substantive rights of the parties embodied in
the agreement would have little meaning.
1-003
 
If one can take an analogy from the field of computing, boilerplate is like
the operating system of a computer, while the substantive content of the contract
relating to the particular transaction could be likened to the application software. All
commercial contracts have an underlying ‘operating system’ that is (at least in the
jurisdictions based on common law and even in some others) approximately the
same.
1-004
 
In the absence of boilerplate the parties must rely on the general
system of law applicable to the contract, and ask the court to apply this in settling
disputes. In extreme cases, however, even the systems of law to be applied, and
the question of which court has jurisdiction, would have to be decided by reference
to some system of private international law. This approach defeats the whole aim
of commercial contracts: to create certainty in dealings between the parties, and to
provide an easy method of enforcement of rights where necessary …
The different parts of a commercial contract
(a)
 
Designation of the parties
1-009 At the head of the contract it is usual to set out the names and identifying
details of each of the parties. Although it is not uncommon to preface this section
with a statement such as ‘This Agreement is made the … … … day of 20 … … ’,
this is not legally necessary. It is vital, however, that the agreement states from
what date it is effective. The actual date upon which the agreement is signed (if
this is different to the effective date) is therefore desirable but not essential.
(b)
 
Recitals
1-010 After the details of the parties, a set of paragraphs called recitals will usually
appear. These set out the background to the transaction and the purpose for which
the parties are entering into the transaction. It is not legally necessary to include
recitals in a contract, but it is customary to do so. However … current drafting
practice is to keep recitals as short as possible. Without express words later on in
the agreement, recitals are not regarded as a part of the agreement which actually
gives rise to legal obligations, and yet they will, at the least, be taken into account
by a court which has to interpret the substantive portion of the agreement. Even
worse, a court may regard them as, or as evidence of, pre-contract
representations, the breach of which would ground an action for misrepresentation
…
(c)
 
Definitions
1-014 Although it is possible to insert definitions in any of the foregoing or in
substantive parts of the agreement, where there are a great many definitions it is
usual to arrange them together in a separate section straight after the recitals. As a
drafting tip, it can be easier to insert definitions throughout the agreement, as
drafting the clauses throws up the need for them, and then to remove these
definitions at the end, collect and edit them, and arrange them in a suitable order
(either alphabetical or logical) in the initial definition section.
1-015
 
The definitions form part of the substantive agreement because they
prescribe that certain terms shall mean certain things. This prescriptive language
can take various forms. The most unambiguous is: ‘In this Agreement A shall mean
B’. Another form often used, is: ‘Where the context so admits, in this Agreement A
shall mean B’. A third form provides a partial definition: ‘In this Agreement [where
the context so admits] A includes B’. An example of this is: ‘In this Agreement
“taxation” includes income tax, corporation tax and value added tax’. We do not
have a complete definition of ‘taxation’, but do know some items which are
included in the term. The parties are left free to argue, by reference to the ordinary
dictionary meaning of taxation, whether other items such as stamp duty or
inheritance tax fall within the definition or not …
1-018
 
Besides pure definitions, this section will also contain general
interpretation clauses …
(d)
 
Substantive clauses
1-019 After the definitions follow the main clauses of the agreement—the
substantive provisions. These clauses are sometimes introduced by: ‘Now it is
hereby agreed as follows … ’ Although customary, this phrase does not appear to
serve any legal purpose, since the substantive clauses will obviously be seen as
matters upon which the parties are agreeing.
(e)
 
Schedules
1-020 To ensure that the logical flow of the substantive clauses is not interrupted
and obscured with a great deal of detail, it is useful to put many of the more
detailed substantive provisions into schedules. A clause in the substantive part of
the agreement could read: ‘All sales to be made by the Seller shall be upon the
terms and conditions set out in Schedule … ’ The schedule concerned could then
set out a detailed set of conditions of sale which, had they been left within the main
clauses, would have completely disrupted their sequence.
1-021
 
Another use for schedules is to remove transaction-specific details so
that the main document can be more easily used as a standard form. Standard
form distributor or agency agreements, for example, usually place details of the
products, territories covered and sales targets within the schedules.
1-022
 
Schedules are a substantive and integral part of the agreement, and
there should always be a specific provision in the main clauses stating that this is
so.
(f)
 
Appendices
1-023 Where documents are referred to in an agreement they are often attached
as appendices so that they can be easily referred to. Such appendices are usually
signed by the parties by way of identification of the document concerned.
1-024
 
Such documents are not necessarily part of the agreement. For
instance, a warranty can be given that a set of accounts, or a copy of a
memorandum and articles attached as an appendix, is true and correct. The
document is then attached for reference but its provisions are not incorporated in
the agreement. Where a document is actually incorporated by reference (for
example a set of standard conditions of sale or a technical specification) the
document is sometimes also attached as an appendix. However, even in this case,
the 
provisions
 
of the document are incorporated by reference in the main clause,
but the appended copy of the document only serves as a record of those terms
and is not itself a part of the agreement.
(g)
 
Signature section
1-025 This section should come after the schedules and before the appendices. It
is often, but need not be, introduced with wording such as: ‘The duly authorised
representatives of the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands, the day and
year first above written’. A shorter and equally acceptable method is ‘Signed by X
for and on behalf of ABC Ltd’ followed by X’s signature.
1-026
 
Commercial agreements do not normally need witnesses to the
signatures: they are certainly not necessary under English law.
1-027
 
Most commercial agreements are just signed … and not executed as
deeds … One great advantage (or drawback, depending upon which party is
concerned) to the use of a deed under English law, is that the statute of limitations
prescribes 12 years for an action on a deed, but only six years for a document
under hand.
1-028
 
Deeds are also used by bodies such as local authorities in England and
Wales whose processes for authorisation of signature of contracts are very
complicated …
1-029
 
Mention should also be made of the possibilities for the electronic
signature of contracts …
(h)
 
Counterparts and copies
1-031 Copies of commercial documents are usually supplied for each of the
parties: these are signed by all the parties and include a special counterpart
clause, inserted to make each of them fully signed original copies for the purposes
of enforcement. As an alternative to counterparts, there is sometimes only one
original, with the other parties being given certified copies which are regarded as
equivalent to originals.
1-032
 
So-called ‘conformed’ copies are sometime produced following
signature. These are copies of documents which contain manuscript amendments
made at the last minute, or illegible signatures. The manuscript words (including
the signatures) are reproduced in the documents in typed form. Such copies are
obviously not originals and are often just used for ease of reference, but they may
also, of course, be certified copies.
(i)
 
Headings and contents pages
1-033 Headings to clauses, sections and schedules, and contents pages, are often
introduced into long documents for ease of reference. Such matters should not
constitute part of the 
agreement or their drafting becomes too complicated and
they no longer serve the purpose of providing easy reference guides. Usually a
provision appears in the substantive clauses stating that this is the case.
(j)
 
Contract numbering systems
1-034 Numbering systems can vary. Traditionally, they consist of hierarchical
mixtures of Arabic and Roman numerals and letters of the alphabet. In a long
document one spends more time than it is worth working out and adjusting such
hierarchies and keeping them consistent. The aim of all numbering systems is to
provide a unique and easy way of referring to each part of each clause of the
contract.
C MURRAY, D HOLLOWAY, AND D TIMSON-HUNT,
SCHMITTHOFF’S EXPORT TRADE: THE LAW AND
PRACTICE OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE
(12th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2012), paras 32–014 and 32–015
The importance, for international sales, of well-drafted general terms of business
can hardly be exaggerated. They are particularly important where neither uniform
conditions of export sales nor standard contract forms are used. Litigation can
often be avoided when the seller is able to refer the buyer to a clause in his printed
terms of business which was embodied in the quotation or acceptance, and the
fact that these terms apply to all transactions concluded by the seller adds
persuasive force to his argument.

(f)
(g)
(h)
The most important clauses which the exporter should incorporate in his general
terms of business are:
general clause, which subjects every contract of sale to the seller’s
conditions of sale;
retention of title clause, which provides that until the seller receives the
purchase price fully in cash,
the seller retains the legal property in the goods and is given the
irrevocable right to enter the premises of the buyer at any time and
without notice in order to retake possession of the goods, and
the buyer may resell the goods only as an agent of the seller and
only in the ordinary course of business to a bona fide repurchaser
and, if he does so, shall receive the proceeds of the resale as an
agent of and trustee for the seller and shall place the proceeds of
sale in a separate account in the name of the seller;
price escalation clause, which provides that unless firm prices and charges
are agreed upon, the seller shall be entitled to increase the agreed prices
and charges in the same proportion in which the prices or charges of the
goods or their components, including costs of labour to be paid or borne by
the seller, have been increased between the date of the quotation and the
date of the delivery;
interest, which provides where payment is made after the agreed date,
interest shall be paid at a specified rate;
force majeure clause …;
choice of law clause, which specifies that the contract be governed by
English law;
arbitration, which provides that any disputes between the parties are to be
settled by arbitration; or
jurisdiction, providing for the jurisdiction of the English courts.
12.3
 
Boilerplate Clauses: Some Illustrations
This section is devoted to an analysis of some standard or boilerplate clauses. It takes as
its starting point the clauses listed in 
Schmitthoff
. But it also adds one or two additional
clauses. Schmitthoff’s list is directed towards export sellers and it is therefore necessary
to supplement it by reference to standard terms that are found in other types of contract.
12.3.1
 
General Clause
While many sellers include such a ‘general clause’ in their standard terms, it by no
means follows that it will be effective. The sellers in 
Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd
 
v. 
Ex-
Cell-O Corporation (England) Ltd
 
[1979] 1 WLR 401 (
3.3.1
) included such a clause in
their standard terms. The clause there stated:
All orders are accepted only upon and subject to the terms set out in our quotation and the following conditions.
These terms and conditions shall prevail over any terms and conditions in the Buyer’s order.
The clause was not effective to achieve its goal because the sellers, in signing the buyer’s
tear-off acknowledgement slip, were held to have entered into a contract on the buyer’s
standard terms of business. While the clause may not work in a given fact situation, it is
nevertheless included in standard terms and conditions.
12.3.2
 
Retention of Title Clauses
The aim of this type of clause is to protect the seller in the event of the insolvency of the
buyer. While such a clause is commonly found in sellers’ standard terms and conditions
it is by no means certain that it will achieve its goal. The case-law on retention of title
clauses is difficult. Retention of title clauses came to prominence as a result of the
decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Aluminium Industrie Vaasen BV
 
v. 
Romalpa
Aluminium Ltd
 
[1976] 1 WLR 676, where a retention of title clause was held to be
effective not only to reserve to the sellers property in the goods sold to the buyer but also
to trace into the proceeds of sub-sales which had been entered into by the buyer, where
the goods the subject matter of the sub-sales included goods supplied by the sellers to
the buyer. The clause stated:
The ownership of the material to be delivered by A.I.V. will only be transferred to purchaser when he has met all
that is owing to A.I.V., no matter on what grounds. Until the date of payment, purchaser, if A.I.V. so desires, is
required to store this material in such a way that it 
is clearly the property of A.I.V. A.I.V. and purchaser agree
that, if purchaser should make (a) new object(s) from the material, mix this material with (an) other object(s) or
if this material in any way whatsoever becomes a constituent of (an) other object(s) A.I.V. will be given the
ownership of this (these) new object(s) as surety of the full payment of what purchaser owes A.I.V. To this end
A.I.V. and purchaser now agree that the ownership of the article(s) in question, whether finished or not, are to
be transferred to A.I.V. and that this transfer of ownership will be considered to have taken place through and at
the moment of the single operation or event by which the material is converted into (a) new object(s), or is
mixed with or becomes a constituent of (an) other object(s). Until the moment of full payment of what
purchaser owes A.I.V. purchaser shall keep the object(s) in question for A.I.V. in his capacity of fiduciary owner
and, if required, shall store this (these) object(s) in such a way that it (they) can be recognized as such.
Nevertheless, purchaser will be entitled to sell these objects to a third party within the framework of the normal
carrying on of his business and to deliver them on condition that—if A.I.V. so requires—purchaser as long as he
has not fully discharged his debt to A.I.V. shall hand over to A.I.V. the claims he has against his buyer
emanating from this transaction.
Two points are worth noting about this clause. The first is its length and the second is
the fact that it is not very well drafted. Notwithstanding its obvious shortcomings the
Court of Appeal held that it was effective to entitle the sellers to claim the proceeds of
the sub-sales entered into by the buyer in priority to the secured and unsecured
creditors of the insolvent buyer. The result was to confer a right of enormous value on
the sellers in the insolvency of the buyers. It is not surprising, in the light of this
decision, that sellers immediately began to insert retention of title clauses into their
standard terms. Since 
Romalpa
 
was decided, however, the courts have taken a more
restrictive view of the efficacy of retention of title clauses. While they continue to be
effective where the goods which have been sold to the buyers have not been mixed
irrevocably with other goods (
Hendy Lennox (Industrial Engines) Ltd
 
v. 
Graham
Puttick Ltd
 
[1984] 1 WLR 485; 
Armour
 
v. 
Thyssen Edelstahlwerke
 
[1991] 2 AC 339),
they are generally not effective where the goods have been mixed irrevocably (
Borden
(UK) Ltd
 
v. 
Scottish Timber Products Ltd
 
[1981] Ch 25) nor in relation to attempts to
trace into the proceeds of sub-sales (
Compaq Computer Ltd
 
v. 
Abercorn Group Ltd
[1991] BCC 484). The drafting of the clause in the example given by Schmitthoff is based
on 
Romalpa
 
but, in the light of cases such as 
Compaq
 
v. 
Abercorn
, it is probably
ineffective to enable the sellers to claim the proceeds of any sub-sales. It is necessary to
take great care when drafting a retention of title clause but even a well-drafted clause
may be held to be ineffective to entitle a seller to trace into the proceeds of sub-sales (see
Compaq
 
v. 
Abercorn
).
12.3.3
 
Price Escalation Clauses
Price escalation clauses are of considerable importance to sellers in long-term contracts
and in cases where there is a time-lag between entry into the contract and the time at
which the buyer is to pay for the goods or services supplied by the seller. The clause that
was in issue between the parties in 
Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd
 
v. 
Ex-Cell-O
Corporation (England) Ltd
 
[1979] 1 WLR 401 was a price variation or a price escalation
clause (see clause 3 of the sellers’ terms and conditions, set out at 
3.3.1
). As 
Butler
demonstrates, it is important not only to ensure that standard terms are properly
drafted but also to ensure that they are incorporated into the contracts that the sellers
conclude.
12.3.4
 
Interest
The reason for inserting a clause into the contract dealing with interest is that until
recently the common law rule was that interest could not be recovered as damages in
respect of a failure to pay a debt when it fell due. It was therefore necessary for the
parties to create a contractual right to interest by an appropriately drafted term of the
contract. The need for a contractual term entitling a party to recover interest has been
reduced by the enactment of the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.
Section 1(1) of the Act provides that:
It is an implied term in a contract to which this Act applies that any qualifying debt created by the contract
carries simple interest subject to and in accordance with this Part.
Section 2(1) of the Act states that the Act applies to:
a contract for the supply of goods or services where the purchaser and the supplier are each acting in the course
of a business, other than an excepted contract.
A debt is a ‘qualifying debt’ unless it consists of a sum to which a right to interest or to
charge interest arises by virtue of some other enactment. The parties remain free to
make their own provision for the payment of interest (and many contracting parties
continue to make their own provision in their contracts), although any attempt to
exclude the right to statutory interest in relation to the debt is void unless the contract
provides a ‘substantial contractual remedy for late payment of the debt’ (see sections 8
and 9 of the Act).
12.3.5
 
Force Majeure Clauses
A force majeure clause is a clause which entitles a party to suspend or terminate the
contract on the occurrence of an event which is beyond the control of the parties and
which prevents, impedes, or delays the performance of the contract (see more generally
E McKendrick, ‘Force Majeure Clauses: The Gap between Doctrine and Practice’ in A
Burrows and E Peel (eds), 
Contract Terms
 
(Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 233). The
precise scope of the clause will depend upon its wording and the details of the clause
may be the subject of difficult negotiations between the parties. Force majeure clauses
are generally inserted into contracts because the doctrine of frustration operates within
very narrow limits (see 
21.1
). Given that the courts are unwilling to adjust the contract in
the event that performance becomes more onerous for one party, contracting parties
who wish to preserve to themselves a degree of flexibility in the performance of a
contract may agree to insert a force majeure clause into their contract. An example of a
force majeure clause is provided by clause 17 of the contract between the parties in 
J
Lauritzen AS
 
v. 
Wijsmuller BV (The ‘Super Servant Two’)
 
[1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1
(reproduced at 
21.4
).
A rather more complex force majeure clause was the version of clause 22 of GAFTA 100
that was litigated in 
Toepfer
 
v. 
Cremer
 
[1975] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 118. It provided:
Sellers shall not be responsible for delay in shipment of the goods or any part thereof occasioned by any Act of
God, strike, lockout, riot or civil commotion, combination of workmen, breakdown of machinery, fire or any
cause comprehended in the term ‘force majeure’. If delay in shipment is likely to occur for any of the above
reasons, Shippers shall give notice to their Buyers by telegram, telex or teleprinter or by similar advice within 7
consecutive days of the occurrence, or not less than 21 consecutive days before the commencement of the
contract period, whichever is later. The notice shall state the reason(s) for the anticipated delay. If after giving
such notice an extension to the shipping period is required, then Shippers shall give further notice not later than
2 business days after the last day of the contract period of shipment stating the port or ports of loading from
which the goods were intended to be shipped, and shipments effected after the contract period shall be limited
to the port or ports so nominated. If shipment be delayed for more than one calendar month, Buyers shall have
the option of cancelling the delayed portion of the contract, such option to be exercised by Buyers giving notice
to be received by Sellers not later than the first business day after the additional calendar month. If Buyers do
not exercise this option, such delayed portion shall be automatically extended for a further period of one month.
If shipment under this clause be prevented during the further one month’s extension, the contract shall be
considered void. Buyers shall have no claim against Sellers for delay or non-shipment under this clause
provided that Sellers shall have supplied to Buyers, if required, satisfactory evidence justifying the delay or non-
fulfilment.
There are three principal components of a force majeure clause. The first and most
important component is the description of the events that trigger the operation of the
clause. There is no legal doctrine of force majeure in English law and so the phrase ‘force
majeure’ is not a term of art (see 
Thomas Borthwick (Glasgow) Ltd
 
v. 
Faure Fairclough
Ltd
 
[1968] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 16, 28). It is therefore for the parties to define the list of events
which they intend should fall within the scope of the clause. The events included in the
list are generally events that are beyond the control of the parties, such as acts of God
and war. Not much significance tends to be attached to the words ‘force majeure’
themselves. Either the event will fall within the list of specific events listed in the clause
or it will fall within the general words at the end of the clause. But it is rare for any
dispute between the parties to focus explicitly on the words ‘force majeure’. The
description of the force majeure events is generally divided into two parts. The first part
consists of a list of specific events. The length of the list can vary enormously.
Sometimes it is very short; at other times, it can be very long. The second part consists
of a general provision which is intended to cover events not included in the specific list.
Views differ as to the utility of the specific list. Some draftsmen are of the view that it is
largely useless and that it suffices to use general words only. Others prefer the list on the
ground that it can help reduce disputes over whether events, such as strikes, fall within
the scope of the clause (although in the case of internal industrial action it can be
difficult to persuade a court that it falls within the scope of a force majeure clause: see 
B
& S Contracts and Design Ltd
 
v. 
Victor Green Publications Ltd
 
[1984] ICR 419).
The second component of a force majeure clause consists of the obligations of the
parties in relation to the reporting of the occurrence of a force majeure event. Not all
force majeure clauses set out the obligations of the parties in this regard. The clause in
Super Servant Two
 
does not, whereas the more elaborate clause in 
Toepfer
 
does set out
the procedure to be followed by the parties. The reporting obligations of the parties
should cover matters such as the person to whom the report is to be made, the time at
which the report is to be made, the form it should take, and the consequences of a failure
to make a report in the prescribed fashion.
The third component consists of the remedial consequences of the occurrence of a force
majeure event. Once again, the clause in 
Super Servant Two
 
is in a simple form in that
it only provides for a right to cancel the contract. The clause in 
Toepfer
 
is a little more
elaborate in that it makes provision for the extension of the contract as well as the
possibility of cancellation. Force majeure clauses in fact give to the parties a high degree
of remedial flexibility. Thus provision can be made for the granting of extensions of
time, the suspension or variation of the contract, or even the termination of the contract.
It is common for parties to make provision for the initial suspension of the contract
which can lead to termination should the force majeure event continue to prevent or
impede performance for a considerable period of time (such as twenty-eight days). The
remedial flexibility that a force majeure clause potentially affords to the parties
compares favourably with the remedial rigidity of the doctrine of frustration (on which
see 
21.6
).
12.3.6
 
Choice of Law Clauses
A choice of law clause assumes considerable significance when dealing with a
contracting party from another jurisdiction. Take the example of a contract concluded
between a seller in England and a buyer in France. The seller is likely to wish to have the
contract governed by English law, whereas the buyer will, in all probability, wish to
ensure that the contract is governed by French law. This gives rise to what is known as
the conflict of laws. What is to happen in such a case? The answer depends upon the
parties. The law allows the parties considerable freedom to choose the law that is to
govern the transaction. Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 on the law applicable
to contractual obligations (generally referred to as ‘Rome I’), which now takes effect
within the UK as part of retained EU law, provides:
A contract shall be governed by the law chosen by the parties. The choice shall be made expressly or clearly
demonstrated by the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case. By their choice the parties can select
the law applicable to the whole or to part only of the contract.
A number of points should be noted about this provision. First, it gives effect to the
principle of party autonomy as it clearly sets out the freedom of contracting parties to
choose the law that is to govern their contract. Secondly, the choice made by the parties
must be the choice of a ‘law’ which, for this purpose, is to be equated with the law of a
domestic legal system. Thus, to revert to our example, the parties could choose as the
law to govern their contract either the law of England or the law of France. However, it
is also open to them to choose the law of another jurisdiction, for example, the law of
Spain, although there are practical reasons which might incline the parties against
making such a choice. In particular, contracting parties can be expected to be slow to
choose a law with which neither party is familiar and which would require both parties
to incur the expense of instructing lawyers who practise in that jurisdiction. That said,
neither party may be willing to agree that the contract should be governed by the law of
the other party and in such a case they may agree to accept the law of a third country,
possibly a jurisdiction which is seen by both parties to be both suitable and neutral,
rather than leave the issue unresolved. The requirement that the parties choose a ‘law’
has the consequence that the choice of the Unidroit Principles or the Principles of
European Contract Law does not satisfy the requirements of Article 3 
given that neither
is legally binding and therefore cannot constitute a ‘law’ for this purpose. A similar
conclusion applies where the parties choose ‘general principles of law’ or the 
lex
mercatoria
 
to govern their contract because neither qualifies as law in the sense in
which that term is used in Article 3.
Thirdly, the choice must be made ‘expressly or clearly demonstrated’. The responsibility
is thus placed on the parties to make an actual choice of the governing law. It is not for
the court to imply or to infer a choice of law. Finally, the freedom of the parties extends
to choosing a law to govern part only of the contract so that parties need not choose a
single law to apply to the whole of their transaction (although there are often strong
practical reasons which support the choice of a single law to govern the transaction
rather than seeking to parcel out the different parts of the contract across different
laws).
Greater difficulty arises in the case where the parties do not make an express choice of
law. In such a case Article 4 of Rome I sets out various rules which are to be applied in
determining the law that is to govern the contract. While these rules go some way to
providing some certainty in terms of the identification of the governing law, they are no
substitute for an express choice of law and so contracting parties who deal with foreign
parties should wherever possible insert a choice of law clause into their contracts and
into their standard terms and conditions of business.
12.3.7
 
Arbitration Clauses
Parties frequently make provision in their contracts for the dispute resolution
mechanism that is to apply in the event of a dispute between them arising out of their
contract. The principal choice which the parties must make is between arbitration and
litigation (although mediation and alternative dispute resolution (‘ADR’) are becoming
increasingly common in commercial practice). Arbitration is commonly associated with
international contracts. Arbitration is claimed to have a number of advantages. First, it
is private. It does not take place in a public court and the result of the arbitration is not
publicly available. Secondly, it can have the appearance of neutrality in that it can take
place at a neutral venue (unlike litigation which will often take place in the courts of the
country of one of the parties to the contract). Thirdly, arbitration is more flexible in that
the parties can choose where and when to arbitrate, they can often choose their
arbitrators, and they can also decide, albeit within limits, the form that the arbitration is
to assume. Party autonomy is a very important principle in international arbitration.
Fourthly, arbitration is said to be speedier than litigation and finally it is often claimed
to be cheaper.
These arguments are not, however, conclusive. Arbitration does have its disadvantages.
It can be very expensive and it is not necessarily quick. A party who loses an arbitration
may decide to appeal to the courts and, if the courts accept that they have jurisdiction to
hear the appeal, the parties’ privacy is lost as may be all hope of a quick and relatively
inexpensive conclusion to the proceedings. Some of the awards issued by arbitrators are
also of rather doubtful pedigree. The quality control in litigation appears to be much
higher than in the case of arbitration. The parties therefore have to make a choice as to
the form of dispute resolution mechanism that they wish to utilize. There is no
requirement that they make that choice at the moment of entry into the contract. They
can defer the decision until such time as a dispute occurs between the parties. But many
parties do make the decision at the time of entry into the contract.
Parties who wish to ensure that disputes arising out of their contract are referred to
arbitration rather than litigation must draft a suitably worded arbitration clause and the
clause 
must be drafted with care. It is not necessary to go into the drafting details here.
It suffices to give two examples of an arbitration clause, one taken from an international
arbitral institution and the other from a clause in the contract between the parties in one
of the leading contract cases in recent years. The clause taken from the international
arbitral institution is the UNCITRAL Model Arbitration clause which provides:
[A]ny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach, termination or
invalidity thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as at
present in force.
The clause taken from the leading case is the opening part of the arbitration clause
agreed between the parties in 
Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Panatown Ltd
[2001] 1 AC 518 (discussed in more detail at 
23.3.2
). Clause 39.1 of the contract
provided:
When the Employer or the Contractor require a dispute or difference as referred to in Article 5 to be referred to
arbitration then either the Employer or the Contractor shall give written notice to the other to such effect and
such dispute or difference shall be referred to the arbitration and final decision of a person to be agreed between
the parties as the Arbitrator, or, upon the failure so to agree within 14 days after the date of the aforesaid
written notice, of a person to be appointed as the Arbitrator on the request of either the Employer or the
Contractor by the person named in Appendix 1 to the Conditions.
One of the interesting features of the litigation between Panatown and McAlpine was
that the corporate group of which Panatown was a member had a choice between
litigating the dispute with McAlpine in the courts or invoking the arbitration clause in
the contract between Panatown and McAlpine. They chose the latter option. With the
benefit of hindsight it can be seen that the choice was a dubious one because McAlpine
exercised its rights under the contract to appeal to the High Court against the
provisional award of the arbitrator. So, in the event, the parties found themselves
embroiled in complex litigation as well as arbitration (see further E McKendrick, ‘The
Common Law at Work: The Saga of 
Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Panatown Ltd
’
(2003) 3 
Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal
 
145). The choice between
arbitration and litigation is an important one that must be made with some care.
12.3.8
 
Jurisdiction Clauses
If litigation is the preferred method of dispute resolution then consideration ought to be
given to the jurisdiction in which the dispute is to be litigated. Jurisdiction is, however, a
complex subject and it has become even more complex as a result of the departure of the
UK from the EU. Prior to the UK’s departure from the EU, contracting parties had
considerable freedom of choice in relation to the selection of the appropriate jurisdiction
(a)
(b)
(c)
(see Article 25(1) of EU Regulation No 1215/2012 of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction
and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters,
more commonly known as Brussels 1 recast) and, further, parties had confidence that
judgments given by the chosen court would be enforced within the EU. However, to the
disappointment of many commercial practitioners, the UK revoked the Brussels
Regulation on its departure from the EU. The gap has to some extent been filled by the
UK acceding to the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the details
of which are beyond the scope of this book) 
but the latter Convention does not presently
have the same proven efficacy as the Brussels Regulation and, as a result, choice of
jurisdiction has become a more difficult matter for practitioners in the UK than was
previously the case. We shall, however, encounter jurisdiction clauses in the context of
the important decision of the Privy Council in 
The Mahkutai
 
[1996] AC 696, a case
which is discussed at some length at 
25.3.4
.
Some other standard terms not mentioned in 
Schmitthoff
 
are as follows:
12.3.9
 
Hardship Clauses
A clause which is frequently inserted into a contract to deal with unforeseen events
which make performance of the contract more onerous than originally anticipated is a
hardship clause. The practical significance of hardship clauses has increased
significantly because of the current Covid-19 pandemic where hardship clauses offer to
contracting parties a means by which they might seek to share the losses suffered by
many businesses as a result of the ongoing pandemic. An example of such a clause can
be found in 
Superior Overseas Development Corporation
 
v. 
British Gas Corporation
[1982] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 262, 264–265 in the following terms:
If at any time or from time to time during the contract period there has been any substantial change in
the economic circumstances relating to this Agreement and (notwithstanding the effect of the other
relieving or adjusting provisions of this Agreement) either party feels that such change is causing it to
suffer substantial economic hardship then parties shall (at the request of either of them) meet together
to consider what (if any) adjustments(s) in the prices … are justified in the circumstances in fairness to
the parties to offset or alleviate the said hardship caused by such change.
If the parties shall not within ninety (90) days after any such request have reached agreement on the
adjustments (if any) in the said prices … the matter may forthwith be referred by either party for
determination by experts …
The experts shall determine what (if any) adjustments in the said prices or in the said price revision
mechanism shall be made … and any revised prices or any change in the price revision mechanism so
determined by such experts shall take effect six (6) months after the date on which the request for review
was first made.
Such a clause should define the circumstances in which ‘hardship’ exists and should
then lay down a procedure to be adopted in the event that these circumstances occur.
The vitally important matter is to ensure that the clause provides a mechanism or a
sanction to be applied in the event that the parties fail to reach agreement or refuse to
enter into negotiations with a view to adjusting the contract. A common sanction,
employed in 
Superior Overseas Development Corporation
, is to provide for the
intervention of a third party expert or arbitrators (but not a judge sitting in a court of
law) should the parties fail to reach agreement themselves.
The advantage of a hardship clause is that it is designed to enable the relationship
between the parties to continue, albeit on different terms. Given that the courts at
common law have no power to adjust the terms of a contract to meet changed
circumstances (see 
21.6
), this can be a useful clause to incorporate should the parties
wish to make provision for the adjustment (rather than the suspension or termination)
of the contract.
12.3.10
 
Entire Agreement Clauses
Entire agreement clauses are frequently relied upon in an attempt to prevent one party
from asserting that the written contract is not the sole repository of the terms of the
contract and that there is in fact another term of the contract which has been broken by
the other party. The aim is thus to prevent liability arising for breach of contract outside
of the terms of the written agreement. Entire agreement clauses can also be utilized for
another purpose, namely to attempt to eliminate any possible liability for
misrepresentation. Not all entire agreement clauses attempt to fulfil this second
function. For example, in 
Deepak Fertilisers and Petrochemicals Corporation
 
v. 
ICI
Chemicals & Polymers Ltd
 
[1999] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 387 the entire agreement clause
consisted of the following:
This contract comprises the entire agreement between the parties, as detailed in the various Articles and
Annexures and there are not any agreements, understandings, promises or conditions, oral or written,
expressed or implied, concerning the subject matter which are not merged into this contract and superseded
hereby. This contract may be amended in the future only in writing executed by the parties.
It was held that this clause was effective to exclude liability in respect of a collateral
warranty. But it does not attempt to exclude liability for misrepresentation. A slightly
more elaborate entire agreement clause is illustrated by 
Watford Electronics Ltd
 
v.
Sanderson CFL Ltd
 
[2001] All ER (Comm) 696, where the entire agreement clause was
drafted in the following terms:
The parties agree that these terms and conditions (together with any other terms and conditions expressly
incorporated in the Contract) represent the entire agreement between the parties relating to the sale and
purchase of the Equipment and that no statement or representations made by either party have been relied
upon by the other in agreeing to enter into the Contract.
The addition of the words ‘and that no statement or representations made by either
party have been relied upon by the other in agreeing to enter into the Contract’ were
inserted in order to exclude liability for misrepresentation. Clear words are required in
order to exclude liability for misrepresentation (
Axa Sun Life Services plc
 
v. 
Campbell
Martin Ltd
 
[2011] EWCA Civ 133, [2011] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 1), although whether the words
are effective so to exclude liability depends upon an evaluation of the words which have
been used in the particular clause (see 
17.6
) and any such attempt to exclude liability for
misrepresentation is likely to be caught by section 3 of the Misrepresentation Act 1967
and subject to a test of reasonableness (
First Tower Trustees Ltd
 
v. 
CDS (Superstores
International) Ltd
 
[2018] EWCA Civ 1396, [2019] 1 WLR 637, see 
17.6
). The modern
practice of inserting entire agreement clauses into contracts is in many ways a reaction
to the relaxation of the parol evidence rule (on which see 
8.4
).
12.3.11
 
No Oral Modification Clauses
No oral modification clauses are sometimes combined with entire agreement clauses (an
example being the final sentence of the entire agreement clause in 
Deepak Fertilisers
and Petrochemicals Corporation
 
v. 
ICI Chemicals & Polymers Ltd
 
[1999] 1 Lloyd’s Rep
387, 
see 
12.3.10
). The difference between the two is that an entire agreement clause
seeks to deny effect to promises or statements made prior to entry into the contract and
which are not to be found in the written terms of the contract, whereas a no oral
modification clause looks to the future and to the way in which the contract which the
parties have concluded can be amended or varied. The leading authority on the validity
and effect of a no oral modification clause is the decision of the Supreme Court in 
Rock
Advertising Ltd v MWB Business Exchange Centres Ltd
 
[2018] UKSC 24, [2019] AC
119, where the clause which was the focus of dispute was in the following terms:
All variations to this licence must be agreed, set out in writing and signed on behalf of both parties before they
take effect.
It can be seen that the aim of a clause of this nature is to provide the parties with
certainty as to the future shape or scope of their contract so that they always have a
written record of its content. The Supreme Court held that the effect of the clause was to
deprive an oral variation agreed between the parties of legal effect because it had not
complied with the formality prescribed by the clause. The decision has the merit of
giving effect to the clause as agreed by the parties. The criticism which has been levelled
against the decision is that it does not give effect to the last agreement made by the
parties and it will create practical difficulties in the case where the parties have acted in
reliance on the validity of the non-compliant variation. The latter difficulty may,
however, be mitigated by the operation of the doctrine of estoppel, at least in the case
where the parties have entered into the oral variation after one party has represented to
the other that no reliance will be placed on the no oral modification clause. Otherwise,
contracting parties who include a no oral modification clause in their contract should
have confidence that the courts will give effect to the clause and deny validity to a non-
compliant variation or amendment.
12.3.12
 
Termination Clauses
Contracting parties frequently produce standard form termination clauses which they
insert into their contracts. Termination tends to be seen as an important right (or, if one
prefers, remedy) in English contract law. The drafting of termination clauses can be a
difficult matter (for an example see 
Rice (t/a Garden Guardian)
 
v. 
Great Yarmouth
Borough Council
 
[2003] TCLR 1 CA, at 
22.3.5
). We shall examine termination clauses in
more detail in a subsequent chapter (see 
22.3.5
).
12.3.13
 
Assignment
The law allows parties, within prescribed limits, to assign their rights under the contract
to another party. Standard terms of contract frequently regulate the entitlement of
contracting parties to assign their rights. For example, clause 17(1) of the contract
between the parties in 
Linden Gardens Trust Ltd
 
v. 
Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd
[1994] 1 AC 85 provided:
The Employer shall not without the written consent of the Contractor assign this Contract.
This clause is, in fact, drafted rather loosely in that it is the rights under the contract that
are assigned and not the contract itself (see further 
25.3.3.3
). But the House of Lords
nevertheless gave effect to the clause and held that an attempted assignment of
contractual rights in breach of the prohibition contained in clause 17 was ineffective to
transfer any such contractual rights to the assignee (although a clause prohibiting
assignment may not necessarily prohibit a declaration of trust in favour of a third party:
Don King Productions Inc
 
v. 
Warren
 
[2000] Ch 291).
12.3.14
 
Exclusion and Limitation Clauses
Exclusion and limitation clauses are both extremely important boilerplate clauses and
they constitute the subject matter of the next chapter.

Exclusion Clauses
Central Issues
One of the most contentious boilerplate clauses in practice is an
exclusion or limitation clause. This is particularly so in relation to
liability for consequential losses. These losses can be enormous.
Contracting parties generally wish both to contain and to control that
risk. The clause that is generally used for this purpose is an exclusion
or limitation clause (in this chapter the general term ‘exclusion clause’
will be used to refer to both exclusion and limitation clauses unless it
is necessary to draw a distinction between an exclusion clause and a
limitation clause in relation to the matter that is under discussion).
In order to perform its function an exclusion or limitation clause must
(i) be validly incorporated into the contract, (ii) cover the loss which
has been suffered, and (iii) survive scrutiny under the Unfair Contract
Terms Act 1977, where that Act is applicable.
An exclusion or limitation clause must be drafted in clear terms if it is
to be effective. In the past the courts interpreted exclusion clauses
particularly strictly. The modern approach is to subject exclusion
clauses to the ordinary rules of interpretation but it remains necessary
for a lawyer drafting an exclusion clause to proceed with caution
because remnants of the old restrictive rules remain.
The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, despite its rather misleading title,
does not apply to all unfair terms in contracts. It applies to exclusion
and limitation clauses.
Two fundamental issues arise when seeking to apply the 1977 Act to a
contract term. The first may be termed a jurisdictional question, that is
to say whether the Act applies to the term at all. Thus the court may be
asked whether the clause is truly an exclusion clause or whether it is a
clause that simply defines the obligations of the parties but does not
purport to exclude liability for breach of an obligation. The second
issue relates to the type of control that is applicable under the Act.
Where the Act declares that the term is void no particular difficulty
arises. On the other hand, where the clause is subject to the
reasonableness test, then it can be a difficult matter to decide whether
or not a term satisfies that test.
13.1
 
Introduction
Exclusion clauses can be portrayed as a social nuisance on the basis that they are a
means by which contracting parties can seek to avoid the consequences of their failure
to perform their contractual obligations. In this sense exclusion clauses provided an easy
means by which a powerful party could exempt itself from any liability towards its
contracting party. This was particularly so in relation to consumers. The infamous ticket
cases in the late nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth century (see, for
example, 
Parker
 
v. 
South Eastern Railway
 
(1877) 2 CPD 416, at 
9.3
) demonstrated the
willingness of business enterprises to make use of sweeping exemption clauses in their
dealings with consumers. The problems presented by big business systematically
excluding liability towards consumers continued well into the twentieth century, as can
be demonstrated by cases such as 
McCutcheon
 
v. 
David MacBrayne Ltd
 
[1964] 1 WLR
125 (see 
9.3
) and 
Thornton
 
v. 
Shoe Lane Parking Ltd
 
[1971] 2 QB 163 (see 
9.3
). It is,
however, a mistake to see exclusion and limitation clauses entirely in this negative light.
They can play an important (and positive) role in the regulation of risk.
An example of the role played by exclusion clauses in the regulation of risk is provided
by the case of 
British Fermentation Products Ltd
 
v. 
Compair Reavell Ltd
 
[1999] BLR
352. The defendant sellers agreed to supply and install a centrifugal air compressor at
the purchaser’s premises. The contract price was ‘a little under £300,000’. The
purchasers alleged that the compressor did not perform to its contractually agreed level.
Further, they alleged that, while the sellers had attempted to remedy the fault, they had
been unable to do so and that, in consequence, they had suffered loss. That loss took the
form of increased operating costs for the life of the machine of £1,168,584 and also loss
of capacity and/or downtime. Here it can be seen that the consequential losses were
almost four times the size of the contract price. Some businesses cannot afford to bear
that type of loss and so rely on exclusion or limitation clauses in order to contain their
potential liability. The defence of the sellers in 
British Fermentation Products
 
depended
upon the relationship between three clauses in the contract. The first was condition 4
which made provision for the testing of the compressor and stated that, if the
compressor failed to pass the test, the purchaser was entitled ‘by notice in writing to
reject the goods or such part thereof as shall have failed’ the test. Secondly, condition 5
gave to the purchasers the right to replace goods which were rejected and, in such a case,
the defendants agreed to pay to the purchasers ‘any sum by which the expenditure
reasonably incurred by the Purchaser in replacing the rejected goods exceeds the sum
deducted’ in order to reflect the value of the rejected goods. The claimants decided not
to exercise their rights under either condition 4 or condition 5. The third clause relied
upon by the defendants was condition 11 which stated:
The vendor’s liability under this condition or under condition 5 (Rejection and Replacement) shall be accepted
by the Purchaser in lieu of any warranty or condition implied by law as to the quality or fitness for any
particular purpose of the goods and save as provided in this condition the vendor shall not be under any liability
to the Purchaser (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for any defects in the goods or for any damage, loss,
death or injury (other than death or personal injury caused by the negligence of the vendor as defined in section
1 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977) resulting from such defects or from any work done in connection
therewith.
Judge Bowsher QC held that this clause was effective to exclude the vendors’ liability to
the purchasers. In reaching this conclusion Judge Bowsher was heavily influenced by his
perception of the commercial purpose of condition 11 seen in the context of the contract
as a whole. He stated (at p. 358):
It seems to me that the business common sense intention of the agreement as a whole is that the vendors
undertake to supply a machine of the specification warranted, and if they fail in that undertaking the purchasers
have an initial right to withdraw from the contract and reject the machine on terms that the vendors pay for
them to buy from other suppliers a machine that is up to specification. If the purchasers so choose, there will be
a period when the vendors will try to bring the machine up to specification, and those efforts again may be
terminated by the purchasers by rejecting on the same agreed terms. If the purchasers still do not reject when
the machine fails to come up to specification, the purchasers keep the machine but on terms that they do not
complain thereafter of the failure to come up to specification. The amount of the damages claimed in this action
compared with the purchase price shows the good business common sense of the contract. If the project is not
successful, the purchasers have two opportunities to withdraw and buy a substitute machine of the standard
warranted from another supplier at the vendor’s expense, but they are not to be allowed to stand on the deal
and charge the vendors enormous sums for their loss continuing for the life of the machine.
In the light of cases such as 
British Fermentation Products
 
it is difficult to defend the
view that exclusion clauses do not have a legitimate role to play in modern contract law.
They clearly do play an important and valuable role in regulating and containing risk.
The difficulty lies in determining when they perform a legitimate function and when
they do not. In other words, exclusion and limitation clauses need to be regulated, not
outlawed.
The nature of this regulation has changed over time. Prior to the enactment of the
Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 the courts did not have the power, at common law, to
invalidate an exclusion or limitation clause on the ground that it was unreasonable. Lord
Denning did attempt to formulate such a jurisdiction but his attempts in this regard
were firmly rejected by the House of Lords. In the absence of a direct power to regulate
unreasonable exclusion clauses the courts resorted to indirect means. The principal
indirect means were the rules relating to the incorporation and interpretation of
exclusion clauses. In cases such as 
J Spurling Ltd
 
v. 
Bradshaw
 
[1956] 1 WLR 461 (see
9.3
) and 
Thornton
 
v. 
Shoe Lane Parking Ltd
 
[1971] 2 QB 163 (see 
9.3
) the courts were
able in effect to regulate an unreasonable exclusion clause by concluding that it had not
been incorporated into the contract. The other device which the courts used was to apply
to exclusion clauses particularly restrictive rules of interpretation so as to enable them
to conclude that the clause did not in fact exempt the defendant from the particular loss
that the plaintiff had suffered. Now that the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 has been
enacted, the need for these indirect methods of control has largely disappeared. The Act
can now do the job. While there are signs in the case-law that these old restrictive rules
are on the way out (see, for example, 
Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA
 
v.
Ali
 
[2001] UKHL 8, [2002] 1 AC 251) it cannot be said that they have disappeared (see,
for example, 
AEG (UK) Ltd
 
v. 
Logic Resource Ltd
 
[1996] CLC 265, see 
9.3
). The law is
currently in a state of transition. The status of some of the old cases, which adopt a
restrictive approach to the interpretation of exclusion clauses, is presently uncertain.
A contracting party which wishes to rely on an exclusion or limitation clause in order to
exclude or limit its liability towards its contracting party must prove two matters and
may 
be subject to challenge on a third issue. The first matter which the party relying on
the exclusion clause must prove is that the clause has been validly incorporated into the
contract. Incorporation has been discussed in 
Chapter 9
. It is not necessary to go over
this ground again. It suffices to note that many (but not all) of the cases discussed in
Chapter 9
 
are cases concerned with the incorporation of exclusion clauses into a
contract and that the courts have often been reluctant to conclude that an exclusion
clause has been so incorporated. Exclusion clauses may be regarded as ‘onerous’ or
‘unusual’ and so attract the more stringent rules relating to the incorporation of terms
into a contract (see generally 
Interfoto Picture Library Ltd
 
v. 
Stiletto Visual
Programmes Ltd
 
[1989] QB 433, see 
9.3
). But this is by no means a necessary inference.
The mere fact that the clause in question is a limitation or exclusion clause does not of
itself mean that it is onerous or unusual (
Goodlife Foods Ltd
 
v. 
Hall Fire Protection Ltd
[2018] EWCA Civ 1371, [2018] BLR 491, [35]). So, for example, a clause which limited
the contractor’s liability at a maximum of the contract price was held not to be ‘onerous’
or ‘unusual’ (see, for example, 
Shepherd Homes Ltd
 
v. 
Encia Remediation Ltd
 
[2007]
EWHC 70 (TCC), [2007] BLR 135).
The second matter which a party relying upon an exclusion clause must prove is that the
exclusion clause, as a matter of construction, is effective to exclude liability for the loss
that the claimant has suffered. The principles applied by the courts when interpreting
contract terms have been discussed in 
Chapter 11
 
but it is necessary here to examine
some of the particular principles of interpretation that have been formulated in the
context of cases concerned with the interpretation of exclusion clauses. The future of
these principles is a matter of some doubt. But it cannot yet be said that they have
disappeared.
The third matter relates to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. A party relying on an
exclusion clause does not have to prove that the clause is valid under the Act. It is for the
party challenging the validity of the clause to prove that it falls within its scope but, once
he does so, the onus of proof switches to the party relying upon the clause to prove that
it is reasonable (at least in those cases in which the clause is subject to the
reasonableness test).
13.2
 
Interpretation
In the past the courts applied extremely restrictive rules to the interpretation of
exclusion and limitation clauses. That restrictive approach was perhaps best expressed
by Lord Denning in 
George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd
 
v. 
Finney Lock Seeds Ltd
 
[1983]
QB 284, 296–297:
None of you nowadays will remember the trouble we had—when I was called to the Bar—with exemption
clauses. They were printed in small print on the back of tickets and order forms and invoices. They were
contained in catalogues or timetables. They were held to be binding on any person who took them without
objection. No one ever did object. He never read them or knew what was in them. No matter how unreasonable
they were, he was bound. All this was done in the name of ‘freedom of contract’. But the freedom was all on the
side of the big concern which had the use of the printing press. No freedom for the little man who took the ticket
or order form or invoice. The big concern said, ‘Take it or leave it’. The little man had no option but to take it.
The big concern could and did exempt itself from liability in its own interest without regard to the little man. It
got away with it time after time. When the courts said to the big concern, ‘You must put it in clear words’, the
big concern had no hesitation in doing so. It knew well that the little man would never read the exemption
clauses or understand them …
Faced with this abuse of power—by the strong against the weak—by the use of the small print of the
conditions—the judges did what they could to put a curb upon it. They still had before them the idol, ‘freedom of
contract’. They still knelt down and worshipped it, but they concealed under their cloaks a secret weapon. They
used it to stab the idol in the back. This weapon was called ‘the true construction of the contract’. They used it
with great skill and ingenuity. They used it so as to depart from the natural meaning of the words of the
exemption clause and to put upon them a strained and unnatural construction. In case after case, they said that
the words were not strong enough to give the big concern exemption from liability; or that in the circumstances
the big concern was not entitled to rely on the exemption clause. If a ship deviated from the contractual voyage,
the owner could not rely on the exemption clause. If a warehouseman stored the goods in the wrong warehouse,
he could not pray in aid the limitation clause. If the seller supplied goods different in kind from those
contracted for, he could not rely on any exemption from liability. If a shipowner delivered goods to a person
without production of the bill of lading, he could not escape responsibility by reference to an exemption clause.
In short, whenever the wide words—in their natural meaning—would give rise to an unreasonable result, the
judges either rejected them as repugnant to the main purpose of the contract, or else cut them down to size in
order to produce a reasonable result.
In the same judgment, however, Lord Denning acknowledged that the need for these
restrictive rules had largely, if not entirely, disappeared as a result of the enactment of
the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and he observed that the courts ‘should no longer
have to go through all kinds of gymnastic contortions to get round them’.
The approach of the modern courts is a much more straightforward one which applies to
exclusion and limitation clauses the same principles as would be applied to any other
term of the contract (on which see 
Chapter 11
), subject to the requirement that clear
words are needed if one party is effectively to restrict or take away from the other party a
valuable right. This approach was summarized by Lord Leggatt (in a judgment with
which Lord Burrows agreed) in 
Triple Point Technology Inc
 
v. 
PTT Public Co Ltd
 
[2021]
UKSC 29, [2021] 3 WLR 521, [107]–[111] in the following terms:
107. The approach of the courts to the interpretation of exclusion clauses (including clauses limiting liability) in
commercial contracts has changed markedly in the last 50 years. Two forces have been at work. One has been
the impact of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, which provided a direct means of controlling unreasonable
exclusion clauses and removed the need for courts to resort to artificial rules of interpretation to get around
them: see Lord Denning’s swansong in 
George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd
 
v. 
Finney Lock Seeds Ltd
 
[1983] QB
284, 296–301; and 
Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA
 
v. 
Ali
 
[2001] UKHL 8; [2002] 1 AC 251,
paras 57–60 (Lord Hoffmann). This change of attitude was heralded by the decision of the House of Lords in
Photo Production Ltd
 
v. 
Securicor Transport Ltd
 
[1980] AC 827. The second force has been the development of
the modern approach in English law to contractual interpretation, with its emphasis on context and objective
meaning and deprecation of special ‘rules’ of interpretation—encapsulated by Lord Hoffmann’s announcement
in 
Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd
 
v. 
West Bromwich Building Society
 
[1998] 1 WLR 896 at 912 that
‘almost all the old intellectual baggage of “legal” interpretation has been discarded’.
108.
 
The modern view is accordingly to recognise that commercial parties are free to make their own
bargains and allocate risks as they think fit, and that the task of the court is to interpret the words used fairly
applying the ordinary methods of contractual interpretation. It also remains necessary, however, to recognise
that a vital part of the setting in which parties 
contract is a framework of rights and obligations established by
the common law (and often now codified in statute). These comprise duties imposed by the law of tort and also
norms of commerce which have come to be recognised as ordinary incidents of particular types of contract or
relationship and which often take the form of terms implied in the contract by law. Although its strength will
vary according to the circumstances of the case, the court in construing the contract starts from the assumption
that in the absence of clear words the parties did not intend the contract to derogate from these normal rights
and obligations.
109.
 
The first and still perhaps the leading statement of this principle is that in 
Modern Engineering
(Bristol) Ltd
 
v. 
Gilbert-Ash (Northern) Ltd
 
[1974] AC 689 (‘
Gilbert-Ash
’) ….
111.
 
To the extent that the process has not been completed already, old and outmoded formulas such as the
three-limb test in 
Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v The King
 
[1952] AC 192, 208, and the ‘contra proferentem’
rule are steadily losing their last vestiges of independent authority and being subsumed within the wider
Gilbert-Ash
 
principle. As Andrew Burrows QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, said in 
Federal Republic
of Nigeria v JP Morgan Chase Bank NA
 
[2019] EWHC 347 (Comm); [2019] 1 CLC 207, para 34(iii):
‘Applying the modern approach, the force of what was the 
contra proferentem
 
rule is embraced by
recognising that a party is unlikely to have agreed to give up a valuable right that it would otherwise have had
without clear words. And as Moore-Bick LJ put it in the 
Stocznia
 
case, at para 23, ‘The more valuable the right,
the clearer the language will need to be’. So, for example, clear words will generally be needed before a court will
conclude that the agreement excludes a party’s liability for its own negligence.’
Three points should be noted in relation to Lord Leggatt’s analysis of the development of
the law. First, he notes at ([111]) that the ‘contra proferentem rule’ is losing its authority.
The contra proferentem rule was (and perhaps still is) a rule of general application in
the law of contract (see 
Tan Wing Chuen
 
v. 
Bank of Credit and Commerce Hong Kong
Ltd
 
[1996] 2 BCLC 69, 77) according to which, in the event of there being an ambiguity
in a contract term, the ambiguity was to be resolved against the party relying upon the
term. This rule was applied to exclusion clauses with particular venom by the courts to
such an extent that, in some cases, the courts appeared to apply the rule in such a way as
to create an ambiguity which did not in truth exist in order to apply the rule (see, for
example, 
Wallis, Son and Wells
 
v. 
Pratt and Haynes
 
[1911] AC 394 and 
Andrews Bros
(Bournemouth) Ltd
 
v. 
Singer and Co Ltd
 
[1934] 1 KB 17). A modern court would not
take such an approach, particularly in the case of a commercial contract negotiated
between parties of equal bargaining power (see 
Persimmon Homes Ltd
 
v. 
Ove Arup &
Partners Ltd
 
[2017] EWCA Civ 373, [2017] BLR 417, [52] and 
Transocean Drilling UK
Ltd
 
v. 
Providence Resources plc
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 372, [2016] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 51, [20]).
Given these developments Lord Leggatt would appear to be correct in concluding that
the contra proferentem rule, to the extent that it still exists, is of much reduced
significance in the modern law.
Secondly, the wider principle identified by Lord Leggatt is that the courts will look for
‘clear words’ before reaching the conclusion that one party has agreed to give up a
valuable right that it would otherwise have had. It may be said that the ‘clear words rule’
may not be very different in effect from the contra proferentem rule in that both will give
effect to an exclusion clause where clear words are used but not when it is ambiguously
expressed. While there is force in this point, there are two advantages to the modern
approach. The first is that it avoids the need to identify the ‘proferens’. This was a point
of potential difficulty with the contra proferentem rule, at least in the case where the
contract was the subject of genuine negotiation between the parties. In such a case,
given that the clause was the product of 
negotiation between the parties, who is the
proferens? No such difficulty arises in the case of the ‘clear words rule’ because in order
to apply the rule, all that the court needs to do is to identify the party whose rights have
been said to have been taken away. The second advantage is that the rule is much easier
for contracting parties to understand given its succinct description of the applicable
principle.
The third point to note about Lord Leggatt’s judgment is his description (at [110]) of the
(1)
(2)
‘normal rights and obligations’ the deprivation of which will which attract the operation
of the rule. At the margins, it may not be entirely easy to identify what is a ‘valuable’ or a
‘normal’ right that will trigger the operation of the rule but any uncertainty here should
not give rise to undue difficulty given that one would ordinarily expect a contract term to
be drafted clearly. So in requiring that clear words be used, the courts are doing no more
than insisting on what would otherwise be good drafting practice. The cases that are
most likely to attract the ‘clear words rule’ are cases in which one party claims that it has
effectively excluded liability in respect of its own failure to take reasonable care in the
performance of its contractual obligations and in the case where it is said that the breach
encompasses a breach of a fundamental term of the contract or the breach a core
incident of a particular type of contract or relationship. It is to these cases that we now
turn before, finally in the context of our consideration of the interpretation of exclusion
and limitation clauses, examining the approach which the courts take towards the
interpretation of limitation clauses and clauses which seek to exclude liability for
‘indirect or consequential loss’.
13.2.1
 
Excluding Liability in Negligence
In his judgment in 
Triple Point
, Lord Leggatt refers to the ‘three-limb test in 
Canada
Steamship Lines Ltd
 
v. 
The
 
King’ as an authority which is ‘steadily losing [its] last
vestiges of independent authority.’ 
Canada Steamship Lines Ltd
 
v. 
The King
 
[1952] AC
192 was for many years the leading authority on the exclusion or limitation of liability in
negligence. The word ‘negligence’ in an exclusion or limitation clause will ordinarily
encompass liability arising in the tort of negligence and liability which flows from the
breach of a contractual duty to exercise reasonable care and skill (
Triple Point
Technology Inc
 
v. 
PTT Public Co Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 29, [2021] 3 WLR 521, [52] and
[100]). The three-limb test to which Lord Leggatt refers was set out by Lord Morton of
Henryton in 
Canada Steamship
 
in the following terms (at p 208):
Their Lordships think that the duty of a court in approaching the consideration of such clauses may be
summarized as follows:–
If the clause contains language which expressly exempts the person in whose favour it is made (hereafter
called ‘the proferens’) from the consequence of the negligence of his own servants, effect must be given
to that provision …
If there is no express reference to negligence, the court must consider whether the words used are wide
enough, in their ordinary meaning, to cover negligence on the part of the servants of the proferens. If a
(3)
doubt arises at this point, it must be resolved against the proferens …
If the words used are wide enough for the above purpose, the court must then consider whether ‘the
head of damage may be based on some ground other than that of 
negligence’, to quote again Lord
Greene in the 
Alderslade
 
case [1945] KB 189, 192. The ‘other ground’ must not be so fanciful or remote
that the proferens cannot be supposed to have desired protection against it; but subject to this
qualification, which is no doubt to be implied from Lord Greene’s words, the existence of a possible head
of damage other than that of negligence is fatal to the proferens even if the words used are prima facie
wide enough to cover negligence on the part of his servants.
Why did Lord Leggatt conclude that these tests are steadily losing their last vestiges of
independent authority? The first limb of the test is not a source of difficulty and it is
entirely consistent with the requirement that ‘clear words’ be used if liability in
negligence is to be effectively excluded. If a clause ‘expressly exempts’ a party from the
consequences of his or his employees’ negligence then the clause is effective, as a matter
of interpretation, to exclude liability for negligence. In order to constitute an express
reference to negligence it does not suffice for a party to use general words such as ‘loss
however caused’ or ‘damage howsoever arising’. The word ‘negligence’ or a synonym for
negligence (such as carelessness) must be used (see 
Shell Chemicals UK Ltd
 
v. 
P & O
Roadtanks Ltd
 
[1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 297, 301).
The problem lies with the second and the third principles and it is suggested that it is
these principles that are the object of Lord Leggatt’s concern, a point which can be
demonstrated by the way in which the courts have approached these two principles in
recent years. The difficulty with these two principles is that they rest on the dubious
assumption that parties do not intend to use general words such as ‘loss howsoever
caused’ to cover both negligently inflicted loss and non-negligently inflicted loss. One
would have thought that the natural inference to be drawn from the use of such general
words is that the precise cause of the loss is irrelevant so that the clause is apt to
encompass loss whether or not it is caused by negligence. But this is not the approach
taken by the courts. According to the third principle, general words will only be effective
to exclude liability for negligently inflicted loss in the case where the only realistic loss
likely to be suffered by the claimant is loss suffered as a result of the negligence of the
defendants. Where there is a realistic possibility that the defendant might be liable to
the claimant either in negligence or on some other basis then the scope of the exclusion
clause will generally be confined to the non-negligent source of liability and leave the
defendant with no protection at all in the event that the claimant suffers loss as a result
of the negligence of the defendant.
The basic flaw in the 
Canada Steamship
 
rules is the assumption that contracting parties
do not intend to use general words of exclusion to cover both negligently inflicted loss
and non-negligently inflicted loss. This ‘assumption’ does not take the form of a rule of
law. As Salmon LJ stated in 
Hollier
 
v. 
Rambler Motors (AMC) Ltd
 
[1972] 2 QB 71, 80
‘rules of construction are merely our guides and not our masters’. It is therefore open to
a court to conclude that a clause is effective to exclude liability for negligence under the
third limb of 
Canada Steamship
 
notwithstanding the fact that it was possible to
envisage some other possible source of liability to which the clause might potentially
apply (see 
The Raphael
 
[1982] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 42). But the more realistic the alternative
source of liability, the less likely it is that the court will conclude that general words are
effective to exclude liability for negligently inflicted loss (see 
EE Caledonia Ltd
 
v. 
Orbit
Valve Co Europe
 
[1994] 1 WLR 1515).
The influence of the 
Canada Steamship
 
rules or principles has, however, gradually
waned over time as the courts have emphasized that their paramount task is to give
effect to the 
intention of the parties. This is perhaps best expressed in the judgment of
Lord Bingham in 
HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd
 
v. 
Chase Manhattan Bank
[2003] UKHL 6, [2003] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 61, [11] when he stated:
There can be no doubting the general authority of [Lord Morton’s principles], which have been applied in many
cases, and the approach indicated is sound. The courts should not ordinarily infer that a contracting party has
given up rights which the law confers upon him to an extent greater than the contract terms indicate he has
chosen to do; and if the contract terms can take legal and practical effect without denying him the rights he
would ordinarily enjoy if the other party is negligent, they will be read as not denying him those rights unless
they are so expressed as to make clear that they do.
The word ‘ordinarily’ is important here. We are not dealing with rules of law which must
be rigidly applied. As the Court of Appeal observed in 
Mir Steel UK Ltd
 
v. 
Morris
 
[2012]
EWCA Civ 1397, [2013] 2 All ER (Comm) 54, [35] the 
Canada Steamship
 
principles
‘should not be applied mechanistically and ought to be regarded as no more than
guidelines’. In particular, they do not provide an ‘automatic solution’ to a particular
case. Thus, where it is clear that the parties have used general words such as ‘any claim’
to encompass a claim brought in negligence, then effect must be given to their intention
and the 
Canada Steamship
 
guidelines should not be applied in such a way as to
frustrate that intention.
The latter point is illustrated by the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Greenwich
Millennium Village Ltd
 
v. 
Essex Services Group plc
 
[2014] EWCA Civ 960, [2014] 1
WLR 3517, where a party who had failed to detect a defect in work done by its
contracting party was held to be entitled to claim an indemnity from that party. This was
so notwithstanding the fact that the party claiming the indemnity had been negligent in
the discharge of its duty to its contracting party. But, as between the parties to the
contract containing the indemnity clause, the negligence of the party claiming the
indemnity had been ‘passive’ (that is to say, it had failed to notice the defect) whereas
the negligence of the party from whom the indemnity was claimed had been ‘active’ (that
is to say it was its actions which had caused the loss in respect of which the claim had
been brought). This being the case, the claimant was held to be entitled to bring a claim
under the indemnity notwithstanding the lack of an express reference in the clause to
‘negligence’. The construction adopted was held to be consistent with the intention of
the parties in that it enabled liability to flow down the chain of contracts until it rested
with the party whose active negligence had been responsible for the losses that had been
suffered. However, had the negligence of the party claiming the indemnity been ‘active’,
a court would have been less likely to conclude that it was effective to encompass
negligence. The latter point was made clear by the Court of Appeal in 
Persimmon
Homes Ltd
 
v. 
Ove Arup & Partners Ltd
 
[2017] EWCA Civ 373, [2017] BLR 417, [56],
where Jackson LJ stated that the 
Canada Steamship
 
guidelines were now ‘more
relevant’ to indemnity clauses than to exclusion clauses on the basis that ‘it is one thing
to agree that A is not liable to B for the consequences of A’s negligence’ but it is ‘quite
another thing to agree that B must compensate A for the consequences of A’s own
negligence’. Thus it may be that in future the 
Canada Steamship
 
rules or principles will
have greater application to indemnity clauses, at least in cases of ‘active’ negligence by
the party claiming the indemnity and have rather less by way of application to attempts
to exclude liability for negligence, at least where the parties to the contract are both
commercial entities capable of looking after their own interests.
On the basis of the more recent case-law, Lord Morton’s rules may express no more than
a judicial reluctance to conclude that one party has agreed to exempt the other party
from the consequences of his negligence (
Colour Quest Ltd
 
v. 
Total Downstream UK plc
[2009] EWHC 540 (Comm), [2009] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 1, [369]), although this reluctance
does not manifest itself with the same vigour in the case where the clause seeks to limit
(rather than exclude) liability for negligently inflicted harm (
Biffa Waste Services Ltd
 
v.
Maschinenfabrik Ernst Hese GmbH
 
[2008] EWHC 6 (TCC), [2008] BLR 155, [188]).
This reluctance is understandable but it does not justify the 
Canada Steamship
 
rules, in
particular the operation of the second and the third rules. It is therefore suggested that
Lord Leggatt is correct to state that these rules should be discarded and replaced by a
rule that requires that clear words be used if liability in negligence is to be effectively
excluded. On this basis, where the clause expressly excludes liability in ‘negligence’ then,
subject to the operation of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (on which see 
13.3
), effect
should be given to the clause. Further, the use of words such as loss ‘howsoever caused’
or ‘howsoever arising’ should ordinarily be effective to exclude liability in negligence.
13.2.2
 
Fundamental Breach
A classic illustration of the traditional, restrictive approach to the interpretation of
exclusion and limitation clauses, although not directly referred to by Lord Leggatt in
Triple Point
, is the doctrine of fundamental breach which gave rise to a considerable
amount of difficulty in the 1960s and 1970s. It was, essentially, a device that was used by
the courts in order to control unreasonable exclusion clauses before they were given
statutory jurisdiction to do so in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. The principal
architect of the doctrine was Lord Denning. In 
Harbutt’s Plasticine Ltd
 
v. 
Wayne Tank
and Pump Co Ltd
 
[1970] 1 QB 447, 467 Lord Denning MR stated:
[W]hen one party has been guilty of a fundamental breach of the contract, that is, a breach which goes to the
very root of it, and the other side accepts it, so that the contract comes to an end—or if it comes to an end
anyway by reason of the breach—then the guilty party cannot rely on an exemption or limitation clause to
escape from his liability for the breach.
The importance of this statement lies in the assertion that, as a matter of law, a party
cannot rely on an exclusion or limitation clause where he has committed a fundamental
breach of the contract. In making this statement Lord Denning was purporting to
summarize the decision of the House of Lords in 
Suisse Atlantique Société d’Armement
Maritime SA
 
v. 
NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale
 
[1967] 1 AC 361. His summary was
demonstrably faulty. The House of Lords in 
Suisse Atlantique
 
laid down no such rule. It
is admittedly not entirely easy to extract a clear ratio from the lengthy judgments of the
House of Lords in that case but it is tolerably clear that their conclusion was that
fundamental breach was a rule of construction not a rule of law. In other words, it was a
rule that stated, the more serious the breach, the clearer the words that have to be used
in order to exclude liability for the breach. This reflects the ordinary, common-sense
perception that one party is unlikely to agree that the other party can breach the
contract in a fundamental respect without incurring any liability for doing so. The
House of Lords did not state that, as a matter of law, one party cannot exclude or limit
liability for a fundamental breach of contract.
That this was so was confirmed by the House of Lords in 
Photo Production Ltd
 
v.
Securicor Transport Ltd
 
[1980] AC 827. The House of Lords overruled 
Harbutt’s
Plasticine
 
and held that the question whether or not an exclusion or limitation clause is
effective to exclude or limit liability is, in all cases, a question of construction. In doing
so, their Lordships did not deny that Lord Denning’s version of fundamental breach had
performed a useful function in the past, but they concluded that it was no longer
necessary in the light of the enactment of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. Thus
Lord Wilberforce acknowledged (at p. 843) that the ‘doctrine of “fundamental breach” in
spite of its imperfections and doubtful parentage [had] served a useful purpose’ but
went on to state that there was no longer any need for the doctrine in the light of the
enactment of the Unfair Contract Terms Act.
In 
George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd
 
v. 
Finney Lock Seeds Ltd
 
[1983] 2 AC 803 Lord
Bridge stated (at p. 813) that 
Photo Production
 
‘gave the final quietus to the doctrine
that a “fundamental breach” of contract deprived the party in breach of the benefit of
clauses in the contract excluding or limiting his liability’. Further, as Neill LJ stated in
Edmund Murray Ltd
 
v. 
BSP International Foundations Ltd
 
(1993) 33 Con LR 1, 16:
[I]t is always necessary when considering an exemption clause to decide whether as a matter of construction it
extends to exclude or restrict the liability in question, but, if it does, it is no longer permissible at common law
to reject or circumvent the clause by treating it as inapplicable to ‘a fundamental breach’.
It is therefore clear that fundamental breach no longer exists as a rule of law and, in so
far as it may be said to reflect the approach which the courts take towards the
interpretation of exclusion clauses, it is now probably best explained by reference to the
‘clear words’ rule. Thus in 
Mott Macdonald Ltd
 
v. 
Trant Engineering Ltd
 
[2021] EWHC
754 (TCC), [2021] BLR 440 it was held that an exclusion clause in a contract
encompassed breaches of contract that were ‘fundamental, deliberate, or wilful’ because
of the clear terms in which the clause had been drafted. In so concluding Judge Eyre QC
confirmed (at [64]) that exclusion clauses, including those purporting to exclude or limit
liability for deliberate and repudiatory breaches of contract, are to be construed by
reference to ‘the normal principles of contractual construction without the imposition of
a presumption [against the clause extending to such breaches] and without requiring
any particular form of words or level of language to achieve the effect of excluding
liability’. However, he also added that these normal principles of contractual
interpretation include the need for the use of clear words as he continued by observing
(at [65]) that in cases of fundamental breach ‘it will be inherently less likely than
otherwise that a clause was intended to operate to exclude liability unless it is clear from
the language when properly interpreted in context that it has that effect’. In this way the
old rules or presumptions in relation to fundamental breach can be seen to have been
subsumed within the wider ‘clear words’ rule, as set out by Lord Leggatt in 
Triple Point
,
and so it can be expected that the old learning on fundamental breach can be quietly laid
to rest now that its work is done by the ‘clear words’ rule.
13.2.3
 
Limitation Clauses
A third area which has given rise to some difficulty is the approach that the courts
should take towards the interpretation of limitation clauses. There is authority to the
effect that limitation clauses are not interpreted as restrictively as exclusion clauses. In
Ailsa Craig 
Fishing Co Ltd
 
v. 
Malvern Fishing Co Ltd
 
[1983] 1 WLR 964 Lord Fraser of
Tullybelton stated (at p. 970):
There are … authorities which lay down very strict principles to be applied when considering the effect of
clauses of exclusion or of indemnity … In my opinion these principles are not applicable in their full rigour
when considering the effect of clauses merely limiting liability. Such clauses will of course be read contra
proferentem and must be clearly expressed, but there is no reason why they should be judged by the specially
exacting standards which are applied to exclusion and indemnity clauses. The reason for imposing such
standards on these clauses is the inherent improbability that the other party to a contract including such a
clause intended to release the proferens from a liability that would otherwise fall upon him. But there is no such
high degree of improbability that he would agree to a limitation of the liability of the proferens, especially when
… the potential losses that might be caused by the negligence of the proferens or its servants are so great in
proportion to the sums that can reasonably be charged for the services contracted for. It is enough in the
present case that the clause must be clear and unambiguous.
The justification put forward in support of this difference in treatment between
exclusion clauses and limitation clauses is not particularly convincing. The
improbability of a party agreeing to an exclusion clause is not necessarily much greater
than the improbability of a party agreeing to a limitation clause. Much depends upon the
size of the limitation clause. A limitation clause of £1 is very similar to a total exclusion
of liability. In 
BHP Petroleum Ltd
 
v. 
British Steel plc
 
[2000] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 277 Evans LJ
stated (at p. 285):
I think it is unfortunate if the present authorities cannot be reconciled on the basis that no categorization is
necessary and of a general rule that the more extreme the consequences are, in terms of excluding or modifying
the liability which would otherwise arise, then the more stringent the Court’s approach should be in requiring
that the exclusion or limit should be clearly and unambiguously expressed. Indeed, if the requirement is of a
clear and unambiguous provision, then it is not easy to see why degrees of clarity and lack of unambiguity
should be recognized.
13.2.4
 
Indirect or Consequential Loss
A final point relating to the interpretation of exclusion and limitation clause relates to
the meaning of the phrase ‘indirect or consequential loss’. As has been noted (
13.1
),
claims for consequential losses can be enormous. This being the case, parties frequently
wish to exclude liability for consequential losses and they often do so by excluding
liability for ‘indirect or consequential loss’ in order to keep liability within acceptable
bounds. But what does this phrase mean? Its meaning has been considered by the Court
of Appeal on a number of occasions. One such case is 
Hotel Services Ltd
 
v. 
Hilton
International Hotels (UK) Ltd
 
[2000] BLR 235. The parties entered into a contract
under which the defendants agreed to supply the claimants with ‘Robobars’ for their
hotels. A ‘Robobar’ was a hotel minibar which automatically recorded any removal of its
contents and at the same time electronically registered the item concerned on the
account of the guest. The attraction for the claimants was the obvious one, namely that it
was hoped that it would reduce the incidence of theft from hotel minibars.
Unfortunately, 
the Robobars proved to be defective in that their chillers leaked
ammonia which corroded the equipment and also created a very small risk of injury to
guests in the hotel. The claimants therefore removed the Robobars from their hotels and
brought an action for damages against the defendants, in which they claimed the cost of
removal and storage of the chiller units and cabinets and their loss of profit on the
minibars. The defendants relied on an exclusion clause in the following terms:
The Company will not in any circumstances be liable for any indirect or consequential loss, damage or liability
arising from any defect in or failure of the System or any part thereof or the performance of this Agreement or
any breach hereof by the Company or its employees.
The issue before the Court of Appeal was whether or not this clause was effective to
exclude liability for the losses claimed by the claimants. The Court of Appeal held that it
was not. The important distinction that must be drawn in this context is between a
‘direct’ loss (which is outside the scope of the exclusion clause) and an ‘indirect’ loss
(which is within its scope). As a matter of authority the line between direct and indirect
or consequential losses is drawn along the boundary between the first and second limbs
of the rule in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
(1854) 9 Exch 341 (discussed in more detail at
23.8.1
). In other words, if the loss is such as may fairly and reasonably be considered as
arising naturally from the breach of contract (‘limb one’), it is a direct loss. On the other
hand, if the loss is such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the
contemplation of both parties at the time of entry into the contract (‘limb two’), it is an
indirect or consequential loss. Although the task of distinguishing between limb one of
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
and limb two is not always an easy one (see further 
23.8.1
), the
Court of Appeal did not experience any difficulty in applying it to the facts of the present
case. Thus Sedley LJ stated (at p. 241) that:
[W]e prefer … to decide this case … on the direct ground that if equipment rented out for selling drinks without
defalcations turns out to be unusable and possibly dangerous, it requires no special mutually known fact to
establish the immediacy both of the consequent cost of putting it where it can do no harm and—if when in use it
was showing a direct profit—of the consequent loss of profit. Such losses are not embraced by the exclusion
clause, read in its documentary and commercial context.
The loss of profit claim on the facts of the case amounted to £127,000, yet it was all held
to be a direct consequence of the breach and so not within scope of the exclusion clause.
The clause was only effective to exclude liability for losses of profit that were not direct
but were nevertheless recoverable because they were within the contemplation of both
parties at the time of entry into the contract (as in 
Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd
 
v.
Newman Industries Ltd
 
[1949] 2 KB 528, see 
23.8.1
). This being the case, a clause
which excludes liability for ‘indirect or consequential losses’ will provide very little
protection for a defendant because many sizeable loss of profit claims will fall within the
category of ‘direct’ rather than ‘indirect’ losses. If the intention of the defendant is to
exclude liability for loss of profits suffered by the claimant then the exclusion or
limitation clause should make express reference to the exclusion of loss of profit claims
and not rely on general words of uncertain scope, such as ‘indirect or consequential
loss’. That said, there may be some hope for defendants who rely on such clauses. In
Star Polaris LLC
 
v. 
HHIC-PHIL 
Inc
 
[2016] EWHC 2941 (Comm), [2017] 1 Lloyd’s Rep
203, Sir Jeremy Cooke held that arbitrators had been entitled to conclude that the word
‘consequential’ was used by the parties in its cause-and-effect sense and not in the sense
just outlined. Thus the equation of consequential losses with the second limb of 
Hadley
v. 
Baxendale
 
would appear not to be an inevitable one so that a court may be able to
depart from it where it is established on the evidence that the parties did not intend to
use the phrase in this sense and they can point to terms in the contract which can only
be consistent with the term being given a wider meaning. Further, in 
Caledonia North
Sea Ltd
 
v. 
British Telecommunications plc
 
[2002] UKHL 4, [2002] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 553
Lord Hoffmann stated (at [100]) that he wished to ‘reserve the question of whether, in
the context of the contracts in the 
Hotel Services
 
and similar cases, the construction
adopted by the Court of Appeal was correct’. This remark is not sufficient to overturn the
line of authority represented by 
Hotel Services
. These cases therefore remain good law.
But they may not survive scrutiny in the Supreme Court. The current uncertainty
surrounding the meaning of the phrase ‘indirect or consequential loss’ is unfortunate
given the widespread reliance upon the phrase in practice and the size of many
consequential loss claims.
13.3
 
The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977
The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 made major changes to the law relating to exclusion
clauses in that it declared certain exclusion clauses ineffective and subjected others to a
reasonableness test. The Act was based on a report prepared by the Law Commission for
England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission. Further changes were made to
the Act by the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which now regulates exclusion and limitation
clauses contained in contracts between traders and consumers so that the Unfair
Contract Terms Act no longer regulates such terms. The approach that will be taken is to
set out the Act section by section. Each section will be followed by a brief commentary. It
will then conclude with consideration of two illustrative cases.
Before examining the first section of the Act it is necessary to make two preliminary
points. The first is that the Act is divided into three Parts. Part I applies to England,
Wales, and Northern Ireland. Each section in this Part, with the exception of section 8
(which is discussed at 
17.6
) will be given brief consideration. Part II applies to Scotland.
We shall not examine Part II, except for a comparison between section 17 and section 3.
Part II has many similarities with Part I but it is not identical. The failure to produce a
unified regime for the whole of the United Kingdom is an unfortunate feature of the
1977 Act. Part III consists of a miscellany of provisions which apply to the whole of the
United Kingdom. We shall examine some but not all of the sections in this Part. The
second point to note is that the Act only comes into play where it has been demonstrated
that the defendant is in some way liable to the claimant. This being the case, it is
important first of all to identify the basis upon which the defendant is liable to the
claimant before proceeding to apply the Act to the facts of the case. If, for example, the
liability of the defendant is in negligence, then the applicable section will be section 2 of
the Act. If, on the other hand, the liability is for breach of contract it will be section 3 or,
in the case of a contract for the sale of goods, section 6. The Act does not regulate
liability in the abstract; it regulates liability in respect of recognized causes of action and
it is vital first to identify the basis upon which the defendant is liable to the claimant.
13.3.1
 
Section 1
The text of Part I of the Act is as follows:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(3)
(a)
(b)
(4)
1
 
Scope of Part I.
For the purposes of this Part of this Act, ‘negligence’ means the breach—
of any obligation, arising from the express or implied terms of a
contract, to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill in the
performance of the contract;
of any common law duty to take reasonable care or exercise
reasonable skill (but not any stricter duty);
of the common duty of care imposed by the Occupiers’ Liability Act
1957 or the Occupiers’ Liability Act (Northern Ireland) 1957. This
Part of this Act is subject to Part III; and in relation to contracts, the
operation of sections 2, 3 and 7 is subject to the exceptions made
by Schedule 1.
In the case of both contract and tort, sections 2 to 7 apply (except where
the contrary is stated in section 6(4)) only to business liability, that is liability
for breach of obligations or duties arising—
from things done or to be done by a person in the course of a
business (whether his own business or another’s); or
from the occupation of premises used for business purposes of the
occupier; and references to liability are to be read accordingly but
liability of an occupier of premises for breach of an obligation or duty
towards a person obtaining access to the premises for recreational
or educational purposes, being liability for loss or damage suffered
by reason of the dangerous state of the premises, is not a business
liability of the occupier unless granting that person such access for
the purposes concerned falls within the business purposes of the
occupier.
In relation to any breach of duty or obligation, it is immaterial for any
purpose of this Part of this Act whether the breach was inadvertent or
intentional, or whether liability for it arises directly or vicariously.
Commentary
This section provides us with two important definitions and it also draws attention to
the fact that certain contracts are excluded from the scope of the Act. The first definition
is the definition of ‘negligence’ in subsections (1) and (4). Three points should be noted
about this definition. The first is that it assumes that a liability has arisen on the part of
the defendant because it refers to a ‘breach’ of an obligation to use reasonable care. This
being the case, an exclusion clause which has the effect of negating the existence of the
duty of care would appear to be outside the scope of the Act because the effect of such a
clause is to prevent a duty from arising in the first place. A defendant who does not owe
a duty of care to a claimant cannot be liable to that claimant. And, if he is not liable,
there appears to be nothing on which the Act can bite because there has been no ‘breach’
of any ‘duty of care’. As we shall see, the courts have not been receptive to a submission
that the effect of a clause is to prevent a duty of care from arising with the consequence
that the 
Act is inapplicable (see 
Smith
 
v. 
Eric S Bush
 
[1990] 1 AC 831 and 
Phillips
Products Ltd
 
v. 
Hyland
 
[1987] 1 WLR 659, see 
13.4
). Secondly, ‘negligence’
encompasses both contractual negligence (that is to say breach of a contractual duty to
exercise reasonable care) and tortious negligence (that is to say liability which has arisen
in tort rather than contract). Notwithstanding the title of the Act it is not confined to
liability for breach of contract. It can apply to notices which purport to exclude liability,
even in the absence of a contract between the parties (see section 2 of the Act extracted
later in this section). Thirdly, subsection (4) expands the definition of negligence by
making it clear that it does not matter whether the breach was inadvertent or intentional
or whether liability for it arose directly or vicariously. Vicarious liability arises where
one party is held liable for the wrongdoing of another. The principal example of
vicarious liability in this context is the liability of an employer for the negligence of his
employee.
The second definition is located in subsection (3), which makes it clear that the Act only
applies to attempts to exclude or restrict business liability as defined in the subsection.
An attempt by one party to exclude liability towards another in the context of a purely
private sale (for example, the sale by one member of the public to another of a motor car
or some other item) is generally outside the scope of the Act. ‘Business’ is defined in
section 14 (
13.3.9
).
The third point to note is the exclusion, referred to in subsection (2), of certain contracts
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(a)
(b)
from the scope of the Act. These contracts are referred to in Schedule 1 (
13.3.13
).
13.3.2
 
Section 2
Avoidance of liability for negligence, breach of contract,
etc
2
 
Negligence liability.
A person cannot by reference to any contract term or to a notice given to
persons generally or to particular persons exclude or restrict his liability for
death or personal injury resulting from negligence.
In the case of other loss or damage, a person cannot so exclude or restrict
his liability for negligence except in so far as the term or notice satisfies the
requirement of reasonableness.
Where a contract term or notice purports to exclude or restrict liability for
negligence a person’s agreement to or awareness of it is not of itself to be
taken as indicating his voluntary acceptance of any risk.
This section does not apply to –
a term in a consumer contract, or
a notice to the extent that it is a consumer notice, (but see the
provision made about such contracts and notices in sections 62 and
65 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015).
Commentary
A number of points arise in relation to the scope of section 2. The first is that it applies
both to contract terms and to notices. Notice is defined in section 14 (
13.3.9
). The
principal point to note in this context is that it encompasses non-contractual notices so
that the Act is not 
confined in its application to contract terms. A notice on land
(1)
purporting to exclude liability for damage caused by negligence can be subject to the Act
(at least if the liability that is sought to be excluded falls within the definition of business
liability in s. 1(3), discussed earlier). Secondly, section 2 only applies to attempts to
exclude liability for ‘negligence’ and negligence is defined in section 1. Here it is
important to recall that negligence means the ‘breach’ of an obligation to exercise
reasonable care. The section cannot therefore apply to attempts to exclude or restrict
strict liability, that is to say, liability that arises irrespective of fault. Thirdly, the section
only applies to clauses which ‘exclude or restrict’ liability. It does not apply to a clause
that simply ‘transfers’ a liability from one party to another (
Thompson
 
v. 
T Lohan (Plant
Hire) Ltd
 
[1987] 1 WLR 649). The distinction between a clause which ‘excludes or
restricts’ a liability and a clause which ‘transfers’ a liability is discussed further later (see
13.4
).
Fourthly, any attempt to exclude liability for death or personal injury caused by
negligence is ineffective (section 2(1)). The court is not given a choice in the matter: the
Act states that it is not possible to exclude liability for such losses. Personal injury is
defined in section 14 (
13.3.9
). Fifthly, in the case of other loss or damage, a term or
notice which purports to exclude liability in negligence is valid only if it satisfies the
requirement of reasonableness (section 2(2)). Reasonableness is defined in section 11
(
13.3.7
). Finally, section 2(3) has been enacted in order to prevent the protection of
section 2 being outflanked by a party relying on the term or notice for the purpose of
establishing the defence of 
volenti non fit injuria
.
 
Reliance cannot be placed on the
term or notice in order to establish that the claimant consented to the risk of suffering
injury and, consequently, has no claim. A defendant who wishes to rely on the defence of
volenti
 
must do more than point to the existence of the term or notice and the claimant’s
awareness of it or agreement to it. This being the case, section 2(3) makes it extremely
difficult for a defendant to make out the defence of 
volenti
.
13.3.3
 
Section 3
3
 
Liability arising in contract.
This section applies as between contracting parties where one of them
deals on the other’s written standard terms of business.
1
(2)
(a)
(b)
(i)
(ii)
(3)
As against that party, the other cannot by reference to any contract term—
when himself in breach of contract, exclude or restrict any liability of
his in respect of the breach; or
claim to be entitled—
to render a contractual performance substantially different
from that which was reasonably expected of him, or
in respect of the whole or any part of his contractual
obligation, to render no performance at all,
except in so far as (in any of the cases mentioned above in this
subsection) the contract term satisfies the requirement of
reasonableness.
This section does not apply to a term in a consumer contract (but see the
provision made about such contracts in section 62 of the Consumer Rights
Act 2015).
Commentary
Section 3 regulates attempts to exclude or restrict liability for breach of contract. Once
again, a number of points must be noted. First, it is vital to note that the section only
applies to contracts where one party ‘deals … on the other’s written standard terms of
business’. This phrase is of considerable importance because it is the gateway to the
application of the Act to commercial contracts. Commercial contracts concluded on
terms which are not ‘the other’s written standard terms of business’ are not regulated by
this section. The meaning of this phrase has been explored in a number of cases. The
Court of Appeal in 
African Export-Import Bank
 
v. 
Shebah Exploration & Production Co
Ltd
 
[2017] EWCA Civ 845, [2017] BLR 469 held that there are four components of a
claim that the requirements of section 3(1) have been satisfied (and the onus of proof is
upon the party who alleges that the requirements of the subsection have been satisfied).
The first is that the term must be written and the second is that the term must be a term
of business. Third, the term must be part of the other party’s standard terms of business
and, finally, the parties must deal on those written standard terms.
The meaning of ‘standard’ was explored by Judge Stannard in 
Chester Grosvenor Hotel
Co Ltd
 
v. 
Alfred McAlpine Management Ltd
 
(1991) 56 Build LR 115, 131 when he stated
that:
what is required for terms to be standard is that they should be so regarded by the party which advances them
as its standard terms and that it should habitually contract in those terms. If it contracts also in other terms, it
must be determined in any given case, and as a matter of fact, whether this has occurred so frequently that the
terms in question cannot be regarded as standard, and if on any occasion a party has substantially modified its
prepared terms, it is a question of fact whether those terms have been so altered that they must be regarded as
not having been employed on that occasion.
In 
African Export-Import Bank
 
v. 
Shebah Exploration & Production Co Ltd
 
(earlier)
the Court of Appeal affirmed that ‘standard’ requires a demonstration that the party
putting forward the terms ‘habitually uses these terms of business’. It does not suffice
for this purpose to show that the terms are sometimes used; it is necessary to go further
and demonstrate that they are invariably or usually used.
The meaning of ‘deals’ was considered by the Court of Appeal in 
St Albans City and
District Council
 
v. 
International Computers Ltd
 
[1996] 4 All ER 481. In that case
counsel for the defendants submitted that ‘you cannot be said to deal on another’s
standard terms of business if, as was the case here, you negotiate with him over those
terms before you enter into the contract’. Nourse LJ rejected this submission (at p. 491)
on the ground that ‘deals’ means ‘makes a deal’ irrespective of any negotiations that may
have preceded it. All that is required is for a party to enter into the contract on the other
party’s standard terms.
On the other hand, where there has been meaningful negotiation about the terms of the
contract which has resulted in alterations to the standard terms then it is much less
likely that the requirements of section 3 will have been satisfied (see 
The Flamar Pride
[1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 434). The Court of Appeal in 
African Export-Import Bank
 
v.
Shebah Exploration & Production Co Ltd
 
(earlier) held that it was relevant in this
connection to ask whether there ‘have been more than insubstantial variations to the
terms which may otherwise have been habitually used by the other party to the
transaction’. If there have been substantial variations it is unlikely to be the case that the
party attempting to invoke section 3 will have discharged the burden on it to show that
the contract has been made on the other’s written standard terms of business. The Court
of Appeal also held that there was no requirement 
that the negotiations relate to the
exclusion clause in the contract; it suffices that the negotiations relate to some part of
the standard terms of business.
The meaning of ‘other’s’ was considered by Judge Bowsher QC in 
British Fermentation
Products Ltd
 
v. 
Compair Reavell Ltd
 
[1999] BLR 352. The contract between the parties
was concluded on the Institution of Mechanical Engineers Model Form of General
Conditions of Contract. One of the issues between the parties was whether or not this
Model Form of contract fell within the scope of section 3(1). Judge Bowsher QC
concluded that it did not. He did not attempt to lay down any general principle as to
when ‘Model Forms drafted by an outside party’ fall within the scope of section 3 but
stated (at p. 361) that:
if the Act ever does apply to such Model Forms, it does seem to me that one essential for the application of the
Act to such forms would be proof that the Model Form is invariably or at least usually used by the party in
question. It must be shown that either by practice or by express statement a contracting party has adopted a
Model Form as his standard terms of business. For example, an architect might say, ‘My standard terms of
business are on the terms of the RIBA Form of Engagement’. Without such proof, it could not be said that the
Form is, in the words of the Act, ‘
the other’s
’ standard terms of business. I leave open the question what would
be the position where there is such proof, and whether such proof either alone or with other features would
make section 3 of the Act applicable. [Emphasis in the original.]
On the facts of the case it had neither been alleged nor proved that the defendants either
invariably or usually used the Model Form. Nor did the defendants state that they would
only be prepared to contract on the Model Form; they may well have been prepared to
contract on other terms. In the absence of proof of the practice of the defendants, the
vital question related to the burden of proof. Judge Bowsher QC stated that it was for
the claimants to show that the Act applied and this they had not done. This being the
case, the Model Form had not been shown to be the defendants’ standard terms of
business and section 3 did not apply to the contract between the parties.
One word in section 3(1) which has not, as yet, been litigated is ‘written’. Does section 3
apply to a contract that is partly written and partly oral? The Scottish case of 
McCrone
 
v.
Boots Farm Sales Ltd
 
1981 SLT 103 is sometimes cited in support of the proposition
that section 3 applies to such a contract. But 
McCrone
 
was concerned with the
interpretation of Part II of the Act and the wording of section 17 differs from the
wording of section 3. Section 17 uses the phrase ‘standard form contract’. The absence of
the word ‘written’ from section 17 made it easy for Lord Dunpark to conclude that the
section applied to contracts which are partly oral. It is much more difficult to reach this
conclusion in relation to section 3 given the use of the word ‘written’.
The second point to note in relation to section 3 is that section 3(2)(a) applies to clauses
that seek to exclude or restrict liability for breach of contract. Such clauses are subject to
the reasonableness test, on which see section 11 (
13.3.7
).
The third point relates to the subject matter of section 3(2)(b). This is a much more
difficult provision than section 3(2)(a). Given that the latter provision regulates
attempts to exclude liability for breach of contract, the former must regulate something
other than cases of breach because otherwise the two provisions overlap. So what is the
subject matter of section 3(2)(b)? It applies in two cases. The first is where one party
claims to be entitled to render a ‘contractual performance substantially different from
that which was reasonably expected of him’ and the second is where he claims to be
entitled to render ‘no performance’. An 
example in the latter category might be the case
where a defendant seeks to rely on a widely drafted force majeure clause (on which see
12.3.5
) in order to justify his failure to perform his obligations under the contract. There
is, as yet, no case on this issue and so the question whether section 3(2)(b)(ii) applies to
force majeure clauses remains a matter of some doubt. In practice it may be that the
issue will never be litigated because, even if the subsection is held to extend to force
majeure clauses, the likelihood of such a clause passing the reasonableness test is high.
Section 3(2)(b) has been the subject of some judicial analysis. The leading case is the
decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Timeload Ltd
 
v. 
British Telecommunications plc
[1995] EMLR 459. The plaintiffs sought an interlocutory injunction to restrain the
defendants, BT, from terminating the contract between them under clause 18 of the
contract which provided that BT had the right ‘at any time’ to terminate the contract
between the parties on the giving of one month’s notice. The reason why the plaintiffs
wanted an injunction to prevent termination was that they wanted to keep their
telephone number and termination of the contract would have deprived them of their
ability to do so. The plaintiffs sought to challenge the validity of clause 18 under section
3 of the Act. The application was for an interlocutory injunction and so it was not
necessary for the Court of Appeal to resolve definitively the scope of section 3(2)(b)(i).
Sir Thomas Bingham MR set out the submission of counsel for BT, Mr Hobbs, and his
response to that submission as follows (at p. 468):
Mr Hobbs submits that the subsection cannot apply where, as here, the clause under consideration defines the
service to be provided and does not purport to permit substandard or partial performance. He says that the
customer cannot reasonably expect that which the contract does not purport to offer, namely enjoyment of a
telephone service under a given number for an indefinite period. That may indeed be so, but I find the
construction and ambit of this subsection by no means clear. If a customer reasonably expects a service to
continue until BT has substantial reason to terminate it, it seems to me at least arguable that a clause
purporting to authorise BT to terminate it without reason purports to permit partial or different performance
from that which the customer expected. If, however, s 3(2) does not in its precise terms cover this case, I do not
myself regard that as the end of the matter. As I ventured to observe in 
Interfoto Picture Library Ltd
 
v. 
Stiletto
Visual Programmes Ltd
 
[1989] QB 433, 439, the law of England, while so far eschewing any broad principle of
good faith in the field of contract, has responded to demonstrated problems of unfairness by developing a
number of piecemeal solutions directed to the particular problem before it. It seems to me at least arguable that
the common law could, if the letter of the statute does not apply, treat the clear intention of the legislature
expressed in the statute as a platform for invalidating or restricting the operation of an oppressive clause in a
situation of the present, very special, kind. I say no more than there is, I think, a question here which has
attracted much attention in Commonwealth jurisdictions and on the continent and may well deserve to be
further explored here.
This is an adventurous decision. But it has to be remembered that it is a decision on an
interlocutory application and so cannot be regarded as the last word on the scope of the
subsection.
A more conservative approach was adopted in 
Peninsula Business Services Ltd
 
v.
Sweeney
 
[2004] IRLR 49. A term in a contract of employment stated that ‘an employee
has no claim whatsoever to any commission payments that would otherwise have been
generated and paid if he is not in employment on the date when they would normally
have been paid’. 
The claimant resigned his post with the defendants and, as a
consequence, he had to forgo substantial commission payments to which he would have
been entitled had he remained in employment. He challenged the decision to withhold
commission on the ground that the clause purported to entitle his employers to render a
contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably
expected of them. His claim failed on the ground that the defendants were simply
operating the contract in accordance with its terms so that section 3(2)(b) was not
applicable on the facts. Rimer J stated that the clause ‘simply defined the limits’ of the
claimant’s rights and did not purport to ‘cut down or restrict his rights in any way’. This
reasoning is very different to that adopted by the Court of Appeal in 
Timeload
 
and it is
open to criticism on the basis that it appears to ignore the fact that the aim of the
subsection is to extend the scope of the Act to certain duty-defining contract terms. Thus
the fact that the term assisted in the definition of the claimant’s rights should not, of
itself, have had the effect of taking the term outside the scope of the subsection. A better
ground for rejecting the claimant’s reliance on section 3(2)(b) was that there was ‘no
basis on which [the claimant] could ever have reasonably expected any rights greater
than’ those that the contract conferred on him. On this basis it would appear that the
distinction between 
Peninsula
 
and 
Timeload
 
lies principally in the weight given by the
(1)
(a)
(b)
(2)
court to the terms of the contract when seeking to ascertain the reasonable expectations
of the parties. It is suggested that the approach of the court in 
Peninsula
 
is the
preferable one and that a court ought to attach considerable weight to the terms of the
contract when identifying the reasonable expectations of the parties unless it can be
demonstrated that the party relying on the term of the contract either knew, or ought to
have known, that the other party to the contract was unaware of the term of the contract
and could not reasonably be expected to have been familiar with it.
The easier case to accommodate within the subsection is the case in which a service
provider purports to be entitled to offer the customer an alternative performance that is
of a lower standard than the service originally offered. Take the case of a holiday
company which reserves the right to offer its customer an alternative holiday should the
one which the customer originally booked turn out, for some reason, to be unavailable.
In offering an alternative holiday the company is not in breach of contract because it has
reserved the right to do so. But the customer may be able to challenge the validity of
such a term under section 3(2)(b), at least where the clause purports to entitle the
holiday company to offer a holiday of a lower standard than that originally offered (see

Section 6
Liability arising from sale or supply of goods
6
 
Sale and hire-purchase.
Liability for breach of the obligations arising from—
section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (seller’s implied
undertakings as to title, etc.);
section 8 of the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 (the
corresponding thing in relation to hire-purchase),
cannot be excluded or restricted by reference to any contract term.
Liability for breach of the obligations arising from –
(a)
(b)
(4)
(5)
section 13, 14 or 15 of the 1979 Act (seller’s implied undertakings as
to conformity of goods with description or sample, or as to their
quality or fitness for a particular purpose);
section 9, 10 or 11 of the 1973 Act (the corresponding things in
relation to hire purchase),
cannot be excluded or restricted by reference to a contract term except in
so far as the term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness. …
The liabilities referred to in this section are not only the business liabilities
defined by section 1(3), but include those arising under any contract of sale
of goods or hire-purchase agreement.
This section does not apply to a consumer contract (but see the provision
made about such contracts in section 31 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015).
Commentary
This section regulates attempts to exclude liability for breach of the implied terms in
contracts for the sale of goods (sections 12–15 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, on which
see 
10.2
) and contracts of hire-purchase (sections 8–12 of the Supply of Goods (Implied
Terms) Act 1973). Liability can be excluded provided that the term satisfies the
requirement of reasonableness (except in the case of an attempt to exclude liability for a
breach of section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or section 8 of the Supply of Goods
(Implied Terms) Act 1973, both of which are inevitably void). This section applies to any
attempt to exclude or restrict liability for breach of one of the implied terms, even if the
liability sought to be excluded is not a business liability within the meaning of section
1(3) of the 1977 Act (section 6(4)). This extension of the scope of the Act is not as big as
it might at first sight appear because the ‘satisfactory quality’ and ‘fitness for purpose’
implied terms only operate where the seller sells the goods in the course of a business
(see 
10.2
).

Miscellaneous contracts under which goods pass.
Where the possession or ownership of goods passes under or in pursuance
of a contract not governed by the law of sale of goods or hire-purchase,
subsections (2) to (4) below apply as regards the effect (if any) to be given
to contract terms excluding or restricting liability for breach of obligation
arising by implication of law from the nature of the contract.
Liability in respect of the goods’ correspondence with description or sample,
or their quality or fitness for any particular purpose, cannot be excluded or
restricted by reference to such a term except in so far as the term satisfies
the requirement of reasonableness.
…
Liability for breach of the obligations arising under section 2 of the Supply of
Goods and Services Act 1982 (implied terms about title, etc. in certain
contracts for the transfer of the property in goods) cannot be excluded or
restricted by reference to any such term.
Liability in respect of—
the right to transfer ownership of the goods, or give possession; or
the assurance of quiet possession to a person taking goods in
pursuance of the contract,
cannot (in a case to which subsection (3A) above does not apply) be
excluded or restricted by reference to any such term except in so far as the
term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
This section does not apply to a consumer contract (but see the provision
made about such contracts in section 31 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015).
Commentary
This section performs a similar function to section 6 but it applies to contracts other
than contracts for the sale of goods and contracts of hire-purchase under which
possession or ownership of goods passes to another party. Thus it applies to contracts of
hire, contracts for work and materials, and contracts of exchange. Liability can only be
excluded to the extent that it is reasonable to do so. The requirement of reasonableness
is discussed later in this section (
13.3.7
).
13.3.6
 
Section 10
10
 
Evasion by means of secondary contract.
A person is not bound by any contract term prejudicing or taking away rights of his
which arise under, or in connection with the performance of, another contract, so
far as those rights extend to the enforcement of another’s liability which this Part of
this Act prevents that other from excluding or restricting.
Commentary
This section gives rise to a number of interpretative difficulties. The effect of the section
has been summed up in H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell,
2021), para 17–131 (footnotes omitted) in the following terms:
The purpose of this provision has been said to be to prevent rights arising in favour of A under a contract
between A and B from being affected by the terms of a secondary contract between A and C which take away or
inhibit the exercise of those rights, as, for example, where a term in a contract between a manufacturer of goods
and a person purports to affect the rights of that person as buyer under the Sale of Goods Act against the retailer
from whom he purchases the goods. The scope of the section is, however, enigmatic. It employs the words
‘prejudicing or taking away rights’ instead of the usual ‘excludes or restricts liability’. The extended
interpretation of the latter phrase therefore does not apply. Also the reference to ‘the enforcement of another’s
liability
’ would preclude the application of s. 10 to a case where the terms of the secondary contract purported
to entitle a party to another contract to render a performance substantially different from that reasonably
expected of him, or to render no performance at all.
It has been held that the section does not apply to the compromise or waiver of an
existing contractual claim (
Tudor Grange Holdings Ltd
 
v. 
Citibank NA
 
[1992] Ch 53).

Explanatory provisions

The ‘reasonableness’ test.
In relation to a contract term, the requirement of reasonableness for the
purposes of this Part of this Act, section 3 of the Misrepresentation Act 1967
and section 3 of the Misrepresentation Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 is that
the term shall have been a fair and reasonable one to be included having
regard to the circumstances which were, or ought reasonably to have been,
known to or in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was
made.
In determining for the purposes of section 6 or 7 above whether a contract
term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness, regard shall be had in
particular to the matters specified in Schedule 2 to this Act; but this
subsection does not prevent the court or arbitrator from holding, in
accordance with any rule of law, that a term which purports to exclude or
restrict any relevant liability is not a term of the contract.
In relation to a notice (not being a notice having contractual effect), the
requirement of reasonableness under this Act is that it should be fair and
reasonable to allow reliance on it, having regard to all the circumstances
obtaining when the liability arose or (but for the notice) would have arisen.
Where by reference to a contract term or notice a person seeks to restrict
liability to a specified sum of money, and the question arises (under this or
any other Act) whether the term or notice satisfies the requirement of
reasonableness, regard shall be had in particular (but without prejudice to
subsection (2) above in the case of contract terms) to—
the resources which he could expect to be available to him for the
purpose of meeting the liability should it arise; and
how far it was open to him to cover himself by insurance.
It is for those claiming that a contract term or notice satisfies the
requirement of reasonableness to show that it does.
Commentary
This section is one of the most important provisions in the Act. The reasonableness test
applies to clauses that fall within the scope of sections 2(2), 3, 6(1A), 7(1A), 7(4), and 8.
It is therefore of wide application. A number of points can be made in relation to the
scope of this section. The first is that subsection (1) establishes that the time at which
the reasonableness test is to be applied is the time of entry into the contract. It is not the
time at which the breach of contract occurred. The aim of the reasonableness test is
therefore to examine the reasonableness or the fairness of the allocation of the rights
and responsibilities between the parties at the moment of entry into the contract.
The second point is that, in the case of contracts that fall within sections 6 and 7 of the
Act, the court is expressly directed by subsection (2) to take into account the matters
listed in 
Schedule 2 (
13.3.14
). However, the significance of the factors listed in Schedule
2 transcends cases that fall within the scope of sections 6 and 7. In practice, the courts
have regard to these factors even in cases that do not fall within the scope of sections 6
and 7.
The third point relates to the application of the reasonableness test to notices. It differs
from the test applicable to contract terms. Subsection (3) provides that it must have
been fair and reasonable to rely on the notice and that the court is to have regard to the
circumstances obtaining when the liability arose or when, but for the notice, it would
have arisen.
Subsection (4) requires the court to take into account two matters in the case of clauses
that seek to limit rather than exclude liability. It does not follow that these matters are
irrelevant in the case of total exclusions of liability; it is simply that they are particularly
relevant in the context of limitation clauses, in the sense that the court must have regard
to these factors. As we shall see (later in this section), availability of insurance has
proved to be an important factor in deciding whether or not a clause is reasonable.
Subsection (5) is an important provision because it puts the onus of proof in relation to
reasonableness upon the party who asserts that the term or notice is reasonable. It is
therefore unnecessary for a claimant to state in his statement of claim that he intends to
challenge the reasonableness of a clause (
Sheffield
 
v. 
Pickfords Ltd
 
[1997] CLC 648).
In deciding whether or not a particular clause is reasonable, the courts have regard to a
range of factors. Judges have a considerable degree of discretion in the application of
the reasonableness test to the facts of individual cases. The balancing of the different
factors is left largely to the decision of the trial judge. The appellate courts have been
extremely reluctant to review the findings of trial judges on the issue of whether a
particular clause is or is not reasonable (see 
George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd
 
v. 
Finney
Lock Seeds Ltd
 
[1983] 2 AC 803, see 
13.4
, and 
Cleaver
 
v. 
Schyde Investments Ltd
 
[2011]
EWCA Civ 929, [2011] 2 P & CR 221), unless the judge has had regard to some factor
which was irrelevant or has adopted an interpretation of the exclusion clause which is
incorrect (see, for example, 
Watford Electronics Ltd
 
v. 
Sanderson CFL Ltd
 
[2001]
EWCA Civ 317, [2001] All ER (Comm) 696).
When deciding whether or not the requirement of reasonableness has been satisfied, the
courts have had regard to factors such as the following:
(i)
 
The meaning of the clause.
 
This is clearly a very important factor. In 
Watford
Electronics Ltd
 
v. 
Sanderson CFL Ltd
 
[2001] EWCA Civ 317, [2001] All ER (Comm) 696
the Court of Appeal emphasized the need to ascertain the meaning of a clause before
deciding whether or not it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness. The clause in
dispute in 
Watford Electronics
 
was clause 7.3 which provided:
Neither the Company nor the Customer shall be liable to the other for any claims for indirect or consequential
losses whether arising from negligence or otherwise. In no event shall the Company’s liability under the
Contract exceed the price paid by the Customer to the Company for the Equipment connected with any claim.
The Court of Appeal held that it was necessary to ascertain the meaning of this clause
before applying the reasonableness test to it. Chadwick LJ stated (at [35]):
In order to decide whether the relevant contract term was a fair and reasonable one to be included having
regard to the circumstances which were, or ought reasonably to have been, known to or in the contemplation of
the parties when the contract was made it is necessary, as it seems to me, to determine, first, the scope and
effect of that term as a matter of 
construction. In particular, it is necessary to identify the nature of the liability
which the term is seeking to exclude or restrict. Whether or not a contract term satisfies the requirement of
reasonableness within the meaning of section 11 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 does not fall to be
determined in isolation. It falls to be determined where a person is seeking to rely upon the term in order to
exclude or restrict his liability in some context to which the earlier provisions of the 1977 Act (or the provisions
of section 3 of the Misrepresentation Act 1967) apply.
The meaning of the clause therefore has a direct bearing on the likelihood of it passing
the reasonableness test (see, for example, 
University of Wales
 
v. 
London College of
Business Ltd
 
[2015] EWHC 1280 (QB)). The wider the scope of the clause, the less
likelihood there may be that it will pass the reasonableness test. Conversely, the
narrower its scope, the more likely it may be to pass the test (
Regus (UK) Ltd
 
v. 
Epcot
Solutions Ltd
 
[2008] EWCA Civ 361, [2009] 1 All ER (Comm) 586). This can sometimes
produce the rather odd consequence that the party who is seeking to set aside the
exclusion clause is the party arguing that the clause has a wide meaning (for the purpose
of demonstrating that it is unreasonable), whereas the party relying on the clause
maintains that it is narrower in scope so that it can more easily establish that the clause
is reasonable.
(ii)
 
Equality of bargaining power.
 
The greater the equality of the bargaining power
of the parties, the more likely it is that the clause will pass the reasonableness test. The
Court of Appeal in 
Watford Electronics Ltd
 
v. 
Sanderson CFL Ltd
 
[2001] EWCA Civ
317, [2001] All ER (Comm) 696 took a particularly robust line in this respect. Chadwick
LJ stated (at [55]):
Where experienced businessmen representing substantial companies of equal bargaining power negotiate an
agreement, they may be taken to have had regard to the matters known to them. They should, in my view be
taken to be the best judge of the commercial fairness of the agreement which they have made; including the
fairness of each of the terms in that agreement. They should be taken to be the best judge on the question
whether the terms of the agreement are reasonable. The court should not assume that either is likely to commit
his company to an agreement which he thinks is unfair, or which he thinks includes unreasonable terms. Unless
satisfied that one party has, in effect, taken unfair advantage of the other—or that a term is so unreasonable that
it cannot properly have been understood or considered—the court should not interfere.
In so far as this statement suggests there must be some form of ‘advantage taking’ or a
failure to comprehend the clause before courts will intervene to declare exclusion or
limitation clauses unreasonable in contracts between ‘experienced businessmen
representing substantial companies of equal bargaining power’ it goes too far. But it
would be fair to say that the weight of judicial opinion demonstrates a marked
reluctance to invalidate a clause which has been agreed between two substantial
commercial parties who have access to legal advice. As Gross LJ observed in 
Goodlife
Foods Ltd
 
v. 
Hall Fire Protection Ltd
 
[2018] EWCA Civ 1371, [2018] BLR 491, [103], ‘at
least in the case of commercial contracts between parties of broadly equal bargaining
power, considerations of party autonomy and freedom of contract remain potent.’
Coulson LJ made a similar point when he stated (at [93]) that ‘the trend in the UCTA
cases decided in recent years has been towards upholding terms freely agreed,
particularly if the other party could have contracted elsewhere and has, or was warned
to obtain, effective insurance cover’. However, the fact that the parties are of roughly
equal bargaining power 
and had access to legal advice does not guarantee that the clause
will pass the reasonableness test. Exceptional cases can be found in which the courts
have concluded that an exclusion or limitation clause in such a contract is unreasonable
(see, for example, 
First Tower Trustees Ltd
 
v. 
CDS (Superstores International) Ltd
[2018] EWCA Civ 1396, [2019] 1 WLR 637, discussed in more detail at 
17.6
).
(iii)
 
Regard must be had to the clause as a whole.
 
The clause must be tested at
the moment of entry into the contract, not the moment of breach. This being the case,
the court cannot simply have regard to that part of the clause that is in issue between the
parties on the facts as they have turned out. It must have regard to the clause in its
entirety and the range of events to which the clause could realistically apply and decide
whether or not it is reasonable. However, there is a limit to the extent to which a court
should have regard to hypothetical events. In 
FG Wilson (Engineering) Ltd
 
v. 
John Holt
& Co (Liverpool) Ltd
 
[2012] EWHC 2477 (Comm), [2012] BLR 468, [96] Popplewell J
stated that the court should do so ‘only to the extent that they would have been
contemplated by the parties at the time of contracting as realistic and not unlikely’. In
particular, ‘the court should not be too ready to focus on remote possibilities or to accept
arguments that a clause fails the test by reference to relatively uncommon or unlikely
situations.’
The fact that a court may have regard to a range of realistic hypothetical events when
deciding whether or not a clause is reasonable has important implications for the
drafting of an exclusion or limitation clause. There is a temptation to draft the clause as
widely as possible in order to protect the client to the greatest extent possible. This is a
temptation which, in general, should be resisted. The reason for this is that the validity
of the clause can be tested at its weakest realistic point. Suppose that in a contract for
the sale of goods a clause states that a buyer can only reject goods if he does so within
seven days of the date of purchase and all other implied conditions in the Sale of Goods
Act are excluded. Such a clause may be entirely reasonable in relation to a patent defect
but it is probably unreasonable in relation to a latent defect. A commercial buyer faced
by such a clause can challenge it on the ground that it is unreasonable in its application
to latent defects. It should not matter that the actual defect in the goods was patent
because the validity of the clause is to be tested at the time of entry into the contract
(when the nature of the defect will be unknown) not the date of breach.
A further factor which suggests the need for caution is that the courts have held that
they do not have the power to sever the unreasonable parts of an exclusion clause so as
to render the clause reasonable (see 
Stewart Gill Ltd
 
v. 
Horatio Myer & Co Ltd
 
[1992]
QB 600). It can be argued that the courts should in fact have this power because of the
presence of the words ‘in so far as’ in, for example, sections 2(2) and 3(2). These words
might be thought to suggest that, to the extent that the clause is reasonable, effect
should be given to it. But the courts have thus far declined to embark upon the
modification of clauses with a view to saving as much of the clause as possible (except
where the term attempts, contrary to section 2(1), to exclude liability for death or
personal injury caused by negligence, where the courts have in effect deleted the invalid
attempt to exclude liability and proceeded to assess the reasonableness of the remaining
parts of the clause: 
Goodlife Foods Ltd
 
v. 
Hall Fire Protection Ltd
 
[2017] EWHC 767
(TCC), [2017] BLR 389). The clause will generally either stand or fall; it will not be re-
written by the courts. This has important consequences for the drafting of limitation
clauses. A limitation clause that is unreasonable because it is too low is ineffective to
place any limit on the liability of the party in breach. The court cannot insert into the
limitation clause a sum which it believes to be fair and reasonable. This being the case, a
limitation clause should always be set at a realistic level because the consequences of it
being held to be unreasonable as a result of it being set too low may be disastrous.
Given that the courts declare that they have no general power to separate out the
unreasonable parts of an exclusion clause from the reasonable parts, draftsmen
frequently carry out the task themselves and separate out an exclusion clause into
different constituent parts in the hope that, if one part is held to be invalid, its invalidity
will not spread throughout the clause. There are signs that the courts will respect this
drafting device and not spread the infection. For example in 
Watford Electronics Ltd
 
v.
Sanderson CFL Ltd
 
the Court of Appeal considered the two sentences in clause 7.3
separately when seeking to ascertain the meaning of the clause and the reasonableness
test should also be separately applied to each sentence. This being the case, any
invalidity in the first sentence should not necessarily result in the second sentence being
held to be invalid (see to similar effect 
Regus (UK) Ltd
 
v. 
Epcot Solutions Ltd
 
[2008]
EWCA Civ 361, [2009] 1 All ER (Comm) 586).
(vi)
 
The importance of insurance.
 
The court will have regard to the availability of
insurance but not to the actual insurance position of the parties (see 
The Flamar Pride
[1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 434). It is expressly directed to take account of the availability of
insurance in relation to limitation clauses (see section 11(4)). In 
Moores
 
v. 
Yakeley
Associates Ltd
 
(1999) 62 Con LR 76 the defendant agreed to provide architectural
services for the plaintiff. The defendant limited his liability to £250,000. The defendant,
a one-man company, had taken out insurance cover of £500,000. When asked why he
had not chosen £500,000 as the limitation figure, Mr Yakeley responded that (i) he
considered the figure of £250,000 to be reasonable having regard to the estimated cost
of the project (between £225,000 and £274,000) and (ii) he was concerned to leave
some allowance in case he had to meet any legal costs. Dyson J accepted the first of
these explanations and did not consider the second. But, given that it is the availability
of insurance that matters, the fact that the defendant was actually insured for a sum in
excess of the sum stipulated in the limitation clause should not suffice, of itself, to
establish that the limitation was an unreasonable one. If the loss in respect of which the
claim has been brought is one which the court would expect the claimant to be insured
against in any event, a court may be more inclined to conclude that it was reasonable for
the defendant to exclude liability in respect of that loss so that the claimant’s redress is
to claim on its insurance policy rather than seek redress from the defendant, particularly
in the case where the defendant has offered the claimant the option of additional
insurance cover in return for the offer of increased liability (
Goodlife Foods Ltd
 
v. 
Hall
Fire Protection Ltd
 
[2018] EWCA Civ 1371, [2018] BLR 491).
(v)
 
The dangers of relaxation of the clause in practice.
 
A party to a contract may
have good commercial reasons for not wishing to enforce an exclusion or limitation
clause against a customer, particularly a well-established customer. The fear of losing
business may lead it not to enforce the clause according to its letter. But such conduct
may lead a court to conclude that the term is unreasonable. Non-enforcement of the
clause was ‘the decisive factor’ that led the House of Lords in 
George Mitchell
(Chesterhall) Ltd
 
v. 
Finney Lock Seeds Ltd
 
[1983] 2 AC 803 (
13.4
) to conclude that the
term was unreasonable. In other cases the courts have taken a more relaxed view. In
Schenkers Ltd
 
v. 
Overland Shoes Ltd
 
[1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 498 Pill LJ stated (at p. 508):
In present circumstances, I see little merit in the defendants’ argument that the clause had not in practice been
relied upon. The give and take practised by the parties in the course of substantial dealings upon the running
account was admirable and conducive to a good business relationship but did not in my judgment prevent the
plaintiffs, when the dispute arose, relying upon the term agreed. In 
George Mitchell
, there was evidence that
neither party expected the 
limitation of liability clause to [be] applied literally and a recognition that reliance on
the clause was unreasonable. While there was evidence in the present case that there was no ready or frequent
resort to the clause, there was no such recognition. I cannot find conduct which permits the defendants to claim
that reliance on the clause would be unfair or unreasonable.
This suggests that it is important to examine the reason for the non-enforcement of a
particular clause. If it is attributable to the ‘give and take’ of business life it will do little
in terms of establishing the unreasonableness of the clause. But where the reason for the
non-enforcement of the clause is general recognition of the fact that the clause does not
operate reasonably it will provide very good evidence from which a court can infer that
the clause is unreasonable (as in the 
George Mitchell
 
case where Lord Bridge regarded
this as the ‘decisive factor’—see 
13.4
).
(vi)
 
Two different losses within the same clause.
 
It is not generally advisable to
include two very different types of loss within the same limitation clause. In 
Overseas
Medical Supplies Ltd
 
v. 
Orient Transport Services Ltd
 
[1999] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 273 the
defendant freight forwarders failed to insure the plaintiffs’ goods as they were required
to do under the terms of the contract. The defendants limited their liability, both for any
damage suffered during transit and in respect of their failure to take out insurance, to
£600. The trial judge held that a limitation of £600 would have been reasonable for a
claim for direct loss suffered by the plaintiffs while the goods were in transit, but it was
not reasonable for a failure to insure. He therefore held that the clause was
unreasonable and the Court of Appeal affirmed his decision. The two losses subject to
the £600 limitation were very different in nature. Had the goods been damaged in
transit the defendants’ liability would have been limited to £600 but the plaintiffs would
have been able to look to their insurers for the rest of their loss. But in the case of a
failure to insure, there was no one else to whom the plaintiffs could look in relation to
the loss in excess of £600. Potter LJ stated (at p. 280):
The burden of proof of reasonableness was upon the [defendants] in the case. Their position was that of a
trading organisation which, under a single contract had agreed to combine at least two activities or functions in
respect of which the nature of the work undertaken, the incidence of risk as between the parties, and the effect
of a breach of duty by the [defendants] were all of different character, yet were treated without distinction as
subject to a single limitation of liability of only £600. Whereas it may be that, in relation to certain ‘package’
services, a broad brush approach to limitation of liability will be reasonable, and indeed may largely be dictated
by the type of insurance cover available in the market to the supplier, the Judge held that, in this case, such an
approach was unjust and inappropriate for reasons which he clearly and comprehensively stated.
In my view, the judgment of Judge Kenny was a careful one in which he considered and weighed the various
considerations in a manner which is not open to any substantial criticism.
(vii)
 
The advantage of limitation clauses.
 
In many cases a sensibly drawn
limitation clause is more likely to pass the reasonableness test than a total exclusion of
liability. This proposition was thrown into some doubt by the decision of the Court of
Appeal in 
St Albans City and District Council
 
v. 
International Computers Ltd
 
[1996] 4
All ER 481 where it was held that a limitation clause of £100,000 in a contract to supply
a computer system to a local authority was unreasonable. The case generated a
considerable amount of concern in commercial practice but its impact has not proved to
be great. Indeed, there is very little discussion of the reasonableness of the clause in the
judgments of the Court of Appeal. The 
judges were content to conclude (at p. 492) that
the trial judge had not ‘proceeded upon some erroneous principle or was plainly and
obviously wrong’. In reaching his conclusion that £100,000 was unreasonable on the
facts of the case the trial judge, Scott Baker J, attached importance to the facts that the
parties were of unequal bargaining power (the plaintiffs being a local authority), the
defendants had not justified the figure which they had inserted into the contract, the
defendants were insured, and the party who stood to make the profit (here the
defendants) should also take the risk. The conclusion of Scott Baker J is perhaps
questionable but it was not, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, ‘plainly and obviously
wrong’.
Other cases can be found in which limitation clauses have failed the reasonableness test
(most notably 
George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd
 
v. 
Finney Lock Seeds Ltd
 
[1983] 2 AC
803, see 
13.4
) but it remains the case that they are likely to pass the reasonableness test
provided that the figure chosen is a realistic one (see, for example, 
Britvic Soft Drinks
Ltd
 
v. 
Messer UK Ltd
 
[2002] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 20). The onus of proof of showing that the
clause is reasonable lies on the party relying upon the limitation clause. This being the
case, that party must be able to lead evidence to show why it was that this particular
figure was chosen as the limit of liability. A figure that is simply plucked out of the air
will struggle to pass the reasonableness test. But a figure that is supported by some
objective justification, such as the turnover of the party relying on the clause, the
insurance cover available, or the value of the contract, will provide good evidence from
which a court can infer that the clause was in fact reasonable.
These factors do not purport to be exhaustive. Other factors are listed in Schedule 2 to
the Act (
13.3.14
). The task of the court in any given case is first to identify the factors to
be taken into account when deciding whether or not the clause is reasonable and it must
then balance these factors in a sensible fashion. A judge who carries out both of these
tasks is unlikely to be overturned by the Court of Appeal, should an appeal be lodged
against his decision.

Section 13
13
 
Varieties of exemption clause.
To the extent that this Part of this Act prevents the exclusion or restriction of
any liability it also prevents—
making the liability or its enforcement subject to restrictive or
onerous conditions;
excluding or restricting any right or remedy in respect of the liability,
or subjecting a person to any prejudice in consequence of his
pursuing any such right or remedy;
excluding or restricting rules of evidence or procedure;
and (to that extent) sections 2 and 6 to 7 also prevent excluding or
restricting liability by reference to terms and notices which exclude or
restrict the relevant obligation or duty.
But an agreement in writing to submit present or future differences to
arbitration is not to be treated under this Part of this Act as excluding or
restricting any liability.
Commentary
Section 13 is another section which seeks to regulate attempts to evade the clutches of
the Act. Subsection (1)(a) can catch a clause which puts a very short time-limit on the
availability of a particular remedy or any remedy; subsection (1)(b) might catch a clause
which 
excludes or restricts a right of set-off; and subsection (1)(c) would potentially
catch a conclusive evidence clause (a clause which states that acceptance of the goods
shall constitute conclusive evidence that the goods conform with the requirements of the
contract). These extensions of the scope of the Act are useful in so far as they reduce the
possibility of evasion by well-advised commercial parties. It is important to note that
section 13 does not have an independent role; that is to say section 13 cannot be used to
invalidate a particular clause. The function of section 13 is to extend the scope of
sections 2 and 6–7 and it is to these sections that a court ought to look for jurisdiction to
invalidate a clause. Section 13 cannot be used to extend the scope of section 3 but it is
probably unnecessary to expand the scope of that section given the width of section 3(2)
(b) (
13.3.3
).
Section 13(1) does, however, give rise to one very considerable interpretative difficulty.
It relates to the meaning of the words ‘terms and notices which exclude or restrict the
relevant obligation or duty’ at the end of the subsection. The effect of the addition of
these words is to extend the scope of sections 2 and 6–7 of the Act beyond clauses which
exclude or restrict a liability to clauses that define the relevant ‘obligation or duty’. The
problem is that all terms of a contract have a role to play in defining the obligations of
the parties. Once the step is taken of recognizing that some duty-defining clauses fall
within the scope of the Act, how can the courts decide which duty-defining clauses fall
within the scope of the Act and which do not? The difficulties involved in this extension
of the Act are neatly noted in the following passage from H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on
Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021, para 17–081, footnotes omitted):
It may be difficult, however, to differentiate between contractual provisions which exclude or restrict the
relevant obligation or duty, and those which define the scope of the obligation or which specify the duties of the
parties. A simple example of the latter may be found in the situation where a decorator agrees to paint the
outside woodwork of a house except the garage doors: in the view of the Law Commission, this would be ‘a
convenient way of defining the obligation’ and should not be assimilated to an exemption clause. Further
examples could be found where a seller of kitchen utensils expressly states that they are suitable to be used only
on electric cookers and not with gas, or a surveyor stipulates that he undertakes to carry out a valuation of the
property and not a full structural survey. However, in other cases there may be more difficulty in distinguishing
between provisions which exclude or restrict the relevant obligation or duty, and those which prevent it from
arising, such as a clause limiting the ostensible authority of an agent to give undertakings or an ‘entire
agreement’ clause.
We shall return to this issue, and the scope of section 13, when examining the decision
of the Court of Appeal in 
Phillips Products Ltd

Hyland

Section 14

Interpretation of Part I.
In this Part of this Act—
‘business’ includes a profession and the activities of any government
department or local or public authority;
‘consumer contract’ has the same meaning as in the Consumer Rights Act
2015 (see section 61);
‘consumer notice’ has the same meaning as in the Consumer Rights Act 2015
(see section 61);
‘goods’ has the same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act 1979;
‘hire-purchase agreement’ has the same meaning as in the Consumer Credit
Act 1974;
‘negligence’ has the meaning given by section 1(1);
‘notice’ includes an announcement, whether or not in writing, and any other
communication or pretended communication; and
‘personal injury’ includes any disease and any impairment of physical or mental
condition.
Commentary
This section provides a number of important definitions. Particularly important are the
definitions of ‘business’ and ‘personal injury’. It should be noted that the definition of
business does not purport to be exhaustive. A business need not necessarily be carried
on with a view to making a profit. It is here also that the definitions of those consumer
contracts removed from the scope of the Act are to be found.

Part III
 
Provisions Applying to the Whole of United
Kingdom Miscellaneous

International supply contracts.
The limits imposed by this Act on the extent to which a person may exclude
or restrict liability by reference to a contract term do not apply to liability
arising under such a contract as is described in subsection (3) below.
The terms of such a contract are not subject to any requirement of
reasonableness under section 3: and nothing in Part II of this Act shall
require the incorporation of the terms of such a contract to be fair and
reasonable for them to have effect.
Subject to subsection (4), that description of contract is one whose
characteristics are the following—
either it is a contract of sale of goods or it is one under or in
pursuance of which the possession or ownership of goods passes;
and
it is made by parties whose places of business (or, if they have
none, habitual residences) are in the territories of different States
(the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man being treated for this
purpose as different States from the United Kingdom).
A contract falls within subsection (3) above only if either—
the goods in question are, at the time of the conclusion of the
contract, in the course of carriage, or will be carried, from the
territory of one State to the territory of another; or
the acts constituting the offer and acceptance have been done in the
territories of different States; or
the contract provides for the goods to be delivered to the territory of
a State other than that within whose territory those acts were done.
Commentary
Section 26 of the Act provides that the limits imposed by the Act on the extent to which a
person may exclude or restrict liability by reference to a contract term (whether for
breach of contract or for misrepresentation) do not apply to liability arising under an
international supply contract, nor are the terms of such a contract subject to the
reasonableness requirement under section 3. Given the volume of cross-border
transactions that are concluded in the modern economy this is a very important
provision. An international supply contract is defined in section 26(3) and (4). The
phrase ‘made by parties’ in section 26(3)(b) is a reference to the principals to the
contract in question and not to the agents (
Ocean Chemical Transport Inc
 
v. 
Exnor
Craggs Ltd
 
[2000] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 446, 453).
Section 26(4)(a) has been held to be directed to any case in which the parties
contemplate at the time of entering into the contract that the contractual goods will be
transported across national boundaries in order to achieve the commercial purpose of
the contract, whether or not that transportation was necessary in order to fulfil the
terms of the contract. Thus a contract will fall within this subsection where a person who
carries on business abroad hires equipment from a supplier in this country in
circumstances where both parties know that the intention is to use the goods abroad
(
Trident Turboprop (Dublin) Ltd
 
v. 
First Flight Couriers Ltd
 
[2009] EWCA Civ 290,
[2010] QB 86). The reference in section 26(4)(b) to ‘the acts constituting the offer and
acceptance’ have been held to refer to the ‘totality of the acts which constitute the offer
and acceptance, including the making and receiving of each’ so that, where the offer and
acceptance were each sent by fax from different countries, the offer and acceptance had
been done in the territories of different States (
Air Transworld Ltd
 
v. 
Bombardier Inc
[2012] EWHC 243 (Comm), [2012] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 349, [82]). The requirement in section
26(4)(c) that the contract must provide for the goods to be delivered to the territory of a
State other than that within whose territory those acts were done has been strictly
interpreted. In particular, it is not enough to show that the goods have been delivered
‘in’ the territory of a State other than the State within whose territory the acts
constituting the offer and acceptance were done. The goods must be delivered ‘to’ that
country; in other words, the goods must have been delivered from a country which was
outside of that territory (

Choice of law clauses.
Where the law applicable to a contract is the law of any part of the United
Kingdom only by choice of the parties (and apart from that choice would be
the law of some country outside the United Kingdom) sections 2 to 7 and 16
to 21 of this Act do not operate as part of the law applicable to the contract.
This Act has effect notwithstanding any contract term which applies or
purports to apply the law of some country outside the United Kingdom,
where—
the term appears to the court, or arbitrator or arbiter to have been
imposed wholly or mainly for the purpose of enabling the party
imposing it to evade the operation of this Act.
Commentary
Section 27(1) of the Act states that where the law applicable to a contract is the law of
any part of the United Kingdom only by the choice of the parties, sections 2–7 of the Act
do not operate as part of the law applicable to the contract. Thus foreign parties who
choose English law as the law applicable to the contract do not thereby subject
themselves to sections 2–7. This is, however, subject to the limitation that the controls
contained in the Act cannot be evaded where it appears that the choice of law was
imposed wholly or mainly to enable the party imposing it to evade the operation of the
Act (section 27(2)).

Nothing in this Act removes or restricts the effect of, or prevents reliance
upon, any contractual provision which—
is authorised or required by the express terms or necessary
implication of an enactment; or
being made with a view to compliance with an international
agreement to which the United Kingdom is a party, does not operate
more restrictively than is contemplated by the agreement.
A contract term is to be taken—
for the purposes of Part I of this Act, as satisfying the requirement of
reasonableness … if it is incorporated or approved by, or
incorporated pursuant to a decision or ruling of, a competent
authority acting in the exercise of any statutory jurisdiction or
function and is not a term in a contract to which the competent
authority is itself a party.
In this section—
‘competent authority’ means any court, arbitrator or arbiter, government
department or public authority;
‘enactment’ means any legislation (including subordinate legislation) of
the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland and any instrument having effect by
virtue of such legislation; and
‘statutory’ means conferred by an enactment.
Commentary
The Act does not purport to regulate any contractual provision which is authorized or
required by the express terms or necessary implication of an enactment, nor any
contractual provision which is necessary in order to secure compliance with an
international agreement to which the United Kingdom is a party (section 29(1)).
Relevant statutes and international conventions include those relating to carriage of
goods by sea and carriage of passengers, goods, and luggage by air and by land.

The matters to which regard is to be had in particular for the purposes of sections

relevant—
the strength of the bargaining positions of the parties relative to each other,
taking into account (among other things) alternative means by which the
customer’s requirements could have been met;
whether the customer received an inducement to agree to the term, or in
accepting it had an opportunity of entering into a similar contract with other
persons, but without having to accept a similar term;
whether the customer knew or ought reasonably to have known of the
existence and extent of the term (having regard, among other things, to any
custom of the trade and any previous course of dealing between the
parties);
where the term excludes or restricts any relevant liability if some condition
is not complied with, whether it was reasonable at the time of the contract
to expect that compliance with that condition would be practicable;
whether the goods were manufactured, processed or adapted to the special
order of the customer.
Commentary
While a court is expressly directed to have regard to these factors where the validity of
the clause is challenged under sections 6 and 7 of the Act, the influence of these factors
is not confined to these contracts. The courts have regard to them in all cases where it is
appropriate to do so.
 
This means literally that to a willing person it is not a wrong and its effect is to deny a claim to someone who willing
accept the risk of loss.

Lord Bridge of Harwich
My Lords, the appellants are seed merchants. The respondents are farmers in

301b. of Dutch winter white cabbage seeds. The seeds supplied were invoiced as
‘Finney’s Late Dutch Special’. The price was £201.60. ‘Finney’s Late Dutch
Special’ was the variety required by the respondents. It is a Dutch winter white
cabbage which grows particularly well in the area of East Lothian where the
respondents farm, and can be harvested and sold at a favourable price in the
spring. The respondents planted some 63 acres of their land with seedlings grown
from the seeds supplied by the appellants to produce their cabbage crop for the
spring of 1975. In the event, the crop proved to be worthless and had to be
ploughed in. This was for two reasons. First, the seeds supplied were not ‘Finney’s
Late Dutch Special’ or any other variety of Dutch winter white cabbage, but a
variety of autumn cabbage. Secondly, even as autumn cabbage the seeds were of
very inferior quality.
The issues in the appeal arise from three sentences in the conditions of sale
endorsed on the appellants’ invoice and admittedly embodied in the terms on
which the appellants contracted. For ease of reference it will be convenient to
number the sentences. Omitting immaterial words they read as follows:
In the event of any seeds or plants sold or agreed to be sold by us not
complying with the express terms of the contract of sale … or any seeds or
plants proving defective in varietal purity we will, at our option, replace the
defective seeds or plants, free of charge to the buyer or will refund all
2.
3.
payments made to us by the buyer in respect of the defective seeds or
plants and this shall be the limit of our obligation.
We hereby exclude all liability for any loss or damage arising from the use
of any seeds or plants supplied by us and for any consequential loss or
damage arising out of such use or any failure in the performance of or any
defect in any seeds or plants supplied by us or for any other loss or
damage whatsoever save for, at our option, liability for any such
replacement or refund as aforesaid.
In accordance with the established custom of the seed trade any express or
implied condition, statement or warranty, statutory or otherwise, not stated
in these conditions is hereby excluded.’
I will refer to the whole as ‘the relevant condition’ and to the parts as ‘clauses 1, 2
and 3’ of the relevant condition.
The first issue is whether the relevant condition, on its true construction in the
context of the contract as a whole, is effective to limit the appellants’ liability to a
refund of £201.60, the price of the seeds (‘the common law issue’). The second
issue is whether, if the common law issue is decided in the appellants’ favour, they
should nevertheless be precluded from reliance on this limitation of liability
pursuant to the provisions of the modified section 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979
which is set out in paragraph 11 of Schedule 1 to the Act and which applies to
contracts made between May 18, 1973, and February 1, 1978 (‘the statutory
issue’).
[He first dealt with ‘the common law issue’ and concluded that ‘the relevant
condition’ was effective, as a matter of construction, to limit the appellants’ liability
to the replacement of the seeds or the refund of the price paid. He then turned to
‘the statutory issue’, which concerned the application of the reasonableness test to
the term in dispute.]
This is the first time your Lordships’ House has had to consider a modern
statutory provision giving the court power to override contractual terms excluding
or restricting liability, which depends on the court’s view of what is ‘fair and
reasonable’. The particular provision of the modified section 55 of the Act of 1979
which applies in the instant case is of limited and 
diminishing importance. But the
several provisions of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 which depend on ‘the
requirement of reasonableness’, defined in section 11 by reference to what is ‘fair
and reasonable’, albeit in a different context, are likely to come before the courts
with increasing frequency. It may, therefore, be appropriate to consider how an
original decision as to what is ‘fair and reasonable’ made in the application of any
of these provisions should be approached by an appellate court. It would not be
accurate to describe such a decision as an exercise of discretion. But a decision
under any of the provisions referred to will have this in common with the exercise
of a discretion, that, in having regard to the various matters to which the modified
section 55(5) of the Act of 1979, or section 11 of the Act of 1977 direct attention,
the court must entertain a whole range of considerations, put them in the scales on
one side or the other, and decide at the end of the day on which side the balance
comes down. There will sometimes be room for a legitimate difference of judicial
opinion as to what the answer should be, where it will be impossible to say that
one view is demonstrably wrong and the other demonstrably right. It must follow, in
my view, that, when asked to review such a decision on appeal, the appellate court
should treat the original decision with the utmost respect and refrain from
interference with it unless satisfied that it proceeded upon some erroneous
principle or was plainly and obviously wrong.
Turning back to the modified section 55 of the Act of 1979, it is common ground
that the onus was on the respondents to show that it would not be fair or
reasonable to allow the appellants to rely on the relevant condition as limiting their
liability. It was argued for the appellants that the court must have regard to the
circumstances as at the date of the contract, not after the breach. The basis of the
argument was that this was the effect of section 11 of the Act of 1977 and that it
would be wrong to construe the modified section 55 of the Act as having a different
effect. Assuming the premise is correct, the conclusion does not follow. The
provisions of the Act of 1977 cannot be considered in construing the prior
enactment now embodied in the modified section 55 of the Act of 1979. But, in any
event, the language of subsections (4) and (5) of that section is clear and
unambiguous. The question whether it is fair or reasonable to allow reliance on a
term excluding or limiting liability for a breach of contract can only arise after the
breach. The nature of the breach and the circumstances in which it occurred
cannot possibly be excluded from ‘all the circumstances of the case’ to which
regard must be had.
The only other question of construction debated in the course of the argument
was the meaning to be attached to the words ‘to the extent that’ in subsection (4)
and, in particular, whether they permit the court to hold that it would be fair and
reasonable to allow partial reliance on a limitation clause and, for example, to
decide in the instant case that the respondents should recover, say, half their
consequential damage. I incline to the view that, in their context, the words are
equivalent to ‘in so far as’ or ‘in circumstances in which’ and do not permit the kind
of judgment of Solomon illustrated by the example. But for the purpose of deciding
this appeal I find it unnecessary to express a concluded view on this question.
My Lords, at long last I turn to the application of the statutory language to the
circumstances of the case. Of the particular matters to which attention is directed
by paragraphs (a) to (e) of section 55 (5), only those in (a) to (c) are relevant [the
strength of the bargaining position of the parties, whether the buyer received an
inducement to agree to the terms or had an alternative source of supply which did
not contain such a term and whether the buyer knew or ought reasonably to have
known of the existence and extent of the term]. As to paragraph (c), the
respondents admittedly knew of the relevant condition (they had dealt with the
appellants for many years) and, if they had read it, particularly clause 2, they
would, I think, as laymen rather than lawyers, have had no difficulty in
understanding what it said. This and the magnitude of the damages claimed in
proportion to the price of the seeds sold are factors which weigh in the scales in
the appellants’ favour.
The question of relative bargaining strength under paragraph (a) and of the
opportunity to buy seeds without a limitation of the seedsman’s liability under
paragraph (b) were inter-related. The evidence was that a similar limitation of
liability was universally embodied in the terms of trade between seedsmen and
farmers and had been so for very many years. The limitation had never been
negotiated between representative bodies but, on the other hand, had not been the
subject of any protest by the National Farmers’ Union. These factors, if considered
in isolation, might have been equivocal. The decisive factor, however, appears
from the evidence of four witnesses called for the appellants, two independent
seedsmen, the chairman of the appellant company, and a director of a sister
company (both being wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same parent). They said
that it had always been their practice, unsuccessfully attempted in the instant case,
to negotiate settlements of farmers’ claims for damages in excess of the price of
the seeds, if they thought that the claims were ‘genuine’ and ‘justified’. This
evidence indicated a clear recognition by seedsmen in general, and the appellants
in particular, that reliance on the limitation of liability imposed by the relevant
condition would not be fair or reasonable.
Two further factors, if more were needed, weight the scales in favour of the
respondents. The supply of autumn, instead of winter, cabbage seeds was due to
the negligence of the appellants’ sister company. Irrespective of its quality, the
autumn variety supplied could not, according to the appellants’ own evidence, be
grown commercially in East Lothian. Finally, as the trial judge found, seedsmen
could insure against the risk of crop failure caused by supplying the wrong variety
of seeds without materially increasing the price of seeds.
My Lords, even if I felt doubts about the statutory issue, I should not, for the
reasons explained earlier, think it right to interfere with the unanimous original
decision of that issue by the Court of Appeal. As it is, I feel no such doubts. If I
were making the original decision, I should conclude without hesitation that it
would not be fair or reasonable to allow the appellants to rely on the contractual
limitation of their liability.
I would dismiss the appeal.

Commentary
A number of points should be noted about this case. First, the case is concerned with the
construction of the now repealed section 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. The factors
listed in that section are, however, very similar to those listed in Schedule 2 to the Unfair
Contract Terms Act 1977 and so the case is one of some significance for the
interpretation of the 1977 Act. Secondly, Lord Bridge sets out a very limited role for
appellate courts when reviewing decisions of lower courts on the reasonableness or
otherwise of a particular clause. An appellate court should ‘refrain from interference …
unless satisfied that [the original decision] proceeded upon some erroneous principle or
was plainly and obviously wrong’. Thirdly, Lord Bridge notes the issue relating to the
meaning of ‘to the extent that’. While he states that, in his view, the court does not have
jurisdiction to make an order to the effect that a party is entitled to recover half his
consequential losses, he is careful to say that it is ‘unnecessary to express a concluded
view on this question’. Finally, the ‘decisive factor’ which led Lord Bridge to conclude
that the term was unreasonable was the ‘recognition by seedsmen in general … that
reliance on the limitation of liability … would not be fair or reasonable’ (see further on
this point, 
13.3.7
).
PHILLIPS PRODUCTS LTD V. HYLAND
[1987] 1 WLR 659, Court of Appeal
The second defendants, Hamstead Plant Hire Co Ltd, hired an excavator to the
plaintiffs, Phillips Products Ltd. The excavator was driven by the first defendant, Mr
Hyland, who was also hired out to the plaintiffs. The contract of hire incorporated
the Contractors’ Plant Association (‘CPA’) conditions, Condition 8 of which stated:
‘When a driver or operator is supplied by the owner to work the plant, he shall be under the direction and
control of the hirer. Such drivers or operators shall for all purposes in connection with their employment
in the working of the plant be regarded as the servants or agents of the hirer who alone shall be
responsible for all claims arising in connection with the operation of the plant by the said drivers and
operators. The hirer shall not allow any other person to operate such plant without the owner’s previous
consent to be confirmed in writing.’
Considerable damage was done to the plaintiffs’ buildings as a result of Mr
Hyland’s negligence while operating the excavator. The plaintiffs brought an action
for damages against both defendants in respect of the loss that they had suffered
as a result of the negligence of Mr Hyland. The claim succeeded before the trial
judge. The second defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal and relied upon
condition 8 by way of defence. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and held
that condition 8 fell within the scope of section 2(2) of the Unfair Contract Terms
Act 1977 and that the trial judge’s conclusion that the clause was unreasonable
was neither plainly and obviously wrong nor based on an erroneous principle. This
being the case, condition 8 did not provide the second defendants with a defence
to the plaintiffs’ claim and they were, accordingly, liable in damages to the plaintiffs.

Slade LJ
[delivered the judgment of the court]
The issues arising on the appeal
The principal question arising on this appeal concerning the applicability or
otherwise of the Act … itself gave rise to three issues. The first two do not appear
to have been argued before the learned Judge … No objection, however, was
raised on behalf of Phillips to these points being taken … These three issues are:
On the admitted facts of the present case, was there on the part of
Hamstead ‘negligence’ within the definition of that word contained in section
1(1) of the Act?
If the answer to (i) is ‘yes’, is condition 8 a contract term which, apart from
the effect of the Act, can properly be said to ‘exclude or restrict’ Hamstead’s
liability for negligence within the meaning of these words in section 2(2) of
the Act? In considering this issue, it is necessary to bear in mind the
concluding words of section 13(1) which bring within the ambit of section
2(2) terms ‘which exclude or restrict the relevant obligation or duty’.
If the answers to (i) and (ii) are both ‘Yes’, does condition 8 satisfy the
requirement of reasonableness, within the meaning of that phrase as used
in the Act?
Issue (i)
As to (i), the argument for Hamstead is simple, and runs on these lines. If a claim
is based on contract, ‘negligence’ within the definition of section 1(1)(a) can have
occurred only if there 
has been a breach of ‘any obligation, arising from the
express or implied terms of a contract, to take reasonable care or exercise
reasonable skill in the performance of the contract’. So, it is said, if in the case of
such a claim the contract has by its express terms excluded liability for negligence,
there can ex hypothesi have been no breach of any obligation of the nature
referred to in section 1(1)(a).
The claim in the present case, as it happens, is of the nature referred to in
section 1(1)(b); the breach of a common law duty to take reasonable care is
alleged. Here again a similar argument is advanced. It is suggested that there can
be no breach of a common law duty to take reasonable care within the meaning of
section 1(1)(b), by a party to a contract which contains a condition which purports
to absolve him from liability for negligence.
These arguments, though superficially attractive, are in our judgment fallacious.
If correct, they would make nonsense of the 1977 Act. They would mean that the
very contractual term which pre-eminently is suitable to be subject to review for
reasonableness under the Act would be taken out of its scope. The Act, however, is
not nonsensical. Its purpose is not defeated by the wording of its first section. In
our judgment, in considering whether there has been a breach of any obligation of
the nature referred to in (a) or of any duty of the nature referred to in (b) or (c), the
court has to leave out of account, at this stage, the contract term which is relied on
by the defence as defeating the plaintiffs’ claim for breach of such obligation or
such duty, and section 1(1) should be construed accordingly.
If any support were necessary for this construction of section 1(1), it is to be
found in the concluding words of section 13(1) of the Act. For these words make it
clear that section 2 is capable of negating the effect of contract terms which
purport to exclude or restrict ‘the relevant obligation or duty’ …
Accordingly, though the validity of condition 8 still remains to be considered, on
the admitted facts of this case there was ‘negligence’ on the part of Hamstead
falling within section 1(1)(b) of the Act. This took the form of a breach (subject to
the effect, if any, of condition 8) of Hamstead’s common law duty to take
reasonable care, by reason of the fact that Mr Hyland who, subject to condition 8,
was Hamstead’s servant, had caused the loss to Phillips by his negligence in the
performance of his duties as such servant.
Issue (i) therefore has to be answered ‘Yes’.
Issue (ii)
Issue (ii) brings us to section 2(2). Subsection (1) does not apply because there
was, fortunately, no death or personal injury. Section 2(2), set out as incorporating
the relevant wording of subsection (1), provides that in case of other loss or
damage a person cannot by reference to any contract term exclude or restrict his
liability for negligence except in so far as the term satisfies the requirement of
reasonableness. The argument for Hamstead is that they do not, by reference to
condition 8, ‘exclude or restrict’ their liability for negligence. Condition 8, it is
stressed, is not an ‘excluding’ or ‘restricting’ clause. It may have an effect on the
liability for negligence which would otherwise have existed if there were, as there
was in the present case, negligence. (For ‘may’ we would substitute ‘must’
assuming that Hamstead’s submission as to the validity of condition 8 is correct).
Nevertheless, the condition does not, it is said, amount to an attempt by either
party to the contract to ‘exclude or restrict’ liability: it is simply an attempt on their
part to divide and allocate the obligations or responsibilities arising in relation to
the contract by transferring liability for the acts of the operator from the plant
owners to the hirers. A transfer, it is suggested, is not an exclusion; hence the
hirers fail at the section 2(2) hurdle …
We are unable to accept that in the ordinary sensible meaning of words in the
context of section 2 and the Act as a whole, the provisions of condition 8 do not fall
within the scope of 
section 2(2). A transfer of liability from A to B necessarily and
inevitably involves the exclusion of liability so far as A is concerned. … On the
particular facts of this case the effect of condition 8, if valid, is to negate a common
law liability in tort which would otherwise admittedly fall on the plant-owner. The
effect of condition 8 making ‘the hirer alone responsible for all claims’ necessarily
connotes that by the condition the plant-owner’s responsibility is excluded: In
applying section 2(2), it is not relevant to consider whether the form of a condition
is such that it can aptly be given the label of an ‘exclusion’ or ‘restriction’ clause.
There is no mystique about ‘exclusion’ or ‘restriction’ clauses. To decide whether a
person ‘excludes’ liability by reference to a contract term, you look at the effect of
the term. You look at its substance. The effect here is beyond doubt. Hamstead
does most certainly purport to exclude its liabilities for negligence by reference to
condition 8. Furthermore, condition 8 purports to ‘exclude or restrict the relevant
obligation or duty’ within the provisions of section 13(1) of the Act.
Issue (ii) has to be answered ‘Yes’.
Issue (iii)
Issue (iii) is the issue which alone it would seem, apart from the construction of
condition 8 itself, the learned Judge was asked to decide. Does the condition, on
the evidence and in the context of the contract as a whole, satisfy the ‘requirement
of reasonableness’, as defined by section 11(1) and elsewhere in the Act?
Under section 11(5) the onus falls on Hamstead to show that condition 8
satisfies the condition of reasonableness. For this purpose having regard to
section 11(1), it has to show that that condition was ‘a fair and reasonable one to
be included, having regard to the circumstances which were, or ought reasonably
to have been, known to or in the contemplation of the parties when the contract
was made’. As the learned Judge pointed out, all the relevant circumstances were
known to both parties at that time. The task which he therefore set himself was to
examine all the relevant circumstances and then ask himself whether, on the
balance of probabilities, he was satisfied that condition 8, in so far as it purported
to exclude Hamstead’s liability for Mr Hyland’s negligence, was a fair and
reasonable term. As to these matters, his conclusions as set out in his judgment
were as follows:
‘What then were the relevant circumstances? First, the second defendants carried on the business of
hiring out plant and operators. In contrast the plaintiffs were steel stockholders, and as such had no
occasion to hire plant except on the odd occasions when they had building work to be done at their
premises. There had been apparently only three such occasions: one in 1979, one in July 1980 when
the drainage trench was dug and the final occasion when the drainage was done in August 1980.
Secondly, the hire was to be for a very short period. It was arranged at very short notice. There was
no occasion for the plaintiffs to address their mind to all the details of the hiring agreement, nor did they
do so. The inclusion of condition 8 arose because it appeared in the second defendants’ printed
conditions. It was not the product of any discussion or agreement between the parties.
Thirdly, there was little if any opportunity for the plaintiffs to arrange insurance cover for risks arising
from the first defendant’s negligence. Insofar as the first defendant was to be regarded as the plaintiffs’
servant it might have been an easy matter to ensure that the plaintiffs’ insurance policies were extended,
if necessary, to cover his activities in relation to third party claims. Any businessman customarily insures
against such claims. He does not usually insure against damage caused to his own property by his own
employees’ negligence. Thus to arrange insurance cover for the first defendant would have required time
and a special and unusual arrangement with the plaintiffs’ insurers.
Fourthly, the plaintiffs played no part in the selection of the first defendant as the operator of the JCB.
They had to accept whoever the second defendant sent to drive the machine. Further, although they
undoubtedly would have had to, and would have had the right to tell the JCB operator what job he was
required to do, from their previous experience they knew they would be unable in any way to control the
way in which the first defendant did the job that he was given. They would not have had the knowledge
to exercise such control. All the expertise lay with the first defendant. I do not think condition 8 could
possibly be construed as giving control of the matter of operation of the JCB to the plaintiffs. Indeed in
the event the first defendant made it perfectly plain to Mr Pritchard, the plaintiffs’ builder, that he would
brook no interference in the way he operated his machine.
Those being the surrounding circumstances, was it fair and reasonable that the hire contract should
include a condition which relieved the second defendants of all responsibility for damage caused, not to
the property of a third party but to the plaintiff’s own property, by the negligence of the second
defendants’ own operators? This was for the plaintiffs in a very real sense a “take it or leave it” situation.
They needed a JCB for a simple job at short notice. In dealing with the second defendants they had the
choice of taking a JCB operator under a contract containing some 43 written conditions or not taking the
JCB at all. The question for me is not a general question whether any contract of hire of the JCB could
fairly and reasonably exclude such liability, but a much more limited question as to whether this contract
of hire entered into in these circumstances fairly and reasonably included such an exemption.
I have come to the conclusion that the second defendants have failed to satisfy me that condition 8
was in this respect a fair and reasonable term.’
…
In approaching the learned Judge’s reasons and conclusions on this issue, four
points have, in our judgment, to be borne in mind.
First, as the learned Judge himself clearly appreciated, the question for the
court is not a general question whether or not condition 8 is valid or invalid in the
case of any and every contract of hire entered into between a hirer and a plant
owner who uses the relevant CPA Conditions. The question was and is whether
the exclusion of Hamstead’s liability for negligence satisfied the requirement of
reasonableness imposed by the Act, in relation to this particular contract.
Secondly, we have to bear in mind that the relevant circumstances, which were
or should have been known to or contemplated by the parties, are those which
existed when the contract was made. Section 11(1) is specific on that point. Hence,
evidence as to what happened during the performance of the contract must, at
best, be treated with great caution …
Thirdly, the burden of proof falling upon the owner under section 11(5) of the
Act is, in our judgment, of great significance in this case in the light, or rather in the
obscurity, of the evidence and the absence of evidence on issues which were, or
might have been, relevant on the issue of reasonableness. One particular example
is the matter of insurance. The insurance position of all the parties was canvassed
to some extent in oral evidence at the trial, but such evidence seems to us to have
been singularly imprecise and inconclusive.
Finally, by way of approach to the issue of reasonableness, it is necessary to
bear in mind, and strive to comply with, the clear and stern injunction issued to
appellate courts by Lord Bridge in his speech, concurred in by the other members
of their Lordships’ House, in 
Mitchell (George) (Chesterhall) Ltd
 
v. 
Finney Lock
Seeds Ltd
 
[1983] 2 AC 803 at pp. 815–816:
[He set out a passage from the speech of Lord Bridge which is extracted,
earlier in this section, and continued]
In the context of issue (iii), criticism has been made by Hamstead’s counsel of
some parts of the learned Judge’s reasoning. It is said that in some respects he
misunderstood or mis-recollected the evidence. Some of the evidence was indeed
confused and not easy to follow. It is, in some passages, difficult to be confident
what was really meant. It may be that the learned Judge placed more stress than
we would think right on the lack of opportunity of Mr Phillips to study and
understand the conditions, and in particular condition 8. But this is the very sort of
point to which Lord Bridge referred in saying that there is room for a legitimate
difference of judicial opinion.
Against this, there is to be set the fact, as it appeared at the trial, that the
general conditions with their 43 clauses were adopted by and used by all the
members of the Trade Association to which Hamstead belonged. … Thus, we think
he was justified in saying that in dealing with Hamstead this was for Phillips in a
very real sense a ‘take it or leave it situation’ …
As appears from the passage which we have cited, other matters which
influenced the Judge in his decision on unreasonableness, and which we think
were clearly relevant factors to be weighed in the balance, were that the hirers
could play no part in the selection of the operator who was to do the work. Nor did
the general conditions contain any warranty by Hamstead as to his fitness or
competence for the job. Furthermore, despite the words in condition 8 ‘he shall be
under the direction and control of the hirer’, we think it reasonable to infer that the
parties, when they made the contract, would have assumed that the operator
would be the expert in the management of this machine and that he would not, and
could not be expected to, take any instructions from anyone representing the hirers
as to the manner in which he would operate the machine to do the job, once the
extent and nature of the job had been defined to him by the hirers; in short they
would tell him what to do but not how to do it. If such evidence is admissible, which
we do not find it necessary to decide, this inference would be strongly supported
by the evidence of what actually happened on the site before the accident
occurred.
It may be that in several respects this is a very special case on its facts, its
evidence and its paucity of evidence. But on these facts and on the available
evidence, we are wholly unpersuaded that the learned Judge proceeded upon
some erroneous principle or was plainly and obviously wrong in his conclusion that
Hamstead had not discharged the burden upon them of showing that condition 8
satisfied the requirements of reasonableness in the context of this particular
contract of hire. It is important therefore that our conclusion on the particular facts
of this case should not be treated as a binding precedent in other cases where
similar clauses fall to be considered but the evidence of the surrounding
circumstances may be very different.
Issue (iii) accordingly has to be answered ‘No’ and we dismiss this appeal.
Commentary
There were two principal issues at stake in 
Phillips
. The first was a jurisdictional issue,
namely whether or not the Act applied to condition 8, and the second was the
application of the reasonableness test to the clause. The jurisdictional issue is the more
difficult of the two. It had two aspects to it, being issues (i) and (ii) in the judgment. In
issue (i) the second defendants submitted that they had not been negligent, while in
issue (ii) they denied that condition 8 was a clause that attempted to ‘exclude or restrict’
liability. The essence of the defence was the same in both issues, namely that condition 8
had the effect of defining the obligations of the parties and did not provide the
defendants with a defence to a breach of an obligation. 
The Court of Appeal rejected
both arguments. Slade LJ held that, when deciding whether or not a defendant has been
negligent, the court must leave out of account, at least initially, the contract term which
is relied on by the defendant in order to defeat the plaintiff’s claim for damages for
breach of the duty to take reasonable care. The reasoning here is difficult. Why choose to
leave the exclusion clause out of account when seeking to identify the obligations that
have been assumed by the parties when the exclusion clause may be an integral part of
the definition of the obligations of the parties? The Court of Appeal gave two answers to
this question. First, the conclusion that there had been no negligence on the part of the
defendants would have made ‘nonsense of the Act’ because it would have taken
condition 8, and many other clauses, outside the scope of the Act. There is obvious force
in this point but it can be countered by the argument that the Act is itself based on a
false premise. The Act generally assumes that the function of an exclusion clause is to
provide the defendant with a defence to a breach of duty, whereas it can be argued that
the true function of an exclusion clause is to assist in the definition of the obligations
which the parties have assumed (see Coote, 
13.5
). The second answer given by the Court
of Appeal was that section 13(1) of the Act extends the scope of section 2 to clauses that
purport to exclude or restrict ‘the relevant obligation or duty’. The House of Lords in
Smith
 
v. 
Eric S Bush
 
[1990] 1 AC 831 also relied upon section 13 when rejecting an
argument advanced on behalf of the defendant surveyor that his disclaimer fell outside
the scope of section 2 because its effect was to negate the duty of care rather than
provide him with a defence in respect of his breach of duty. It is true that section 13
extends the scope of the Act to certain duty-defining clauses, as does section 3(2)(b), but
the problem with the section lies in identifying which duty-defining clauses fall within
its scope and which do not. There is no clear-cut solution to the latter problem. Where
the clause is held genuinely to reflect and give effect to the rights and duties which the
parties have assumed, it is likely that the Act will not be engaged (
Titan Steel Wheels Ltd
v. 
Royal Bank of Scotland plc
 
[2010] EWHC 211 (Comm), [2010] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 92,
[104]). On the other hand, where the clause attempts ‘retrospectively to alter the
character of what has gone before’ or ‘to rewrite history or parts company with reality’ in
relation to the assumption of responsibility by the defendant, then the clause is more
likely to fall within the scope of section 13 (
Avrora Fine Arts Investment Ltd
 
v. 
Christie,
Manson & Woods
 
[2012] EWHC 2198 (Ch), [2012] PNLR 35, [144]).
The jurisdictional issue raised in issue (ii) is also a difficult one. Here the second
defendants submitted that condition 8 did not seek to ‘exclude or restrict’ a liability.
They submitted that the effect of the clause was to ‘transfer’ a liability from themselves
to the plaintiffs and that ‘a transfer … is not an exclusion’. The Court of Appeal rejected
this submission stating that ‘a transfer of liability from A to B necessarily and inevitably
involves the exclusion of liability as far as A is concerned’. The subsequent decision of
the Court of Appeal in 
Thompson
 
v. 
T Lohan (Plant Hire) Ltd
 
[1987] 1 WLR 649
demonstrates that matters are not quite so straightforward. The case is factually similar
to 
Phillips
 
but the conclusion was different. An excavator and a driver, Mr Hill, were
hired out by the first defendants, T Lohan (Plant Hire) Ltd, to a third party. The
plaintiff’s husband was killed in an accident caused by the negligence of the driver of the
excavator. The plaintiff brought an action in negligence against the first defendants. The
claim succeeded and the first defendants then sought an indemnity from the third party
pursuant to condition 8 (which was in substance the same condition 8 as was in issue in
Phillips
). The third party denied any liability to indemnify the first defendants on the
basis that condition 8 was an exclusion clause which was invalidated by section 2(1) of
the 1977 Act. The Court of Appeal rejected this submission and held that the Act had no
application to condition 8. Fox LJ stated 
(at pp. 656–657) that there was a ‘sharp
distinction’ between the present case and 
Phillips
 
and that the distinction was that:
whereas in the 
Phillips
 
case there was a liability in negligence by Hamstead to Phillips (and that was sought to
be excluded), in the present case there is no exclusion or restriction of the liability sought to be achieved by
reliance on the provisions of condition 8. The plaintiff has her judgment against Lohan and can enforce it. The
plaintiff is not prejudiced in any way by the operation sought to be established of condition 8. All that has
happened is that Lohan and the third party have agreed between themselves who is to bear the consequences of
Mr Hill’s negligent acts. I can see nothing in section 2(1) of the 1977 Act to prevent that. In my opinion, section
2(1) is concerned with protecting the victim of negligence, and of course those who claim under him. It is not
concerned with the arrangements made by the wrongdoer with other persons as to the sharing or bearing of the
burden of compensating the victim. In such a case it seems to me there is no exclusion or restriction of the
liability at all. The liability has been established by Hodgson J. It is not in dispute and is now unalterable. The
circumstance that the defendants have between themselves chosen to bear the liability in a particular way does
not affect that liability; it does not exclude it, and it does not restrict it. The liability to the plaintiff is the only
relevant liability in the case, as it seems to me, and that liability is still in existence and will continue until
discharged by payment to the plaintiff. Nothing is excluded in relation to the liability, and the liability is not
restricted in any way whatever. The liability of Lohan to the plaintiff remains intact. The liability of Hamstead to
Phillips was sought to be excluded.
In those circumstances it seems to me that, looking at the language of section 2(1) of the 1977 Act, this case
does not fall within its prohibition.
While the Court of Appeal in 
Phillips
 
refused to draw a distinction between a clause that
‘excluded or restricted’ a liability and a clause which ‘transferred’ a liability, the Court of
Appeal in 
Thompson
 
drew a distinction between a clause that ‘shared’ a liability and one
which ‘excluded or restricted’ a liability. It did so by reading the words ‘to the victim of
the negligence’ into section 2(1) so that the subsection only regulates attempts to
exclude or restrict a liability towards the 
victim of the negligence
. This reading of
section 2 can, however, have some bizarre consequences. Suppose that Mr Hyland in
Phillips
 
had damaged the property of a third party instead of the property of the
plaintiffs. If the third party sued and recovered damages from Phillips in respect of the
property damage, Phillips would have been entitled to an indemnity from Hamstead
under condition 8 because, on these facts, there would be no attempt to exclude or
restrict a liability towards the victim of the negligence (the third party). But why should
the application of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 to condition 8 depend upon
whose property has been damaged? Either it is a reasonable condition or it is not. This is
not, however, the view of the Court of Appeal. The validity of the clause will turn upon
such fortuitous circumstances as the identity of the person who suffers loss as a result of
the negligence of the driver.
The second issue at stake in 
Phillips
 
was the application of the reasonableness test to
condition 8 (issue (iii) in the judgment). Once again we can see the deference shown by
the Court of Appeal to the decision of the trial judge. The Court of Appeal did appear to
have some sympathy with the criticisms levelled against ‘some parts of the learned
Judge’s reasoning’ but their reservations were not sufficiently strong to lead them to
intervene. But they did confine the precedent value of the case by stating that ‘in several
respects this is a very special case on its facts, its evidence and its paucity of evidence’.
This being the case, 
it cannot be assumed that condition 8 of the CPA conditions will be
unreasonable in all cases: much will depend on the facts of the individual cases. Given
the widespread use of the CPA conditions, this conclusion is unlikely to be a welcome
one.

Conclusion: Defence or Definition?
One of the issues that has surfaced from time to time in this chapter relates to the nature
of an exclusion clause. Is the function of the clause to assist in the definition of the
obligations that the parties have assumed or is its function to provide a defendant with a
defence to a breach of an obligation? The judges have tended to adopt the latter view
and have conceived of exclusion clauses in defensive rather than definitional terms. The
Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, with the exceptions of sections 3(2)(b) and 13(1), makes
the same assumption. This assumption has been challenged, most notably, by Professor
Coote. The essence of his analysis of the nature of an exclusion clause is to be found in
the following extract:
B COOTE, 
EXCEPTION CLAUSES
(Sweet & Maxwell, 1964), pp. 9–11 and 17–18
A suggested classification of exception clauses
All exception clauses … fall within one or other of the two following classes, which
it is proposed to call ‘Type A’ and ‘Type B’ respectively:
Type A:
 
exception clauses whose effect, if any, is upon the accrual of particular
primary rights.
Thus, where words relating to quality have been employed by a vendor of
goods, an exclusion of conditions, warranties, or undertakings as to quality, helps
determine the extent to which those words are contractually binding as, by the
same token, would a stipulation by the vendor that he should not be required to
make compensation for poor quality.
Type B:
 
exception clauses which qualify primary or secondary rights without
preventing the accrual of any particular primary right.
Examples would be limitations on the time within which claims might be made,
and limitations as to the amount which might be recovered on a claim. By contrast,
a clause which purported to take away a buyer’s right to reject goods would belong
to Type A.
To bring it within Type A, an exception may operate either directly or indirectly.
The direct effect requires little elaboration. If we suppose, for example, a promise
in general terms, and a series of particular exceptions from that promise, we have
a case where an exception clause is directly limiting the substantive contractual
content of a promise, or more technically, perhaps, is negativing any primary right
to performance of those matters excluded from the promise. Thus, where a horse
is sold warranted sound ‘except for hunting’, a purchaser will have no primary right
to call for a horse sound for hunting. An exception may have the same effect
indirectly, through the operation of the proposition that it is impossible to create
valid contractual rights while at the same time agreeing that they shall be at all
times unenforceable. A total exclusion, either of sanctioning rights or of procedural
rights of enforcement, would have the effect of making the apparent primary right
unenforceable. In so far as the ‘unenforceable right’ would be illusory (that is,
would have no existence as a contractual right), 
exceptions of this type would,
accordingly, have the effect on primary rights of preventing their accrual. Thus, if
the vendor of a horse should represent that the animal is sound but stipulate that
he shall not be required to make compensation if it should prove to be unsound,
then unless he is merely contradicting himself, he is indicating thereby that his
representation is a ‘mere’ representation and that he refuses to contract as to the
horse’s soundness. In other words, by excluding sanctioning rights he is indirectly
preventing the purchaser from acquiring any contractual primary right as to
soundness. Similarly, if the vendor should exclude sanctioning rights by providing
that ‘this agreement shall not be justiciable in the courts of any place or in any
circumstances’ then, either that provision is void as ousting the jurisdiction of the
courts, or it indicates that the agreement is an ‘honour’ agreement which does not
give rise to contractual rights and duties and which is binding in the moral sense
only.
By contrast, exceptions of Type B do not affect the question of whether
particular primary rights shall accrue, but merely qualify rights which ex hypothesi
do accrue. There are three ways in which they can do this. First, they may act
directly on a primary right, as by placing a limit on its duration. To take again the
sale of a horse ‘warranted sound’, a provision that unless the horse were returned
within three days it would be deemed sound would be an exception clause to this
second Type. It would not prevent a valid primary right to soundness from arising.
Secondly, they may act directly on sanctioning rights, as by placing a limit on the
amount recoverable for breach of particular primary rights. The carrier’s notice
limiting his liability to £5 in respect of any one package is a familiar example.
Again, a valid primary right to performance arises despite the exception. Finally,
the exception may lay down a time-limit within which an action may be brought.
Whether such limitations act directly on sanctioning rights, or only indirectly by
controlling procedural rights, the result is the same. Once the time-limit has
expired, the primary rights concerned become unenforceable and are extinguished
or fulfilled. But, until that time, they subsist as valid contractual rights. In other
words, the exception does not prevent particular primary rights accruing.
It ought, perhaps, to be emphasised that both types of exception clause help
define and delimit the rights to which they apply. One result of this is that rights
affected by exceptions of Type B are qualified from their inception by the exception
clause just as much as are the rights affected by clauses of Type A. What makes
the distinction between the two types significant and important is that if the effect of
clauses of Type A is upon whether particular primary rights shall arise from a
promise, they are directly relevant to the existence or otherwise, in that promise, of
substantive contractual content. Since promises are ordinarily expressed in a
number of words, or may have more than one aspect, the Type A exception may
help to determine how many of the words used give rise to rights and duties, or in
how many aspects the promise has contractual force. In the ordinary way a
contractual promise may give rise to a whole complex of rights. It can be the
function of an exception clause to show how many of these rights do in fact come
into existence. Where the question is, ‘has the promisor contracted to do this or
this?’ an exception of Type A will have a direct bearing on the answer …
Conclusion
If the argument so far has been accepted, it follows that the true juristic function
and effect of exception clauses are quite different from those currently ascribed to
them by the courts. Instead of being mere shields to claims based on breach of
accrued rights, exception clauses substantively delimit the rights themselves. A
large class of them prevent those rights from ever arising in the first place. As it
has been put in an American publication: ‘the ordinary function of an exception is
to take out of the contract that which otherwise would have been in it, or to guard
against misinterpretation’.
So regarded, the exception clause of Type A is seen to fulfil a function not
unlike that of an exception from grant, an analogy which, incidentally, did not
escape lawyers of the early nineteenth century. Just as an exception from grant
operates immediately to prevent its subject passing to the grantee, so an exception
clause of Type A operates immediately to prevent its subject forming part of the
rights and duties created by the contract.
It may seem feasible that the parties should have intended a contractual duty to
remain when they excluded liability for its breach, but this is in reality a juristic
impossibility. A duty of sorts there may be, but it will be a duty of honour, not a
contractual one.
It would follow, then, that the current approach to exception clauses is based on
a fallacy.
The analysis is a powerful one. But it has been attacked by Professors Adams and
Brownsword (1988) 104 
LQR
 
94, 95 on the ground that it is ‘elegantly formalistic’ and
that it ‘ignored both the historical development of the problem, and the realities of the
situation. Its implicit rejection by the draftsmen of UCTA was both realistic and right.’
The objection that the Coote thesis is ‘elegantly formalistic’ is an interesting one but it
can be countered by pointing out that the source of the formalism could be said to be the
Unfair Contract Terms Act itself and not Professor Coote. That this is so is demonstrated
by cases such as 
Thompson
 
v. 
T Lohan (Plant Hire) Ltd
 
and 
Phillips Products Ltd
 
v.
Hyland
 
[1987] 1 WLR 659 (both discussed at 
13.4
) where the issue before the Court of
Appeal was whether or not a distinction should be drawn between a clause which
‘excludes or restricts’ a liability and a clause which either ‘transfers’ or ‘shares’ a liability.
Any attempt to regulate clauses which ‘exclude or restrict’ liability but not other clauses
is bound to throw up questions relating to the meaning of ‘exclude or restrict’. To use
one of Coote’s examples, is there a difference between a case where a horse is sold
warranted sound ‘except for hunting’ and a horse which is sold warranted sound but the
warranty is followed by a clause which provides that ‘no liability is accepted for any
injury or loss suffered when using the horse for hunting’? The latter would appear to be
an exclusion clause but what about the former? The reason that we have to ask the
question whether or not a contract term which states that a horse that is warranted
sound ‘except for hunting’ is an exclusion clause is not because of Coote’s thesis but
because the Act requires us to ask the question. Had the Act enacted a general control
over all unreasonable terms in standard form contracts these jurisdictional issues would
not have arisen (except in relation to the definition of a ‘standard form contract’).

Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts
Central Issues
Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 implements a European
Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts (93/13/EC) into
English law. The Directive was first implemented into English law in
the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994 and then in
the Regulations of the same title enacted in 1999. The legislation has
made far-reaching changes to English contract law in that it has given
to the courts (and to regulatory agencies) broad powers to regulate
unfair terms in consumer contracts.
The aim of the legislation is to regulate unfair terms rather than unfair
contracts. Consequently, terms which specify the main subject matter
of the contract and terms which relate to the appropriateness of the
price payable under the contract by comparison with the goods
supplied under it do not fall within its scope. Consumers tend, on the
whole, to be aware of these terms and they can decide for themselves
whether or not to accept them. Matters are otherwise in relation to the
‘small print’ that often accompanies consumer contracts. Consumers
tend to be unaware of the content of these terms and, consequently,
are taken by surprise when they discover their content. The legislation
seeks to protect consumers against such ‘unfair surprise’.
The definition of an unfair term in section 62(4) of the 2015 Act is a
complex one. It consists of two principal elements. The first is that the
term must be ‘contrary to the requirement of good faith’ and the
second is that the term must cause ‘a significant imbalance in the
parties’ rights and obligations arising under the contract to the
detriment of the consumer’. When interpreting these phrases it is
necessary to bear in mind their European origin. This is particularly so
in relation to the definition of ‘good faith’. It must be interpreted from a
4.
5.
European and not an English perspective, although the strength of the
influence of EU law is likely to wane now that the UK has left the EU.
Schedule 2, Part 1 to the Consumer Rights Act 2015 sets out an
indicative and non-exhaustive list of terms that may be regarded as
unfair (the so-called ‘grey list’). The reach of this Schedule is
extremely broad.
Initially, a key role in the enforcement of the legislation was played by
the Unfair Contract Terms Unit of the Office of Fair Trading rather than
the courts and now by the Competition and Markets Authority.
Consumers tend to be reluctant to resort to the courts for the purpose
of vindicating their rights. Thus it has fallen to regulatory agencies to
play a leading role in persuading business to withdraw or re-draft
unfair terms.
14.1
 
Introduction
The European Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts (93/13/EC) was the
first major European intervention into the heartland of domestic contract law. As such,
it has attracted a considerable amount of academic comment. The Directive was initially
implemented into English law by the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations
1994 (SI 1994/3159). The 1994 Regulations came into force on 1 July 1995 but were
revoked and replaced by the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (SI
1999/2083), which came into effect on 1 October 1999 and were in turn revoked on 1
October 2015 when Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 came into effect.
The European origin of the legislation is important. First, it has had an impact on the
quality of its drafting. The 1999 Regulations in particular adhered closely to the text of
the Directive. This ‘copy-out’ technique does, however, have its drawbacks. In particular,
it has the effect of discouraging national Parliaments from taking steps to improve the
quality of the drafting of the Directive or to clarify any obscurities. The Directive on
Unfair Terms has been criticized for the poor quality of its drafting (see generally T
Hartley, ‘Five Forms of Uncertainty in European Community Law’ [1996] 
CLJ
 
265).
However, Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act departs from the text of the Directive in
some significant respects. In particular, the Directive only applies to a contract term
‘which has not been individually negotiated’ (Article 3(1)), but this requirement has not
been incorporated into the 2015 Act so that it is applicable to a contract term even if it
has been individually negotiated between the trader and the consumer. Such a term
may, given the fact of negotiation, be more likely to survive the challenge that it is unfair
but it is nevertheless within the scope of the Act. Secondly, the fact that the origins of the
legislation lie in a Directive has important consequences for its interpretation. This is
particularly so in relation to phrases such as ‘good faith’. The courts in such a case ought
to have regard to the European origin of the Directive and not interpret the UK
legislation as if it were a domestic statute. Thus far it would appear that the courts have
been sensitive to these European origins (although it should be acknowledged that the
UK courts have been criticized for failing to make references to the Court of Justice of
the European Union (‘CJEU’) on important matters relating to the scope of the
legislation and the Directive: see M Dean, ‘Defining Unfair Terms in Consumer
Contracts—Crystal Ball Gazing? 
Director General of Fair Trading
 
v. 
First National
Bank plc
’ (2002) 65 
MLR
 
773, esp pp. 780–781). However, now that the UK has
departed from the EU, it is no longer possible for the UK courts to make a reference to
the CJEU on a matter relating to the interpretation of the Directive, the UK courts are
not required to follow any decisions of the CJEU made after the date of the UK’s
departure from the EU and, in relation to decisions made prior to the UK’s departure,
the Supreme Court can depart from existing EU law but must when doing so apply the
test which it would apply when deciding whether or not to depart from its own case law.
It is therefore possible that the EU origins of Part 2 of the Consumer Rights 
Act 2015
will become less important in the future, particularly if the paths of the UK and the EU
begin to diverge sharply.
The remainder of the chapter is divided into two sections. Section 2 of the Consumer
Rights Act 2015. The text of the legislation will be set out and annotated. 
Section 14.3
will draw briefly on work done by Professor Susan Bright in relation to the role of the
Unfair Contract Terms Unit in the early days of the enforcement of what was then the
1994 Regulations.

Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015
The text of sections 61–76 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 is set out in full together
with Schedule 2 to the Act. Most of the sections are the subject of brief explanatory
comment but, where the meaning of the particular section is clear, no commentary has

Contracts and notices covered by this Part
This Part applies to a contract between a trader and a consumer.
This does not include a contract of employment or apprenticeship.
A contract to which this Part applies is referred to in this Part as a
‘consumer contract’.
This Part applies to a notice to the extent that it—
relates to rights or obligations as between a trader and a consumer,
or
purports to exclude or restrict a trader’s liability to a consumer.
This does not include a notice relating to rights, obligations or liabilities as
between an employer and an employee.
It does not matter for the purposes of subsection (4) whether the notice is
expressed to apply to a consumer, as long as it is reasonable to assume it
is intended to be seen or heard by a consumer.
A notice to which this Part applies is referred to in this Part as a ‘consumer
notice’.
In this section ‘notice’ includes an announcement, whether or not in writing,
and any other communication or purported communication.
Commentary
A trader is defined in section 2(1) of the Consumer Rights Act as a ‘person acting for
purposes relating to that person’s trade, business, craft or profession, whether acting
personally or through another person acting in the trader’s name or on the trader’s
behalf’ (which definition is applicable to Part 2 of the Act by virtue of section 76(2), see
later). The term ‘trader’ has been used in preference to ‘seller or supplier’ which is used
in the Directive and was used in both the 1994 and the 1999 Regulations. But the change
appears to be one that is related primarily to the choice of label and it is unlikely to have
significant effects in terms of substantive outcomes. A ‘business’ for this purpose
includes the activities of any government department or local or public authority
(section 2(7)). 
The definition of trader is therefore broad. A ‘consumer’ is defined in
section 2(3) as ‘an individual acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside the
individual’s trade, business, craft or profession’ (which definition is also applicable to
Part 2 of the Act by virtue of section 76(2)). Given that a consumer must be an
‘individual’, it follows that a company cannot be a consumer for the purposes of Part 2.
The requirement that the consumer act for purposes that are ‘wholly or mainly’ outside
his or her trade or business may give rise to some difficulty but (in particular via the
insertion of ‘mainly’) has the effect of extending the scope of the legislation to protect
the individual who is acting in the course of his or her business but the contract which
has been entered into with a trader is an incidental or infrequent part of the individual’s
business. The words ‘wholly or mainly’ are not to be found in the Directive. This
extended protection is further enhanced by the fact that it is for the trader to prove that
an individual was not acting for purposes wholly or mainly outside the individual’s
trade, business, craft, or profession (section 2(4)). It should also be noted that section 61
excludes certain contracts entered into by consumers from the scope of Part 2. Thus
contracts of employment or apprenticeship do not fall within its scope (section 61(2)).
Finally, it should be noted that Part 2 extends beyond ‘consumer contracts’ and can
encompass a ‘consumer notice’ (section 61(4)) and this extension may be of particular
importance in relation to notices that purport to exclude or restrict the liability of a
trader in negligence (on which see section 65).

An unfair term of a consumer contract is not binding on the consumer.
An unfair consumer notice is not binding on the consumer.
This does not prevent the consumer from relying on the term or notice if the
consumer chooses to do so.
A term is unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a
significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations under the
contract to the detriment of the consumer.
Whether a term is fair is to be determined—
taking into account the nature of the subject matter of the contract,
and
by reference to all the circumstances existing when the term was
agreed and to all of the other terms of the contract or of any other
contract on which it depends.
A notice is unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a
significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations to the detriment of
the consumer.
Whether a notice is fair is to be determined—
taking into account the nature of the subject matter of the notice,
and
by reference to all the circumstances existing when the rights or
obligations to which it relates arose and to the terms of any contract
on which it depends.
This section does not affect the operation of—
section 31 (exclusion of liability: goods contracts),
section 47 (exclusion of liability: digital content contracts),
section 57 (exclusion of liability: services contracts), or
section 65 (exclusion of negligence liability).
Commentary
In many ways section 62 is the heart of the legislation and it therefore requires more by
way of explanation. There are a number of points to note here.
The first is section 62(1), which sets out the consequences of a finding that a term in a
consumer contract is unfair (and section 62(2) does the same for a consumer notice). An
unfair term is not binding on the consumer. But it does not follow from this that the
contract is not binding. In most cases the contract will continue to bind the parties with
the exception of the unfair term (see section 67). The court is not, however, given a
power to re-write the term of the contract in order to make it conform with the fairness
requirement. Although the term is not binding on the consumer, the consumer is not
prevented from relying on the term or notice should he or she wish to do so (section
62(3)). Thus the term cannot be enforced against the consumer, but the consumer is not
deprived of the ability to rely upon the term.
Section 62(4) is perhaps the most important provision in Part 2, containing as it does
the essential definition of an ‘unfair term’ and the key ingredients of ‘good faith’ and
‘significant imbalance’ (and see section 62(6) for the equivalent provision applicable to
consumer notices). The meaning of both of these ingredients requires further
explanation.
Perhaps the more straightforward of the two is the requirement that there be a
‘significant imbalance’ in the parties’ rights and obligations under the contract to the
detriment of the consumer. Although more straightforward than the ‘requirement of
good faith’, the precise meaning of ‘significant imbalance’ remains elusive (and the need
for the imbalance to be ‘significant’ was emphasized by Kitchin J in 
Office of Fair
Trading
 
v. 
Ashbourne Management Services Ltd
 
[2011] EWHC 1237 (Ch), [2011] All ER
(D) 276 (May), [174]). It would appear to involve an examination of the content of the
term rather than the procedure which led to the conclusion of the contract (in other
words, it is directed at ‘substantive’ rather than ‘procedural’ unfairness—the difference
between these two categories is explored in more detail at 
20.1
). So in 
Director General
of Fair Trading
 
v. 
First National Bank
 
[2001] UKHL 52, [2002] 1 AC 481, [17] Lord
Bingham stated that ‘the requirement of significant imbalance is met if a term is so
weighted in favour of the supplier as to tilt the parties’ rights and obligations under the
contract significantly in his favour’. In 
Aziz
 
v. 
Caixa d’Estalvis de Catalunya, Tarragona
I Manresa
 
(Case C-415/11) [2013] 3 CMLR 89 the European Court of Justice had regard
to the extent to which the consumer was being deprived of an advantage which he or she
would enjoy under national law in the absence of the contractual term. But the
appearance of an exclusive focus on substantive unfairness may be misleading to the
extent that it cannot be assumed that the courts will not have regard to procedural
matters when deciding whether or not a term is unfair. Thus in 
Director General of Fair
Trading
 
v. 
First National Bank
 
(earlier) Lord Steyn, after referring to the observation of
Professor Collins that the test ‘of a significant imbalance of the obligations obviously
directs attention to the substantive unfairness of the contract’ (‘Good Faith in European
Contract Law’ (1994) 14 
Oxford Journal of Legal Studies
 
229, 249), proceeded to
observe (at [37]) that ‘it is … also right to say that there is a large area of overlap between
the concepts of good faith and significant imbalance’. In the latter statement one can see
a judicial reluctance to provide us with water-tight definitions of ‘significant imbalance’
and ‘good faith’ and instead a preference to adopt a much more fluid approach to the
interpretation of these concepts with an emphasis on their inter-dependency rather than
their independence.
These difficulties become even more apparent when we turn to the phrase ‘contrary to
the requirement of good faith’. There are two principal problems here. The first relates
to the 
relationship between ‘good faith’ and ‘significant imbalance’. Are these two
entirely separate requirements, two related requirements, or only one requirement? It
can be argued that there is only one requirement on the basis that the crucial test is
whether or not there has been a ‘significant imbalance’ to the detriment of the consumer
and that the conclusion that the requirement of good faith has not been satisfied follows
inevitably from a finding that there has been such a significant imbalance. On this view
good faith has no independent role to play at all and is practically redundant. A second
view is that ‘significant imbalance’ operates as a threshold requirement, which serves to
exclude cases where the imbalance is insignificant. On this view good faith becomes the
predominant test to be applied by the courts. A third view is that ‘good faith’ and
‘significant imbalance’ are both important and that one should not be subordinated to
the other. The difficulty with this view lies in distinguishing between ‘good faith’ and
‘significant imbalance’. What is the difference between the two tests? Does ‘significant
imbalance’ focus on the substantive content of the term, while ‘good faith’ looks to the
procedure by which the contract was concluded?
The second problem relates to the meaning of ‘good faith’. This is not an easy issue for
the English courts because English contract law does not, as yet, recognize a doctrine of
good faith (although there have been some tentative signs that it may develop a doctrine
of good faith in the performance of a contract, on which see further 
Chapter 15
). There is
therefore no national law from which the English courts can draw. The courts must
therefore draw upon the European origin of ‘good faith’ and they have been willing to do
so. The leading example is the decision of the House of Lords in 
Director General of
Fair Trading
 
v. 
First National Bank
 
[2001] UKHL 52, [2002] 1 AC 481. Two extracts
from the judgments of their Lordships are worthy of particular note in this context. The
first is Lord Bingham who stated (at [17]):
The requirement of good faith in this context is one of fair and open dealing. Openness requires that the terms
should be expressed fully, clearly and legibly, containing no concealed pitfalls or traps. Appropriate prominence
should be given to terms which might operate disadvantageously to the customer. Fair dealing requires that a
supplier should not, whether deliberately or unconsciously, take advantage of the consumer’s necessity,
indigence, lack of experience, unfamiliarity with the subject matter of the contract, weak bargaining position or
any other factor listed in or analogous to those listed in Schedule 2
 
of the regulations. Good faith in this context
is not an artificial or technical concept; nor, since Lord Mansfield was its champion, is it a concept wholly
unfamiliar to British lawyers. It looks to good standards of commercial morality and practice.
To similar effect is the judgment of Lord Steyn who stated (at [36]):
The twin requirements of good faith and significant imbalance will in practice be determinative. Schedule 2
 
to
the Regulations, which explains the concept of good faith, provides that regard must be had, amongst other
things, to the extent to which the seller or supplier has 
dealt fairly and equitably with the consumer. It is an
objective criterion. Good faith imports, as Lord Bingham has observed in his opinion, the notion of open and
fair dealing: see also 
Interfoto Picture Library Ltd
 
v. 
Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd
 
[1989] QB 433. And
helpfully the commentary to the 2000 edition of Principles of European Contract Law, prepared by the
Commission of European Contract Law, explains that the purpose of the provision of good faith and fair dealing
is ‘to enforce community standards of fairness and reasonableness in commercial transactions’: at 113; a fortiori
that is true of consumer transactions. Schedule 3
 
to the Regulations (which corresponds to the Annex to the
Directive) is best regarded as a check list of terms which must be regarded as potentially vulnerable. The
examples given in Schedule 3 convincingly demonstrate that the argument of the bank that good faith is
predominantly concerned with procedural defects in negotiating procedures cannot be sustained. Any purely
procedural or even predominantly procedural interpretation of the requirement of good faith must be rejected.
In considering whether the imbalance is contrary to the requirements of good faith, the
court will also have regard to whether the trader, dealing fairly and equitably with the
consumer, could reasonably have assumed that the consumer would have agreed to the
disputed term in individual contract negotiations (
Aziz
 
v. 
Caixa d’Estalvis de
Catalunya, Tarragona I Manresa
 
(Case C-415/11) [2013] 3 CMLR 89).
Section 62(5) sets out the matters to be taken into account in determining whether a
1
2
3
term in a consumer contract is unfair (and a similar provision applicable to consumer
notices is to be found in section 62(7)). The matters to be taken into account are broad
and include the nature of the subject matter of the contract and ‘all the circumstances’
existing when the term was agreed. It should be noted that the assessment is to be
conducted at the time that the term was agreed, not the time of any alleged breach or the
time of the hearing before a court (although the court can take account of circumstances
known at the time of entry into the contract as being likely to affect the future
performance of the contract, see 
Andriciuc
 
v. 
Banca Românească SA
 
(Case C-186/16)).
It is the fairness of the allocation of rights and liabilities at the moment of entry into the
contract that is subject to scrutiny. This being the case, the question that has to be
answered is whether or not the clause is potentially fair or unfair, not whether on the
facts of the particular case it operated in a fair or unfair manner. Further, the
assessment is not confined to the term which is alleged to be unfair but extends to
encompass ‘all of the terms of the contract or of any other contract on which it depends’.
In other words, the term must be considered in the context of the contract as a whole.
Section 62(5) bears some resemblance to the factors taken into account by the courts
when deciding whether or not a clause is reasonable under the Unfair Contract Terms
Act 1977 (on which see 
13.3
). The factors listed are very broad in scope. Indeed, they are
so broad that it can be said with some justification that they are likely to be of little
assistance in resolving individual cases.
However, a body of case-law is beginning to build up which will provide guidance on the
circumstances in which a court is likely to find that a contract term is unfair. Where a
term is one-sided and its terms have not been sufficiently drawn to the attention of the
consumer, the term is more likely to be held to be an unfair term (see, for example,
Munkenbeck & Marshall
 
v. 
Harold
 
[2005] EWHC 356 (TCC), [2005] All ER (D) 227
(Apr)). On the other hand, where the consumer has substantial experience of the issue
or knowledge of the risks covered by the disputed term (
West
 
v. 
Ian Finlay & Associates
(a firm)
 
[2014] EWCA Civ 316, 
[2014] BLR 324) or the term has been put forward by the
consumer’s professional adviser, it is less likely that it will be held to be an unfair term
(
Bryen & Langley Ltd
 
v. 
Boston
 
[2005] EWCA Civ 973, [2005] BLR 508), although it is
not impossible that the term might still be held to be unfair, particularly in the case
where the adviser did not inform the consumer of the drawbacks of the clause (
Harrison
v. 
Shepherd Homes Ltd
 
[2011] EWHC 1811 (TCC), [2011] All ER (D) 140 (Jul)).
The most important recent decision of the courts in the UK is the decision of the
Supreme Court in 
ParkingEye Ltd
 
v. 
Beavis
 
[2015] UKSC 67, [2016] AC 1172. Mr Beavis
refused to pay a charge of £85 for overstaying the permitted period of free parking in a
car park at a retail park. The signs displaying this information were accepted to be
reasonably large, prominent, and legible so that any reasonable user of the car park
would be aware of their existence and had a fair opportunity to read them. The notice
stated: ‘2 hour max stay … Failure to comply … will result in a Parking Charge of £85.’
Mr Beavis exceeded the time limit by one hour but declined to pay the £85 charge and
maintained that the term which sought to impose the charge was an unfair term. The
Supreme Court held that it was not an unfair term. Although the charge could be said to
reflect an imbalance in the rights of the parties, it did not arise ‘contrary to the
requirement of good faith’. ParkingEye were held to have a legitimate interest in making
this charge given that their business model also conferred on users of the car park an
entitlement to park free of charge for two hours. Although the court recognized that the
concept of a negotiated agreement to enter a car park was somewhat artificial, the
majority of the court concluded that a reasonable motorist in the position of Mr Beavis
would have agreed to a charge of £85 if they overstayed in return for free parking for a
two-hour period. Lord Toulson dissented. In his judgment ParkingEye had failed to
adduce the evidence necessary to establish that the consumer would have agreed to the
£85 charge, given that £85 is a substantial sum of money for many people (especially
those living on low incomes) and it was payable even if the consumer ‘overstayed for a
minute’. This view was not, however, shared by the majority who concluded that the
charge was not disproportionately high and, to the extent that it exceeded the
compensation that would have been payable to ParkingEye, the amount was justifiable
and not contrary to the requirements of good faith.
A wide range of contract terms has been found to be unfair since the time of the first
enactment of the legislation in 1994. As we shall see (
14.3
) the principal role in the
enforcement of the legislation to date has been played by the Unfair Contract Terms
Unit in the Office of Fair Trading (‘OFT’). Professor Bright has stated (S Bright,
‘Unfairness and the Consumer Contract Regulations’ in A Burrows and E Peel (eds),
Contract Terms
 
(Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 176) that:
[o]ver the five-year period 2000–2005, more than 5,000 terms were changed or abandoned following
investigation by the OFT. The unfair terms most frequently found are those excluding or limiting liability for
shortcomings in the quality of goods or services, those imposing financial penalties, and failure to use plain and
intelligible language. Also referred to frequently are unfair price variation clauses, cancellation clauses, and
clauses disclaiming liability for employee statements.

(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
Finally, section 62(8) avoids a potential conflict between section 62(4) and those
sections in the Act which expressly provide that a liability cannot be excluded. So, for
example, section 31 of the Act provides that a term of a contract to supply goods is not
binding on the consumer to the extent that it would exclude or restrict the trader’s
liability arising in respect of a breach of, for example, the obligation to supply goods of
satisfactory quality or which are fit 
for their purpose. In such a case a trader cannot seek
to maintain that the term is one which is fair because it satisfies the requirements of
section 62(4). Section 31 thus trumps section 62(4) with the consequence that the term
is not binding on the consumer.
63
 
Contract terms which may or must be regarded as unfair
Part 1 of Schedule 2 contains an indicative and non-exhaustive list of terms
of consumer contracts that may be regarded as unfair for the purposes of
this Part.
Part 1 of Schedule 2 is subject to Part 2 of that Schedule; but a term listed
in Part 2 of that Schedule may nevertheless be assessed for fairness under
section 62 unless section 64 or 73 applies to it.
The Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument amend
Schedule 2 so as to add, modify or remove an entry in Part 1 or Part 2 of
that Schedule.
An order under subsection (3) may contain transitional or transitory
provision or savings.
No order may be made under subsection (3) unless a draft of the statutory
instrument containing it has been laid before, and approved by a resolution
of, each House of Parliament.
A term of a consumer contract must be regarded as unfair if it has the effect
that the consumer bears the burden of proof with respect to compliance by
a distance supplier or an intermediary with an obligation under any
enactment or rule implementing the Distance Marketing Directive.
In subsection (6)—
‘the Distance Marketing Directive’ means Directive 2002/65/EC of the European
(a)
(b)
Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 concerning the distance
marketing of consumer financial services and amending Council Directive
90/619/EEC and Directives 97/7/EC and 98/27/EC;
‘distance supplier’ means—
a supplier under a distance contract within the meaning of the
Financial Services (Distance Marketing) Regulations 2004 (SI
2004/2095), or
a supplier of unsolicited financial services within the meaning of
regulation 15 of those regulations;
‘enactment’ includes an enactment contained in subordinate legislation within
the meaning of the Interpretation Act 1978;
‘intermediary’ has the same meaning as in the Financial Services (Distance
Marketing) Regulations 2004;
‘rule’ means a rule made by the Financial Conduct Authority or the Prudential
Regulation Authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 or by a
designated professional body within the meaning of section 326(2) of that Act.
Commentary
The most important provision here is section 63(1), which refers to Part 1 of Schedule 2
which gives what is called an ‘indicative and non-exhaustive list’ of terms that may be
regarded as unfair (see later in this section). Inclusion on the list does not therefore
entail a finding that the term is unfair. The precise status of the list is unclear. It could
be said to raise a presumption that the term is unfair. On the other hand, it has been
said that the list is only a ‘guide’ and that it does not create rebuttable presumptions of
unfairness. In the case of a term that is not listed 
in Part 1 of Schedule 2, the onus of
proof of establishing that the term is unfair is likely to be on the consumer. Where the
term is listed in Part 1 of Schedule 2 the position is less clear. The answer probably
depends upon the status of the list in Part 1. If it creates a rebuttable presumption that
the term is unfair then the burden of proof is likely to shift to the trader to show that the
term is fair. On the other hand, if the list is no more than a guide, then the burden of
(1)
(a)
(b)
(2)

(6)
proof will probably remain with the consumer, although the fact that the term is
included in the list will doubtless make it easier for the consumer to establish that the
term is unfair.

Exclusion from assessment of fairness
A term of a consumer contract may not be assessed for fairness under
section 62 to the extent that—
it specifies the main subject matter of the contract, or
the assessment is of the appropriateness of the price payable under
the contract by comparison with the goods, digital content or
services supplied under it.
Subsection (1) excludes a term from an assessment under section 62 only
if it is transparent and prominent.
A term is transparent for the purposes of this Part if it is expressed in plain
and intelligible language and (in the case of a written term) is legible.
A term is prominent for the purposes of this section if it is brought to the
consumer’s attention in such a way that an average consumer would be
aware of the term.
In subsection (4) ‘average consumer’ means a consumer who is reasonably
well-informed, observant and circumspect.
This section does not apply to a term of a contract listed in Part 1 of
Schedule 2.
Commentary
This is another difficult provision and it has been the subject of a considerable amount
of case-law, not all of which is easy to reconcile. Its essential effect is to exclude certain
terms from certain forms of assessment. The terms which are exempt are identified in
section 64(1), and the extent of the exemption is identified in section 64(2) (although in
the case of section 64(1)(b) the distinction between an excluded term and exclusion from
certain forms of assessment is not entirely easy to draw).
There are three principal points to note. The first is that section 62(2)). The requirement
that the term be ‘transparent and prominent’ is a new one, replacing the previous test,
which exempted certain terms from assessment provided that they were ‘in plain
intelligible language’. It can be seen that the ‘plain intelligible language’ requirement has
effectively been incorporated into the requirement that the term be ‘transparent’
(section 64(3)). So the change that has been made here may be a change of label rather
than substance. The ‘plain intelligible language’ requirement proved to be a rather
demanding test. Thus the Court of Justice of the European Union has stated on a
number of occasions that the requirement cannot be reduced to a requirement that the
term be formally and grammatically intelligible. Thus in 
GT
 
v. 
HS
 
(Case C-38/17), [33]
the Court stated that the requirement ‘means that the contract should indicate
transparently and specifically how the mechanism to which the relevant term relates is
to function and, where appropriate, the 
relationship between that mechanism and that
provided for by other contractual terms, so that the consumer is in a position to
evaluate, on the basis of clear, intelligible criteria, the economic consequences for him of
entering into the contract’. The requirement that the term be transparent and prominent
in section 64(2) is thus not to be equated with the 
contra proferentem
 
rule (
Office of
Fair Trading
 
v. 
Abbey National plc
 
[2008] EWHC 875 (Comm), [2008] 2 All ER
(Comm) 625, [87]). It is a more demanding test and so it is not the case that a written
term is necessarily ‘transparent’ unless there is a doubt about its true meaning. When
considering whether a term is ‘prominent’ the court is directed to consider whether the
reasonably well-informed, observant, and circumspect consumer would have been
aware of the term. The requirement is that steps are taken to make such a consumer
‘aware’ of the term. There is no requirement that the consumer be given all the
information that he or she needs in order to make an informed decision whether or not
to enter into the contract. Nor is there a requirement that a trader give the consumer
advice about the contract terms that he or she is offered. In other respects the
requirement that the term be ‘transparent and prominent’ is likely to be a demanding
one. A party does not discharge its obligations by making a ‘commendable effort’ to
make the terms plain and intelligible (
Office of Fair Trading
 
v. 
Abbey National plc
[2008] EWHC 875 (Comm), [2008] 2 All ER (Comm) 625, [121]). A term is exempt
from assessment as to its fairness only if it 
is
 
transparent and prominent.
The second point relates to the exclusion to be found in section 64(1)(a). The exclusion
is of a term which ‘specifies the main subject matter of the contract’. The wording of
section 64(1)(a) differs slightly from the equivalent provision in the 1999 Regulations
(regulation 6(2)(a)) which applied to terms that relate to the ‘definition of the main
subject matter of the contract’. Once again, the change (from ‘definition’ to ‘specifies’)
would appear to be a change of label which does not have much by way of substantive
effect. It is the word ‘main’ that is important here. It is not any term that specifies any
aspect of the subject matter of the contract which is exempt from review: it is only a
term which specifies the ‘main’ or essential subject matter of the contract (
Andriciuc
 
v.
Banca Rom
â
neasc
ă 
SA
 
(Case C-186/16)).
The third point relates to the exclusion to be found in what is now section 64(1)(b),
which has generated the case-law which is not easy to reconcile. The case-law has arisen
under the equivalent provisions in the 1994 and the 1999 Regulations. Regulation 6(2)
(b) of the 1999 Regulations provided that the assessment of fairness of a term shall not
relate to ‘the adequacy of the price or remuneration, as against the goods or services
supplied in exchange’ (the equivalent term in the 1994 Regulations was to be found in
regulation 3(2)(b)). Unlike section 64(1)(a), this subsection is not confined to the ‘main’
or ‘essential’ price term. In principle it catches any term that purports to assess the
appropriateness of the price payable under the contract by comparison with the goods,
digital content, or services supplied under it. Before turning to a consideration of the
scope of section 64(1)(b), it is important to have regard to the two leading decisions on
the predecessors to section 64(1)(b), namely the decision of the House of Lords in
Director General of Fair Trading
 
v. 
First National Bank
 
[2001] UKHL 52, [2002] 1 AC
481 and the decision of the Supreme Court in 
Office of Fair Trading
 
v. 
Abbey National
plc
 
[2009] UKSC 6, [2010] 1 AC 696.
In the 
First National Bank
 
case clause 8 of the bank’s standard terms of business
provided that, should the customer default on repayments to it, the bank was to be
entitled to recover from the customer the whole of the balance on the customer’s loan
account together with outstanding interest and the costs of seeking judgment. The
particular provision to which the Director of Fair Trading objected was one which
applied in the case where a customer of the bank paid off an outstanding loan pursuant
to an instalment scheme that had been approved by a court. The effect of clause 8 was
that interest 
continued to accrue on the unpaid balance of the debt so that payment
pursuant to the instalment scheme did not necessarily have the effect of discharging the
debt. Thus many customers were faced with a demand for further payment in relation to
the interest which had accrued under the relevant clause on completion of their
payments pursuant to the instalment scheme that had been approved by the court. One
of the points taken by the bank by way of defence was that clause 8 was a term which
concerned the adequacy of the price or remuneration, as against the goods or services
supplied in exchange and thus was exempt from assessment. The House of Lords
rejected this submission. Particularly important was Lord Steyn’s observation at [34]
that what is now section 64(1)(b) should be interpreted ‘restrictively’, otherwise it would
‘enable the main purpose of the scheme to be frustrated by endless formalistic
arguments as to whether a provision is a definitional or an exclusionary provision’.
The second case is the decision of the Supreme Court in 
Office of Fair Trading
 
v. 
Abbey
National plc
 
[2009] UKSC 6, [2010] 1 AC 696, where the issue before the court was
whether the fairness of bank charges levied on personal current account customers in
respect of what may broadly be termed unauthorized overdrafts could be challenged
under the 1999 Regulations. An example of the type of charge under scrutiny was an
‘overdraft excess charge’ which is levied if, during a specified period, an account is or
goes overdrawn (and there is no overdraft facility) or the debit balance is or goes above
the limit of an existing facility, in both cases irrespective of the reason why the excess
has occurred. The terms were held at first instance and in the Court of Appeal to fall
within the scope of the Regulations so that they were subject to assessment on the
grounds of fairness. But, on appeal, the Supreme Court held, rather surprisingly, that
the relevant charges constituted part of the price or remuneration for the banking
services provided by the banks and, in so far as the terms had been found to be in plain
intelligible language, any assessment of the fairness of those terms which related to their
adequacy as against the services supplied was excluded by regulation 6(2)(b) of the 1999
Regulations. The words ‘related to their adequacy as against services supplied’ were held
to be important because they underlined the fact that it was not the term itself which
was excluded from assessment. Rather the term was excluded from certain forms of
assessment (namely on grounds of price/quality ratio) but it could be subject to
challenge on other grounds, for example on the ground that it was unfair because of its
other, discriminatory effects (see 
Abbey National
 
at [57]).
One difficulty with the decision in 
Abbey National
 
is that, as Lord Steyn pointed out in
First National Bank
 
(at [34]), ‘in a broad sense all terms of the contract are in some way
related to the price or remuneration’. Does this mean that the Supreme Court in 
Abbey
National
 
has in effect departed from its own decision in 
First National Bank
? The
formal answer is that it has not, but that the effect of 
Abbey National
 
was considerably
to limit the scope of the decision in 
First National Bank
. That the decision in 
First
National Bank
 
remains good law emerges from the following passage from the speech of
Lord Walker in 
Abbey National
 
(at [43]):
The House of Lords’ decision in the 
First National Bank
 
case shows that not every term that is in some way
linked to monetary consideration falls within regulation 6(2)(b) … But the relevant term in the 
First National
Bank
 
case was a default provision. Traders ought not to be able to outflank consumers by ‘drafting themselves’
into a position where they can take advantage of a default provision. But … the court can and will be astute to
prevent that. In the 
First National Bank
 
case Lord Steyn … indicated that what is now regulation 6(2) should be
construed restrictively, and Lord Bingham said … that it should be limited to terms ‘falling squarely within it’. I
respectfully agree. But in my opinion the relevant terms and the relevant charges do fall squarely within
regulation 6(2)(b).
While the words are consistent with the approach of the House of Lords in 
First
National Bank
, the spirit is not and it is possible that after 
Abbey National
 
the exclusion
will only apply to ‘default provisions’ or to terms which ‘require ancillary payments to be
made which are not part of the price or remuneration for goods or services to be
supplied under its terms’ (
Abbey National
 
at [113]).
What impact will the changes made to section 64(1)(b) have on the decisions in 
First
National Bank
 
and 
Abbey National
? The change from ‘adequacy’ to ‘appropriateness’ is
probably not a change of substance given that ‘adequacy’ has been held to mean
‘appropriateness or reasonableness (in amount)’ (
Office of Fair Trading
 
v. 
Abbey
National plc
 
[2009] UKSC 6, [2010] 1 AC 696, [94], per Lord Mance). Once again we
seem to be in the realms of a change of label rather than substance. It would therefore
appear that neither decision has been affected by the changes to section 64(1)(b) and
that the latter provision has not attempted to over-rule one or other decision. However,
at this point it is important to remember that terms are now only exempt from
assessment if they are ‘transparent and prominent’ (section 64(2)). To the extent that
these requirements are more exacting than the requirement that the term be in ‘plain
intelligible language’, it is possible that the terms that were in issue in 
Abbey National
would be subject to a more searching assessment.

A trader cannot by a term of a consumer contract or by a consumer notice
exclude or restrict liability for death or personal injury resulting from
negligence.
Where a term of a consumer contract, or a consumer notice, purports to
exclude or restrict a trader’s liability for negligence, a person is not to be
taken to have voluntarily accepted any risk merely because the person
agreed to or knew about the term or notice.
In this section ‘personal injury’ includes any disease and any impairment of
physical or mental condition.
In this section ‘negligence’ means the breach of—
any obligation to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill in
the performance of a contract where the obligation arises from an
express or implied term of the contract,
a common law duty to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable
skill,
the common duty of care imposed by the Occupiers’ Liability Act
1957 or the Occupiers’ Liability Act (Northern Ireland) 1957, or
the duty of reasonable care imposed by section 2(1) of the
Occupiers’ Liability (Scotland) Act 1960.
It is immaterial for the purposes of subsection (4)—
whether a breach of duty or obligation was inadvertent or intentional,
or
whether liability for it arises directly or vicariously.
This section is subject to section 66 (which makes provision about the
scope of this section).
66
 
Scope of section 65
Section 65 does not apply to—
any contract so far as it is a contract of insurance, including a
contract to pay an annuity on human life, or
any contract so far as it relates to the creation or transfer of an
(2)
(3)

(b)

interest in land.
Section 65 does not affect the validity of any discharge or indemnity given
by a person in consideration of the receipt by that person of compensation
in settlement of any claim the person has.
Section 65 does not—
apply to liability which is excluded or discharged as mentioned in
section 4(2)(a) (exception to liability to pay damages to relatives) of
the Damages (Scotland) Act 2011, or
affect the operation of section 5 (discharge of liability to pay
damages: exception for mesothelioma) of that Act.
Section 65 does not apply to the liability of an occupier of premises to a
person who obtains access to the premises for recreational purposes if—
the person suffers loss or damage because of the dangerous state
of the premises, and
allowing the person access for those purposes is not within the
purposes of the occupier’s trade, business, craft or profession.
Commentary
Sections 65
 
and 66 are the consumer equivalent of section 2(1) of the Unfair Contract
Terms Act (on which see 
13.3.2
) in so far as section 65(1) provides that a trader cannot
by a term of a consumer contract or by a consumer notice exclude or restrict liability for
death or personal injury resulting from negligence. There is therefore no need for a
court to consider whether or not such a term is fair: it is declared by statute to be a term
which does not have effect.

Effect of an unfair term on the rest of a contract
Where a term of a consumer contract is not binding on the consumer as a result of
this Part, the contract continues, so far as practicable, to have effect in every other
(1)
(2)
respect.
Commentary
It follows from this section that, in most cases, the contract will continue to bind the
parties with the exception of the unfair term. However, if the term is fundamental to the
contract and it is held to be unfair, the consequence may be that the contract will cease
to bind the parties on the basis that the contract is not capable of continuing in existence
without such a fundamental term.

Requirement for transparency
A trader must ensure that a written term of a consumer contract, or a
consumer notice in writing, is transparent.
A consumer notice is transparent for the purposes of subsection (1) if it is
expressed in plain and intelligible language and it is legible.
Commentary
This section only applies to written terms and it applies to all written terms, even to
those that specify the main subject matter of the contract or the appropriateness of the
price. Thus ‘core terms’ must be transparent. The insertion of the word ‘transparent’ is
new. Previously the requirement was that the term be expressed in ‘plain, intelligible
language’ (regulation 7(1) of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations
1999). But it can be seen that the requirement that the term be expressed in plain and
intelligible language has been incorporated into the requirement that the term be
‘transparent’ (section 68(2)). The change is therefore a change of label rather than
substance. The section does not formally state the consequence of a failure to ensure
that a written term is transparent. However, it is likely that a failure to ensure that the
term is transparent will be taken into account by the court when deciding whether or not
(1)
(2)
(1)
(2)
a term is unfair.
69
 
Contract terms that may have different meanings
If a term in a consumer contract, or a consumer notice, could have different
meanings, the meaning that is most favourable to the consumer is to
prevail.
Subsection (1) does not apply to the construction of a term or a notice in
proceedings on an application for an injunction or interdict under paragraph
3 of Schedule 3.
Commentary
Section 69 should be a familiar provision to English lawyers because 
contra
proferentem
 
is a general rule of construction in English law. According to this rule any
ambiguity in a term must be resolved against the party who is relying upon it. In so far
as section 69(1) provides that the consumer must be given the benefit of any doubt
about the meaning of a written term, it would appear to be no more than a statutory
form of the 
contra proferentem
 
rule.
70
 
Enforcement of the law on unfair contract terms
Schedule 3 confers functions on the Competition and Markets Authority and
other regulators in relation to the enforcement of this Part.
For provision about the investigatory powers that are available to those
regulators for the purposes of that Schedule, see Schedule 5.
Commentary
Schedule 3 sets out in some detail the duties and responsibilities of various regulators in
the enforcement of Part 2. This section and Schedule 3 are important because
consumers tend to be unwilling or unable to enforce their private law rights. A regulator
on the other hand is not so constrained and can therefore take steps which consumers
would not be able to take themselves in order to ensure that the legislation is effective in
practice. In the early days of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations the
role of regulator was played by the Office of Fair Trading and in particular by the Unfair
Contract Terms Unit of the Office of Fair Trading (see the extract from the article by
Professor Bright, on 
which see 
14.3
). The role of the principal regulator has now been
given to the Competition and Markets Authority (‘CMA’). However, the CMA is not the
sole regulator. Paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 to the 2015 Act contains the current list of
regulators. In addition to the CMA, the regulators now include the Department of
Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, a local weights and measures
authority in Great Britain, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Office of
Communications, the Information Commissioner, the Gas and Electricity Markets
Authority, the Water Services Regulation Authority, the Office of Rail and Road, the
Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation, and the Consumers’ Association. The
most notable inclusion in the list is the Consumers’ Association because it is not a public
body and so permits what is essentially a consumer advocacy group to play a role as
regulator under the Act. A regulator may consider a complaint about a term which is
alleged to be unfair. In order to ensure a degree of coordination between the possible
regulators, if a regulator other than the CMA intends to consider a relevant complaint, it
must first notify the CMA that it intends to do so, and must then consider the complaint.
If a regulator considers a complaint but decides not to make an application for an
injunction to restrain the continued use of the term, it must give reasons for the decision
to the person who made the complaint.
Regulators are given the power to apply to court for an injunction to restrain the
continued use of unfair terms (paragraph 3 of Schedule 3) and also have considerable
investigatory powers (see Schedule 5). Where a contract term is found to be unfair as a
result of a general challenge, a court not only has the power to prevent the use of the
unfair term in the future, it can also, in an appropriate case, prevent the seller or
supplier from continuing to enforce the term in current or existing contracts (
Office of
Fair Trading
 
v. 
Foxtons Ltd
 
[2009] EWCA Civ 288, [2010] 1 WLR 663). But it is
important to note that the failure of a general challenge does not mean that an
individual challenge will necessarily fail. If an individual can demonstrate that the term
(1)
(2)
(3)
is unfair in accordance with section 62, he or she is entitled to succeed with his or her
claim notwithstanding the fact that the term has survived a general challenge.
Supplementary provisions
71
 
Duty of court to consider fairness of term
Subsection (2) applies to proceedings before a court which relate to a term
of a consumer contract.
The court must consider whether the term is fair even if none of the parties
to the proceedings has raised that issue or indicated that it intends to raise
it.
But subsection (2) does not apply unless the court considers that it has
before it sufficient legal and factual material to enable it to consider the
fairness of the term.
Commentary
In most litigation involving issues of contract law, it is the responsibility of the parties to
put the relevant issues before the court. But, exceptionally, public policy may put the
onus on the court to raise the issue, so that it is not left to the parties to do so. This is
such a case and it will operate to benefit the consumer who was not aware that he or she
could challenge the contract term on the ground that it was unfair. However, the duty of
the court to raise 
the issue is not absolute: it depends upon the court having before it
sufficient legal and factual material to enable it to consider the fairness of the term. It is
unlikely that this section will be invoked frequently in practice. But on the (rare)
occasions on which it is invoked, it has the potential to ensure that justice is done in the
case where the consumer is unware of the existence of his or her right to challenge a
contract term.

Application of rules to secondary contracts

(4)
(1)
(a)
(b)
(2)
This section applies if a term of a contract (‘the secondary contract’)
reduces the rights or remedies or increases the obligations of a person
under another contract (‘the main contract’).
The term is subject to the provisions of this Part that would apply to the
term if it were in the main contract.
It does not matter for the purposes of this section—
whether the parties to the secondary contract are the same as the
parties to the main contract, or
whether the secondary contract is a consumer contract.
This section does not apply if the secondary contract is a settlement of a
claim arising under the main contract.
Commentary
Section 72 is the equivalent of section 10 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (on
which see 
13.3
). The purpose of the provision is to prevent the evasion of the protections
afforded by Part 2 by the creation of a secondary contract (whether or not that contract
is between the same parties) the effect of which would otherwise be to deprive the
consumer of his or her rights under Part 2.
73
 
Disapplication of rules to mandatory terms and notices
This Part does not apply to a term of a contract, or to a notice, to the extent
that it reflects—
mandatory statutory or regulatory provisions, or
the provisions or principles of an international convention to which
the United Kingdom is a party.
In subsection (1) ‘mandatory statutory or regulatory provisions’ includes
rules which, according to law, apply between the parties on the basis that
no other arrangements have been established.
(1)
Commentary
The intention behind this provision is to make clear that contract terms inserted into a
contract in order to give effect to a statutory requirement or an international convention
cannot be challenged under the Act. The wording chosen to give effect to this policy is,
however, rather unusual. The first point relates to the meaning of the word ‘mandatory’.
It would appear that it does not mean ‘mandatory’ in the sense of a rule of law out of
which the parties cannot 
contract. Recital 13 to the Directive states that the words
‘mandatory statutory or regulatory provisions’ also ‘cover[] rules which, according to the
law, shall apply between the contracting parties provided that no other arrangements
have been established’. The latter appear to be ‘default’ rules rather than ‘mandatory’
rules and, this being the case, the word ‘mandatory’ in the Act appears misleading and
possibly redundant. It would appear to suffice that the term in question is permitted or
authorized by statute: it need not be required by statute. However, it does not extend to
a term that was initially freely made by the parties but was then extended as a result of a
statutory mechanism. The extension of the term by legislation does not take a term that
would otherwise have been within the Act beyond its reach (
Roundlistic Ltd
 
v. 
Jones
[2018] EWCA Civ 2284, [2019] 1 WLR 4461). Secondly, the word ‘reflects’ is rather
vague. But it may be important. Take the case of a regulator who approves contract
terms while acting in the course of a statutory jurisdiction. Is such a term exempt from
the Act? The term itself is not ‘authorised’ by the statute but the Directive in Recital 13
refers to ‘statutory or regulatory provisions … which directly or indirectly determine the
terms of consumer contracts’ and the reference to indirect authorization may be
sufficient to catch our regulator example. Finally, the word ‘principles’ in section 73(1)
(b) has given rise to some difficulty. Although the point is not free from doubt, it is
suggested that the mere fact that the term reflects an international convention should
not suffice to take it outside the scope of the Act where the relevant convention does not
apply to the contract that has been concluded between the parties.

Contracts applying law of a country other than the UK
If—
(a)
(b)
(2)
the law of a country or territory other than the United Kingdom or
any part of the United Kingdom is chosen by the parties to be
applicable to a consumer contract, but
the consumer contract has a close connection with the United
Kingdom,
this Part applies despite that choice.
For cases where the law applicable has not been chosen, see Regulation
(EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17
June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations as that
Regulation has effect as retained direct EU legislation (including that
Regulation as applied by regulation 5 of the Law Applicable to Contractual
Obligations (England and Wales and Northern Ireland) Regulations 2009
and regulation 4 of the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (Scotland)
Regulations 2009), unless the case is one in respect of which Regulation
(EC) No 593/2008 has effect by virtue of Article 66 of the EU withdrawal
agreement, in which case see that Regulation as it has effect by virtue of
that Article.
Commentary
The aim of this provision is to prevent traders avoiding the application of the Act by
inserting a choice of law clause into the contract. Take the case where a trader inserts
into its standard form contract a choice of law clause and the law chosen is the law of an
African or a South American country. Such a choice of law is not effective where the
consumer contract has a close connection with the United Kingdom.

Commentary
Schedule 4 contains a number of amendments to other legislation, such as the Unfair
Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Misrepresentation Act 1967, which are required in
order to give effect to the changes which have been made by Part 2. These changes to the
Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Misrepresentation Act 1967 have been
incorporated into 
chapters 13
 
and 
17
 
respectively.

Interpretation of Part 2
In this Part— 
‘consumer contract’ has the meaning given by section 61(3); 
‘consumer notice’ has the meaning given by section 61(7); 
‘transparent’ is to be construed in accordance with sections 64(3) and
68(2).
The following have the same meanings in this Part as they have in Part 1—
‘trader’ (see section 2(2)); 
‘consumer’ (see section 2(3)); 
‘goods’ (see section 2(8)); 
‘digital content’ (see section 2(9)).
Section 2(4) (trader who claims an individual is not a consumer must prove
it) applies in relation to this Part as it applies in relation to Part 1.
Commentary
These definitions have been incorporated into the discussion of the relevant sections.

Part 2 Scope of Part 1
Financial services

—
the supplier is required to inform the consumer of the alteration at
the earliest opportunity, and
the consumer is free to dissolve the contract immediately.

Commentary
Part 1 of Schedule 2 contains the so-called ‘grey list’ of terms that may be regarded as
unfair. As has been noted (earlier in this section), there is some uncertainty as to
whether the list is for guidance only or whether it creates a rebuttable presumption that
a term included in 
the list is unfair. Whatever its precise legal status, it is clear that Part
1 of Schedule 2 plays an important role when deciding whether or not a particular term
is unfair. It is therefore necessary to explain, albeit briefly, the likely scope of the
different paragraphs set out in this Schedule. Most of the paragraphs were in the
original Regulations but three new additions (paragraphs 5, 12, and 14) were added by
the Consumer Rights Act.
Paragraph 1 applies to terms that purport to exclude or limit the trader’s liability for
death or personal injury. Where the death or personal injury is a consequence of the
negligence of the trader, then the term is regulated by section 65 and will not be given
effect. Therefore, this paragraph is confined to cases where the death or personal injury
results from a non-negligent act or omission of the trader.
Paragraph 2 has wide potential application, yet its scope is uncertain. There is no
definition of ‘inappropriately’, notwithstanding its importance to the paragraph as a
whole. The paragraph appears to be in the nature of a wrap-up or catch-all provision.
Paragraph 3 applies to conditional service provisions. Terms which purport to bind one
party to the contract before binding the other may now be unfair. What will be the effect
of a finding that such a term is unfair? It will not be binding on the consumer (section
62(1)). But will the contract continue to bind the parties? One possibility is that the
invalidity of the term will have the effect of making the contract binding on both parties
to the contract from the same point in time. This paragraph will have considerable
impact on hire-purchase transactions and leasing agreements, where it was not
uncommon for the contract to provide for the consumer to be bound before the trader
was bound to the transaction.
Paragraph 4 applies to deposits. Attempts by traders to retain deposits are already
regulated by the common law (see 
23.12
) and, in the case of consumer contracts, by the
Consumer Credit Act 1974. The novelty in this particular provision is the requirement
that the consumer receive equal protection through being entitled to compensation of an
‘equivalent amount’ from the trader in the event of the trader cancelling the contract. It
has been stated (Treitel, 
The Law of Contract
 
(15th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited
by Edwin Peel), paragraph 20–177) that this provision is based on ‘the civil law
institution (which has no counterparty in the common law) by which a contract can, in
effect, be dissolved on forfeiture of a deposit or on the return by the payee of double the
amount’. It is also suggested that the consumer will have the right to the return of any
sum paid on the basis that the use of the word ‘retain’ suggests the availability of a
remedy for the recovery of the pre-payment. Finally, Treitel notes (paragraph 20–177)
that the paragraph does not apply to rights of forfeiture conferred by law, the scope of
the Act being confined to ‘contract terms’.
Paragraph 5 is a new addition, which was inserted for the first time in the 2015 Act. It
extends protection to the consumer who decides not to conclude or perform the contract
and who is required to pay to the trader a disproportionately high sum in compensation
or for services which have not been supplied. In the case of the consumer who has not
performed the contract, such non-performance may be a breach of contract and so the
paragraph would appear to overlap with the penalty clause rule. But to the extent that it
applies to the consumer who decides not to conclude the contract, it would appear that
this protection is over and above that to be found in the existing common law.
Paragraph 6 overlaps with the existing common law rules relating to penalty clauses
(which are discussed at 
23.11
), but it is not clear to what extent, if at all, this paragraph
differs from the common law rules and the courts may draw upon the common law rules
when seeking to interpret this provision (see, for example, 
ParkingEye Ltd
 
v. 
Beavis
[2015] UKSC 67, [2016] AC 1172, where some of the factors taken into account by the
Supreme Court in deciding that the term was not unfair were similar to those considered
when deciding that the 
clause was not a penalty clause). The word ‘disproportionately’ is
not defined. At what time is the disproportion to be assessed: is it the time of formation
or the time of breach? This paragraph may be wider than the penalty clause rules
because the Act may not be confined to sums payable on breach: a consumer who ‘fails
to fulfil his obligation’ might not be in breach of contract because he may have an excuse
for his non-performance. It may also catch a clause requiring payment of a holding
charge, of the type used in 
Interfoto Picture Library Ltd
 
v. 
Stiletto Visual Programmes
Ltd
 
[1989] QB 433 (see 
9.3
).
Paragraph 7 is likely to have considerable impact because many traders give themselves
the right to dissolve the contract where the consumer does not have the same right. Such
a term may now be unfair unless it gives the consumer an identical right to dissolve the
contract. The latter part of the paragraph overlaps with paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 but this
paragraph only applies to the retention of sums paid for ‘services not yet supplied’.
The subject matter of paragraph 8 is terms which purport to entitle a trader to terminate
a contract without notice. There are three critical phrases in this provision: (i)
‘indeterminate duration’, (ii) ‘reasonable notice’, and (iii) ‘serious grounds’. None of
these phrases is defined. Treitel points out (paragraph 18–082) that the fact that the
Schedule is non-exhaustive ‘would not preclude the court from holding that a
cancellation clause in a fixed-term contract was also unfair’. The reference to ‘serious
grounds’ may catch force majeure clauses which purport to bind consumers. The scope
of this paragraph is limited by paragraphs 21 and 24 of Part 2 of Schedule 2, which make
particular provision for the financial services industry.
Paragraph 9 applies to terms which purport to give to traders the right unilaterally to
extend contracts of fixed duration and will probably have the greatest impact on long-
term hire contracts. In this way the legislation appears to introduce a test of fairness into
the renewal period for certain contracts. This paragraph may also catch a holding-fee of
the type used in 
Interfoto Picture Library Ltd
 
v. 
Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd
 
[1989]
QB 433 (see 
9.3
). The effect of a finding that such a term is unfair will be that it is not
binding on the consumer so that the contract will not be extended in the manner
contemplated by the term.
Paragraph 10 is important, albeit that its scope is rather unclear. It applies to a contract
term which purports to incorporate the terms of other documents not accessible to the
consumer. But it does not appear to challenge the rule in 
L’Estrange
 
v. 
Graucob
 
[1934]
2 KB 394 (see 
9.2
) because the subject matter of this paragraph is the term which seeks
to incorporate the other terms into the contract rather than the term which it is sought
to incorporate into the contract.
Paragraph 11 applies to unilateral alteration clauses. The scope of this paragraph is
limited by paragraphs 22, 23, and 24 of Part 2 of Schedule 2 which make particular
provision for the financial services industry. Paragraph 23 provides that a trader can
reserve the right unilaterally to alter the conditions of a contract of indeterminate
duration, provided that he is required to inform the consumer with reasonable notice
and that the consumer is free to dissolve the contract.
Paragraph 12 is another new addition and in many ways it can be said to supplement
paragraph 11 in so far as it also applies to unilateral alteration clauses, although this
time the alteration is one that relates to the characteristics of the subject matter of the
contract. So, for example, where the seller of goods reserves the right, after the
conclusion of the contract of sale, to alter the characteristics of the goods that are the
subject of the contract of sale.
Paragraph 13 applies to terms which enable the trader to alter without a valid reason any
characteristics of the goods, digital content, or services to be provided. This paragraph
only applies where the trader does not have a ‘valid reason’ for making the alteration.
‘Valid reason’ is not defined in the Act.
Paragraph 14 is the final new provision which has been inserted into the 2015 Act and it
deals with the case where the price or the method of determining the price has not been
agreed when the consumer became bound by the contract and the term confers a
discretion upon the trader to decide the price payable under the contract. The consumer
in such a case is not left to the mercy of the trader but may be able to challenge the term
conferring such a discretion upon the trader.
Paragraph 15 applies to terms which purport to entitle the trader to make unilateral
changes to the price of goods, digital content, or services. Thus, while the adequacy of
the price cannot be challenged as an unfair term provided that it is transparent and
prominent (see section 64(2)), the same cannot be said of terms which purport to entitle
one party to make changes to the agreed price of the goods, digital content, or services.
Such terms are susceptible to challenge under the Act. It is not entirely clear what will
happen in the event that such a term is found to be unfair. While the term will not bind
the consumer, what price will be payable for the goods, digital content, or services? Is
there no contract, a contract to pay for the goods, digital content, or services at a
‘reasonable price’, or a contract to pay for the goods, digital content, or services at the
originally agreed price? The scope of this paragraph is also limited by paragraphs 24 and
25 of Part 2 to Schedule 2. The former makes special provision for the financial services
industry, while the latter states that paragraph 15 is without hindrance to price
indexation clauses, where lawful, provided that the method by which prices vary is
‘explicitly’ described. In other words, the emphasis is placed on the clarity and quality of
the information given in relation to the price index.
Paragraph 16 catches unilateral interpretation terms. It is not unknown for traders to
attempt to confer upon themselves the entitlement to determine whether or not they
have complied with their own obligations under the contract. Terms which purport to
confer such a right (or a right of exclusive interpretation) fall within the scope of this
paragraph.
Paragraph 17 applies to formality requirements. This paragraph would appear not to
apply to exclusion clauses because it opens with the word ‘limiting’. On the other hand,
the fact that the list does not purport to be exhaustive may enable a court to conclude
that an exclusion clause cast in these terms is also unfair.
Paragraph 18 applies to terms obliging the consumer to fulfil all of his obligations where
the trader does not perform his. This paragraph could apply to a rental agreement under
which the hirer is obliged to pay the hire, when the owner is not under an obligation to
repair the goods hired.
Paragraph 19 applies to a term which purports to entitle the trader to transfer his rights
and obligations under the contract and the effect of this is to reduce the guarantees for
the consumer without the consumer’s consent. The reference to the transfer of
obligations in this paragraph is a little puzzling to an English lawyer because English law
does not allow one party to transfer his obligations under a contract to a third party
without the consent of his contracting party. This being the case, an attempt by a seller
to transfer his obligations to a third party without the consent of the consumer would be
invalid irrespective of this particular provision.
Paragraph 20 applies to terms which seek to restrict the availability of legal remedies.
Treitel (paragraph 7–115) analyses this provision in the following terms:
Terms ‘excluding or hindering’ the consumer’s right to take legal action or exercise any other legal remedy are
included in the list of prima facie unfair terms. In this context, the list refers, in particular, to terms ‘requiring
the consumer to take disputes exclusively to arbitration not 
covered by legal provisions’ … The reference to
arbitration clauses … is, however, restricted by the words ‘not covered by legal provisions’ and the purpose of
this restriction may be to narrow the category of prima facie unfair arbitration clauses to those in which the
parties have agreed to exclude the powers of the courts to control the arbitrator’s decision.
 
Schedule 2 to the 1994 Regulations was not re-enacted in either the 1999 Regulations or the 2015 Act. Schedule 2
provided that, in making an assessment of good faith, regard shall be had in particular to (a) the strength of the
bargaining positions of the parties; (b) whether the consumer had an inducement to agree to the term; (c) whether the
goods or services were sold or supplied to the special order of the consumer; and (d) the extent to which the seller or
supplier has dealt fairly and equitably with the consumer.
 
As noted, this Schedule was not re-enacted in the 1999 Regulations or the 2015 Act.

Enforcement
As has been noted, the primary role in the enforcement of the Regulations was played
initially not by the courts but by the Unfair Contract Terms Unit of the Office of Fair
Trading. As has been noted, that role has now been assumed by the Competition and
Markets Authority. Although the regulator has now changed, the following assessment
of the role of the Unfair Contract Terms unit remains of interest:

Enforcement of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts
Regulations
Although the UK Regulations can be relied on in private law disputes involving
consumers, it is the Unfair Contract Terms Unit that has been at the forefront of
action against unfair contract terms. Private law enforcement does not provide an
effective way of regulating the standard inclusion of unfair terms in adhesion
contracts: it is true that success in an individual action will mean that the term is
not binding upon that consumer, but its impact beyond that consumer will be
limited, and there is no significant pressure on the business to discontinue future
use of that term. Further, there will only ever be a trickle of private law actions as
most consumers prefer to deal with matters informally, or not at all, rather than
pursue complaints by formal legal mechanisms in which the costs of litigation
(financial and otherwise) exceed the benefits that stand to be achieved. So far
there has only been a handful of cases in which the consumer has, with mixed
success, relied upon the 1994 Regulations.
The administrative model of enforcement created by the 1994 Regulations (and
extended by the 1999 Regulations) is a much more effective way of preventing the
continuing use of unfair terms and changing contracting practice. Investigation into
allegedly unfair terms usually follows a complaint made to the Director General of
Fair Trading, who is under a duty to investigate unless it is ‘frivolous or vexatious’.
There is a strong flow of complaints made to the Unfair Contract Terms Unit, about
half of which come from local authority trading standards departments and
consumer advice organisations. The Unit have adopted a pro-active response to
complaints; not only will the particular term complained about be looked into, but
the contract as a whole will be investigated. Indeed, investigations often spread
beyond the particular contract to involve trade associations, and the Unit has
initiated a number of sectoral investigations so that contracts used by traders in a
similar line of business can be looked at together. So, for example, there has been
notable success in securing the amendment of terms in mobile phone contracts,
the sector about which there has been most complaint. By way of illustration,
numerous amendments were agreed in relation to Vodafone contracts, including
adjustment of the notice requirement (which had required three months’ notice
additional to the minimum twelve month term), deletion of a clause providing for a
substantial disconnection charge, and a reduction in the level of compensation
payable by 
a consumer who terminates early. Other sectors which have been
focused upon include the home improvement industry, vehicle rental, package
holidays and, most recently, the Director General of Fair Trading has announced
that he is investigating conditions of airline use. Discussions with trade
associations are not always a response to complaints and may be on the initiative
of the Office of Fair Trading.
In practice, the vast majority of cases are dealt with by negotiation and if the
contract term is found to be unfair the Unfair Contract Terms Unit will require the
business to provide an undertaking to discontinue the use of the unfair term. Court
action has been seen as a last resort. … It is interesting to speculate just why this
course of action has been so successful and why traders have, with varying
degrees of willingness, complied with the requests to abandon or amend terms
without forcing the issue to court. Presumably the fear of bad publicity plays a part.
There is also the fact that many of the terms are fair in part—by rewriting them the
trader can still secure the protection needed whilst also being fair to the consumer;
if left unamended the terms may be wholly unenforceable against the consumer.
Dealing with trade associations is also an efficient way of reaching businesses: as
the representative figure within that sectoral activity, associations will often be
anxious to present a positive public image and to maintain good working
relationships with the Office of Fair Trading. Agreements reached at this level will
be passed through to the trading bodies who use the association’s standard
contract. By way of example, the Office of Fair Trading agreed a revised model
contract for use by members of The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing
Association. About 85% of companies in this industry belong to this association. It
is also less costly to proceed by way of undertaking than by paying the costs of
going to court. However, what has been the practice over the last five years will not
necessarily be the pattern of the future; if it emerges over time that the courts
adopt a less consumer-oriented interpretation of the Regulations, there is the
possibility that fewer cases will be settled by negotiation alone.
This administrative model of enforcement was not prescribed by the Directive.
Although the Directive specifies that mechanisms must be in place to prevent the
continued use of unfair terms in consumer contracts, the method deployed to
achieve this end is left to Member States. States could therefore select not only to
hand this role to a public official (as in the United Kingdom and in Nordic
countries), but to permit consumer organisations to bring actions to prevent the
continued use of unfair terms (as in Germany and France), or (possibly) to use
criminal sanctions. The route chosen in the United Kingdom has proven effective,
as already seen, but there were complaints that the 1994 Regulations failed to give
a voice to consumer organisations. Article 7 of the Unfair Terms Directive requires
Member States to ensure that ‘adequate and effective means exist to prevent the
continued use of unfair terms’ and that the means shall ‘include provisions
whereby persons or organisations, having a legitimate interest under national law
in protecting consumers’ may take action to have terms declared unfair. In 1995,
the Consumers’ Association sought to have the exclusion of bodies such as theirs
declared to be an unlawful implementation of the Directive. The judge, Hidden J,
referred the question raised by the Consumers’ Association’s action to the
European Court of Justice for a ruling on the Community law, but the point was
never pursued as the UK government announced its intention to address their
concerns through an amendment to the 1994 Regulations.
There are various models that could have been used to extend the
enforcement powers beyond the Director General of Fair Trading. The approach
adopted in the 1999 Regulations is to list additional specific bodies (statutory
regulators, trading standards departments and the Consumers’ Association) as
having powers to apply for an injunction to prevent the continued use of unfair
terms. With the exception of the Consumers’ Association, these 
bodies can also
notify the Director General of Fair Trading that they will investigate a complaint,
and will then be under an obligation to do so. An alternative model would have
been to facilitate action by any body that is able to show that it fulfils certain criteria
—depending upon the criteria selected, this would have enabled organisations
such as the National Consumers’ Council, Citizens’ Advice Bureaux and the
Financial Services Authority, to apply to bring actions. This route was the preferred
approach of the Department of Trade and Industry in its Consultation Paper, which
set out at some length the criteria that could be used by a court in deciding
whether or not to recognise bodies. Nevertheless, this route proved to be
impractical. It entailed the risk of wasted expenses for traders, who could be put to
the trouble and expense of defending claims from bodies who might later turn out
not to fulfil the specified criteria. Implementation would also have necessitated
changes to the rules of court, which would have generated further delay. There is a
risk, however, that having selected the list approach, non-listed bodies might bring
fresh challenges. Although the emphasis of the Consumers’ Association case lay in
the claim that it was unlawful to have empowered only one public body to bring
actions, there must be some doubt as to whether it is within the Directive to deny
this option to any body which can show that it has a ‘legitimate interest under
national law in protecting consumers’ (Article 7). It is likely, however, that there will
be a second wave of listing: the Department of Trade and Industry have invited
consumer bodies who wish to have enforcement powers under the Regulations to
contact them.
The extension of powers beyond the Director General of Fair Trading meant
that measures had to be put in place to ensure that there would be consistent
approaches taken to unfair terms, effective co-ordination between the enforcement
bodies, and to protect traders from multiple challenges. To this end, if a qualifying
body intends to apply for an injunction, it must give the Director General of Fair
Trading notice and then, unless a shorter period is authorised, cannot commence
the action within fourteen days. In addition, the qualifying body must inform the
Director General of Fair Trading of all undertakings it receives and of the result of
any applications for an injunction. The fact that there is only a small number of
bodies authorised to act does minimise the risk of a trader being in negotiation with
several ‘enforcers’. The Director General of Fair Trading will remain the primary
investigator and, as all investigations have to be reported to him, he will have an
overview of all complaints. He retains a duty to disseminate information about the
operation of the Regulations, not only about his own actions but also reporting on
undertakings given to, and actions brought by, other qualifying bodies. In practice,
dissemination has taken place through the issue of regular bulletins containing
details of case reports, coupled with press releases reporting significant ‘triumphs’.
It is anticipated that the widening of the enforcement provisions, and the ability
to apply for injunctive relief in the County Court, will increase the number of cases
taken to court. This may well impact upon the application of the Regulations. To
date, the Office of Fair Trading has largely operated with a free hand, exercising a
wide discretion to apply the Regulations in the interests of consumers. Judicial
intervention may impose more checks and balances into their application. …
Although the Office of Fair Trading has largely operated in isolation, the source of
the Regulations lies in the European Unfair Terms Directive. Questions of
interpretation will ultimately be for the European Court of Justice, but it is unlikely
that vast numbers of cases will be referred. Much of the wording of the Directive is
based upon Continental notions and yet there is no obvious procedure in place to
facilitate the sharing of experiences between Member States … if the Directive is
to lead to a more harmonised approach towards unfair terms in consumer
contracts there needs to be a regular mechanism to ensure a consistency of
approach, such as an advisory panel, spearheaded by the Directorate responsible
for consumer affairs, DG XXIV.
Commentary
There are at least three important lessons that we can learn from this extract. The first is
that it is a mistake to focus too much attention on the courts and to assume that if there
is no case-law then the legislation cannot be working. The real enforcement of the
Regulations did not take place in the courts but in the Office of Fair Trading. The second
point to note is the importance of administrative regulation to the enforcement of the
legislation. As Professor Bright observes, ‘private law enforcement does not provide an
effective way of regulating the standard inclusion of unfair terms in adhesion contracts.’
The third point is that the extension of enforcement powers beyond the Office of Fair
Trading (and now the Competition and Markets Authority) may not necessarily operate
in the interests of consumers. Much will depend on the ability of these different
qualifying bodies to forge a coherent and effective enforcement strategy.

Good Faith
Central Issues
While English contract law is influenced by notions of good faith, it
does not, as yet, recognize the existence of a general doctrine of good
faith. In this respect English law stands out from many other legal
systems in the world.
The fact that English law does not recognize a doctrine of good faith
does not mean that the rules of contract law do not generally conform
with the requirements of good faith. It would be surprising if the rules
encouraged parties to behave in bad faith. The difference between
English law and other legal systems is in some ways one of legal form
rather than substance. Conclusions that would be reached in other
legal systems by invocation of the doctrine of good faith can be
reached in other ways by the English courts.
However, now that good faith is taken into account when considering
whether a term in a consumer contract constitutes an unfair term (see
Chapter 14
), the question has arisen whether the influence of good
faith will extend beyond the scope of the legislation and percolate into
other areas of contract law (particularly commercial contracts). In
many ways there is no reason why it should. But there are some signs
of a change in both judicial and academic attitudes to good faith.
Hostility or scepticism is being replaced by greater receptiveness.
This being the case, English contract law may yet develop in the
direction of recognizing a duty of good faith, at least in the
performance of contracts.
It is therefore necessary to examine the arguments both for and
against the introduction of a doctrine of good faith into English law
and to consider the different forms that such a doctrine might assume.
15.1
 
Introduction
The requirement of good faith having been introduced into English law in relation to
consumer contracts, first by the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994
(SI 1994/3159) and now by Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (see 
14.2
), raises for
consideration the issue of whether good faith should be confined to this particular
context and type of contract or whether it is of more general application and has a
greater role to play in the modern English law of contract. When the Regulations were
first enacted in 1994 the good faith requirement excited a considerable amount of
interest among English contract lawyers because English law did not then recognize a
doctrine of good faith in contract law. In the absence of such a general doctrine, how
would the English courts interpret the good faith requirement in the Regulations? As it
has turned out, the courts do not seem to have experienced any particular difficulty in
giving effect to the good faith requirement. They have recognized its European origins
and have not sought to interpret it from a national perspective. At first instance in
Director General of Fair Trading
 
v. 
First National Bank
 
[2000] 1 WLR 98, 109 Evans-
Lombe J, after noting that the origin of the Regulations is a Council Directive, stated:
[I]t is clear, therefore, that the words ‘good faith’ are not to be construed in the English sense of absence of
dishonesty but rather in the continental civil law sense.
In the Court of Appeal Peter Gibson LJ stated ([2000] QB 672, 687) that ‘“good faith”
has a special meaning in the Regulations, having its conceptual roots in civil law
systems’. Drawing on 
Anson’s Law of Contract
 
(27th edn, Oxford University Press,
1998), p. 293 he stated that the ‘good faith’ element:
seeks to promote fair and open dealing, and to prevent unfair surprise and the absence of real choice. A term to
which the consumer’s attention is not specifically drawn but which may operate in a way which the consumer
might reasonably not expect and to his disadvantage may offend the requirement of good faith. Terms must be
reasonably transparent and should not operate to defeat the reasonable expectations of the consumer. The
consumer in choosing whether to enter into a contract should be put in a position where he can make an
informed choice.
In the House of Lords ([2001] UKHL 52, [2002] 1 AC 481) both Lord Bingham (at [17])
and Lord Steyn (at [36]) recognized that good faith is an ‘objective criterion’ which
imports the ‘notion of fair and open dealing’. Two further points should be noted from
the speech of Lord Bingham. The first is his observation that the Member States of the
European Union ‘have no common concept of fairness or good faith’. This is an
important point. While civil law systems do recognize a doctrine of good faith, their
conception of good faith is not homogeneous. The second point that should be noted is
Lord Bingham’s remark that good faith is not a concept that is ‘wholly unfamiliar to
British lawyers’. Good faith had its ‘champion’ in Lord Mansfield in the eighteenth
century and traces of his support for good faith are still to be found in English law
(particularly in relation to insurance contracts). These two observations suggest that
care should be taken when comparing English law with the law of our civilian
counterparts. They suggest that the stark contrast that is often drawn between the
common law and the civil law can be overstated both because the civil law systems are
not themselves united, at least in relation to their conception of good faith, and because
good faith is not in fact an unknown commodity to common lawyers.
Nevertheless, the requirement of good faith as enacted in the Regulations (and now in
Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015) does present an important challenge to English
lawyers and judges. It forces them to talk openly about good faith and, once they
articulate a conception of good faith, the question will arise for consideration whether it
should 
be confined to the particular context of the applicable legislation or whether its
influence should extend more broadly. There is no immediate reason why Part 2 of the
Consumer Rights Act 2015 should lead to the recognition of a general doctrine of good
faith. Part 2 of the Act is not of general application. It only applies to consumer contracts
that fall within its scope. But this does not mean that the legislation will not have a wider
influence on the development of English law. Many commentators have argued that
English law should recognize a doctrine of good faith and there are signs that current
members of the judiciary are more receptive to the idea that good faith should have a
role to play in English contract law. There is, however, a difficulty. That difficulty is the
decision of the House of Lords in 
Walford
 
v. 
Miles
 
[1992] 2 AC 128, in which it was held
that English law did not recognize the validity of an obligation to negotiate in good faith.
Any recognition of a general doctrine of good faith would require re-consideration of the
decision in 
Walford
 
and its scope and that can only be done by the Supreme Court. It is
also far from clear that the Supreme Court will take the step of recognising a general
doctrine of good faith. In its most recent pronouncement on the matter, Lord Hodge,
giving the judgment of the majority of the court, affirmed that there is ‘no general
principle of good faith in contracting in English law’ (
Pakistan International Airline
Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK) Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3 WLR 717, [44]). This
statement is unlikely to be the last word on the matter, given that the question of
whether or not English law should recognize a general doctrine of good faith was not in
issue before the Supreme Court, but it does recognize the continued reluctance of
English law to embrace a general doctrine of good faith.
We shall therefore start with the decision in 
Walford
. It is necessary both to examine the
reasons that led to the decision and also to explore its limits. Having done that we shall
then consider the arguments that have been advanced in support of the refusal of
English law to recognize the validity of a doctrine of good faith and then turn to the
arguments that have been advanced by those who support the recognition of a doctrine
of good faith.

Walford
 
v. 
Miles
The leading English case on good faith is the decision of the House of Lords in 
Walford
v. 
Miles
 
[1992] 2 AC 128, where it was held that an obligation to negotiate in good faith
is not enforceable.
WALFORD V. MILES
[1992] 2 AC 128, House of Lords
The defendants, Mr and Mrs Miles, were the owners of a company, PNM
Laboratories Ltd. They decided to put the company up for sale in 1986. A third
party offered £1.9 million for the business and its premises. The plaintiffs, the
Walfords, entered into negotiations with the defendants in March 1987. The
defendants were prepared to warrant that at the date of completion the cash
resources in the company’s bank account would not be less than £1 million and
that the trading profits for the 12 months after completion would be not less than
£300,000 before tax. On 12 March 1987 the parties reached agreement in principle
for the sale of the business. On 18 March the plaintiffs sent a letter to the
defendants which recorded an agreement reached between the parties the
previous day. The letter recorded that the plaintiffs had promised to provide a
comfort letter from their bank which confirmed 
that they were prepared to provide
the finance of £2 million in order to enable the plaintiffs to acquire the company. In
return the defendants agreed that if they received a letter from the bank to this
effect by the end of the week they would terminate negotiations with any third party
with a view to concluding an agreement with the plaintiffs. On 18 March the
plaintiffs’ bank duly provided a letter which stated that it had offered the plaintiffs
loan facilities to enable them to acquire the company for £2 million. On 25 March
the defendants confirmed that, subject to contract, they were prepared to sell the
company to the plaintiffs for £2 million. On 30 March a letter was written to the
plaintiffs on behalf of the defendants which stated that they had decided to sell the
company to a third party.
The plaintiffs brought an action against the defendants for damages for breach
of contract. They claimed damages of £1 million (on the basis that they had lost the
opportunity to purchase a company worth £3 million for £2 million) and they also
claimed damages for misrepresentation by the defendants in continuing to deal
with third parties. The trial judge awarded the plaintiffs damages of £700 in respect
of the misrepresentations made by the defendants. In relation to the claim for
breach of contract, the trial judge ordered that damages for the alleged loss of
opportunity be assessed but the Court of Appeal allowed the defendants’ appeal.
The plaintiffs appealed to the House of Lords where it was held that the agreement
recorded in the defendants’ letter of 18 March was unenforceable.
Lord Ackner
The Walfords relied upon an oral agreement, collateral to the negotiations which
were proceeding, to purchase the company and the land it occupied ‘subject to
contract’. The consideration for this oral agreement was twofold—firstly the
Walfords agreeing to continue the negotiations and not to withdraw and, secondly,
their providing the comfort letter from their bankers in the terms requested.
For this consideration it was alleged in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim as
follows:
‘the first defendant on behalf of himself and the second defendant would terminate negotiations with any
third party or consideration of any alternative with a view to concluding an agreement with the Plaintiffs
and further that even if he received a satisfactory proposal from any third party prior to the close of
business on 25 March 1987, he would not deal with that third party or give further consideration to any
alternative.’
As thus pleaded, the agreement purported to be what is known as a ‘lock-out’
agreement, providing the plaintiffs with an exclusive opportunity to try and come to
terms with the defendants, but without expressly providing any duration for such an
opportunity.
For reasons which will become apparent hereafter, it was decided to amend
this paragraph by the following addition:
‘It was a term of the said collateral agreement necessarily to be implied to give business efficacy thereto
that, so long as they continued to desire to sell the said property and shares, the first defendant on
behalf of himself and the second defendant would 
continue to negotiate in good faith with the plaintiff.’
Thus the statement of claim alleged that, not only were the defendants ‘locked-out’
for some unspecified time from dealing with any third party, but were ‘locked-in’ to
dealing with the plaintiffs, also for an unspecified period …
The validity of the agreement alleged in paragraph 5 of the
statement of claim as amended
The justification for the implied term in paragraph 5 of the amended statement of
claim was that in order to give the collateral agreement ‘business efficacy’, Mr
Miles was obliged to ‘continue to negotiate in good faith’. It was submitted to the
Court of Appeal and initially to your Lordships that this collateral agreement could
not be made to work, unless there was a positive duty imposed upon Mr Miles to
negotiate. It was of course conceded that the agreement made no specific
provision for the period it was to last. It was however contended, albeit not
pleaded, that the obligation to negotiate would endure for a reasonable time, and
that such time was the time which was reasonably necessary to reach a binding
agreement. It was however accepted that such period of time would not end when
negotiations had ceased, because all such negotiations were conducted expressly
under the umbrella of ‘subject to contract’. The agreement alleged would thus be
valueless if the alleged obligation to negotiate ended when negotiations as to the
terms of the ‘subject to contract’ agreement had ended, since at that stage the
Miles would have been entitled at their whim to refuse to sign any contract.
Apart from the absence of any term as to the duration of the collateral
agreement, it contained no provision for the Miles to determine the negotiations,
albeit that such a provision was essential. It was contended by Mr Naughton
[counsel for the plaintiffs] that a term was to be implied giving the Miles a right to
determine the negotiations, but only if they had ‘a proper reason’. However in order
to determine whether a given reason was a proper one, he accepted that the test
was not an objective one—would a hypothetical reasonable person consider the
reason a reasonable one? The test was a subjective one—did the Miles honestly
believe in the reason which they gave for the termination of the negotiations? Thus
they could be quite irrational, so long as they behaved honestly.
Mr Naughton accepted that as the law now stands and has stood for
approaching 20 years, an agreement to negotiate is not recognised as an
enforceable contract. This was first decided in terms in 
Courtney & Fairbairn Ltd
 
v.
Tolaini Brothers (Hotels) Ltd
 
[1975] 1 WLR 297, where Lord Denning MR said, at
pp. 301–302:
‘If the law does not recognise a contract to enter into a contract (when there is a fundamental term yet to
be agreed) it seems to me it cannot recognise a contract to negotiate. The reason is because it is too
uncertain to have any binding force … It seems to me that a contract to negotiate, like a contract to enter
into a contract, is not a contract known to the law … I think we must apply the general principle that
where there is a fundamental matter left undecided and to be the subject of negotiation, there is no
contract.’
The decision that an agreement to negotiate cannot constitute a legally
enforceable contract has been followed at first instance in a number of relatively
recent cases …
[He set out the cases and continued]
In the Court of Appeal and before your Lordships Mr Naughton submitted that
[
Courtney & Fairbairn Ltd
 
v. 
Tolaini Brothers
 
and 
Mallozzi
 
v. 
Caripelli SpA
 
[1976] 1
Lloyd’s Rep 407] were distinguishable from the present case, because that which
was referred to negotiation with a view to agreement in those cases was an
existing difference between the parties. In the present case, so it was contended,
by the end of the telephone conversation on 17 March there was no existing
difference. Every point that had been raised for discussion had been agreed.
However this submission overlooked that what had been ‘agreed’ on the telephone
on 17 March was ‘subject to contract’. Therefore the parties were still in negotiation
even in relation to those matters. Further, there were many other matters which
had still to be considered and agreed.
Before your Lordships it was sought to argue that the decision in 
Courtney
’s
case [1975] 1 WLR 297 was wrong. … While accepting that an agreement to
agree is not an enforceable contract, the Court of Appeal appears to have
proceeded on the basis that an agreement to negotiate in good faith is
synonymous with an agreement to use best endeavours and as the latter is
enforceable, so is the former. This appears to me, with respect, to be an
unsustainable proposition. The reason why an agreement to negotiate, like an
agreement to agree, is unenforceable, is simply because it lacks the necessary
certainty. The same does not apply to an agreement to use best endeavours. This
uncertainty is demonstrated in the instant case by the provision which it is said has
to be implied in the agreement for the determination of the negotiations. How can a
court be expected to decide whether, subjectively, a proper reason existed for the
termination of negotiations? The answer suggested depends upon whether the
negotiations have been determined ‘in good faith’. However the concept of a duty
to carry on negotiations in good faith is inherently repugnant to the adversarial
position of the parties when involved in negotiations. Each party to the negotiations
is entitled to pursue his (or her) own interest, so long as he avoids making
misrepresentations. To advance that interest he must be entitled, if he thinks it
appropriate, to threaten to withdraw from further negotiations or to withdraw in fact,
in the hope that the opposite party may seek to reopen the negotiations by offering
him improved terms. Mr Naughton, of course, accepts that the agreement upon
which he relies does not contain a duty to complete the negotiations. But that still
leaves the vital question—how is a vendor ever to know that he is entitled to
withdraw from further negotiations? How is the court to police such an
‘agreement’? A duty to negotiate in good faith is as unworkable in practice as it is
inherently inconsistent with the position of a negotiating party. It is here that the
uncertainty lies. In my judgment, while negotiations are in existence either party is
entitled to withdraw from those negotiations, at any time and for any reason. There
can be thus no obligation to continue to negotiate until there is a ‘proper reason’ to
withdraw. Accordingly a bare agreement to negotiate has no legal content.
The validity of the agreement as originally pleaded in the
statement of claim
Paragraph 5 of the statement of claim, as unamended, followed the terms of the
oral agreement as recorded in the penultimate paragraph of the letter of 18 March
[He set out the unamended paragraph set out above and continued]
Despite the insistence by Mr Naughton upon the implied term pleaded in the
amendment involving the obligation to negotiate, Bingham LJ, in his dissenting
judgment, considered that that obligation could be severed from the agreement.
He concluded that the agreement, as originally pleaded was a valid and
enforceable agreement and entitled the Walfords to recover whatever damages
they could establish resulted in law from its repudiation.
Before considering the basis of Bingham LJ’s judgment, I believe it helpful to
make these observations about a so-called ‘lock-out’ agreement. There is clearly
no reason in the English contract law why A, for good consideration, should not
achieve an enforceable agreement whereby B agrees for a specified period of time
not to negotiate with anyone except A in relation to the sale of his property. There
are often good commercial reasons why A should desire to obtain such an
agreement from B. B’s property, which A contemplates purchasing, may be such as
to require the expenditure of not inconsiderable time and money before A is in a
position to assess what he is prepared to offer for its purchase or whether he
wishes to make any offer at all. A may well consider that he is not prepared to run
the risk of expending such time and money unless there is a worthwhile prospect,
should he desire to make an offer to purchase, of B, not only then still owning the
property, but of being prepared to consider his offer. A may wish to guard against
the risk that, while he is investigating the wisdom of offering to buy B’s property, B
may have already disposed of it or, alternatively, may be so advanced in
negotiations with a third party as to be unwilling or for all practical purposes
unable, to negotiate with A. But I stress that this is a negative agreement—B by
agreeing not to negotiate for this fixed period with a third party, locks himself out of
such negotiations. He has in 
no legal sense locked himself into negotiations with A.
What A has achieved is an exclusive opportunity, for a fixed period, to try and come
to terms with B, an opportunity for which he has, unless he makes his agreement
under seal, to give good consideration. I therefore cannot accept Mr Naughton’s
proposition, which was the essential reason for his amending paragraph 5 of the
statement of claim by the addition of the implied term, that without a positive
obligation on B to negotiate with A, the lock-out agreement would be futile.
The agreement alleged in paragraph 5 of the unamended statement of claim
contains the essential characteristics of a basic valid lock-out agreement, save
one. It does not specify for how long it is to last. Bingham LJ sought to cure this
deficiency by holding that the obligation upon Mr Miles and his wife not to deal with
other parties should continue to bind them ‘for such time as is reasonable in all the
circumstances’. He said:
‘[T]he time would end once the parties acting in good faith had found themselves unable to come to
mutually acceptable terms … the defendants could not … bring the reasonable time to an end by
procuring a bogus impasse, since that would involve a breach of the duty of reasonable good faith which
parties such as these must, I think, be taken to owe to each other.’
However, as Bingham LJ recognised, such a duty, if it existed, would indirectly
impose upon the Miles a duty to negotiate in good faith. Such a duty, for the
reasons which I have given above, cannot be imposed. That it should have been
thought necessary to assert such a duty helps to explain the reason behind the
amendment to paragraph 5 and the insistence of Mr Naughton that without the
implied term, the agreement, as originally pleaded, was unworkable—unworkable
because there was no way of determining for how long the Miles were locked out
from negotiating with any third party.
Thus even if, despite the way in which the Walfords’ case was pleaded and
argued, the severance favoured by Bingham LJ was permissible, the resultant
agreement suffered from the same defect (although for different reasons), as the
agreement contended for in the amended statement of claim, namely that it too
lacked the necessary certainty, and was thus unenforceable.
I would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.

Commentary
There were two aspects to the agreement between the parties in 
Walford
. The first was a
lock-out agreement and the second was a lock-in agreement. What is the function of
these agreements? Essentially, their function is to buy time in the context of a
transaction such as a take-over bid. Parties often incur considerable expense when
mounting a take-over bid and it may be important for them to buy a period of time in
which to attempt to reach agreement or to put the deal together (in terms of putting the
finance in place, etc.). What is the difference between a lock-out and a lock-in
agreement? The difference is that a lock-out agreement precludes a party from
negotiating with any other party but does not actually require him to negotiate with the
other party to the lock-out agreement, while a lock-in agreement does actually require
the parties to negotiate with one another with a view to reaching agreement.
On the facts of 
Walford
 
the House of Lords held that the lock-out agreement was
unenforceable because it did not have a fixed time limit. While this was fatal to the lock-
out agreement in 
Walford
 
itself, it will not be an insuperable obstacle in other cases. It
can be 
overcome by careful drafting. All that is required is the insertion into the lock-out
agreement of a fixed point in time at which the agreement comes to an end. This was
done in 
Pitt
 
v. 
PHH Asset Management Ltd
 
[1994] 1 WLR 327 where a 14-day lock-out
agreement was held to be enforceable.
The conclusion of the House of Lords in relation to lock-in agreements is, however,
more problematic because it was held that they are inherently unenforceable. Lord
Ackner gave two reasons for his refusal to recognize the validity of an obligation to
negotiate in good faith. The first was that such an agreement was, in his view, too
uncertain to be enforced (see the discussion of the ‘agreement to agree’ cases at 
4.1
). The
second was that a duty to negotiate in good faith was ‘inherently repugnant to the
adversarial position of the parties involved in negotiations’. The imposition of such a
duty was, in his opinion, ‘inconsistent with the position of a negotiating party’.
It is the reasoning of the House of Lords in relation to the lock-in aspect of the
agreement that is of primary significance for this chapter. The conclusion that English
law does not recognize the validity of a duty to carry on negotiations in good faith makes
it more difficult for a court to recognize the existence of a doctrine of good faith in
English contract law. However, Lord Ackner did not state that in no circumstances
would an English court recognize the validity of a duty of good faith and it has since
been suggested that the alleged hostility of English law to the existence of a doctrine of
good faith in the performance of a contract is ‘misplaced’ (see 
Yam Seng Pte Ltd
 
v.
International Trade Corporation Ltd
 
[2013] EWHC 111 (QB), [2013] 1 All ER (Comm)
1321, [153]). Nevertheless, the robust language which he used suggests that he did not
envisage a role for a doctrine of good faith in English law.
However, the fact that English law does not presently recognize the existence of a
doctrine
 
of good faith does not mean that good faith has no impact at all on English
contract law. It does in the sense that it has an 
influence
 
upon the formulation of the
rules of contract law. In 
First Energy (UK) Ltd
 
v. 
Hungarian International Bank Ltd
[1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 194, Steyn LJ stated (at p. 196) that:
a theme that runs through our law of contract is that the reasonable expectations of honest men must be
protected. It is not a rule or a principle of law. It is the objective which has been and still is the principal
moulding force of our law of contract. It affords no licence to a Judge to depart from binding precedent. On the
other hand, if the prima facie solution to a problem runs counter to the reasonable expectations of honest men,
this criterion sometimes requires a rigorous re-examination of the problem to ascertain whether the law does
indeed compel demonstrable unfairness.
The limits of this principle should, however, be noted. In particular, it does not entitle a
judge to ‘depart from binding precedent’. The judge can only subject an argument that
appears to run contrary to the reasonable expectations of honest men (or ‘good faith’) to
‘rigorous re-examination’. In 
Pakistan International Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times
Travel (UK) Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3 WLR 727, [27] Lord Hodge confirmed that
‘the English law of contract seeks to protect the reasonable expectations of honest
people when they enter into contracts’ and cited as support for this proposition the
analysis of Lord Steyn. Lord Hodge then proceeded to observe that the principle
identified by Lord Steyn was ‘an important principle which is applied to the
interpretation of contracts’ but he then noted that
in contrast to many civil law jurisdictions and some common law jurisdictions, English law has never
recognised a general principle of good faith in contracting. Instead, English law has relied on piecemeal
solutions in response to demonstrated problems of unfairness.’
On this view English contract law is influenced by the idea of good faith, and its
individual rules may even be said to be reflective of good faith, but there is, as yet, no
overriding ‘general principle of good faith in contracting in English law’.
Before turning to the criticism that has been levelled against 
Walford
, it is worth noting
one point which may suggest that 
Walford
 
was on its facts correctly decided. That point
relates to the measure of damages sought to be recovered by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs
brought a claim for damages of £1 million. The size of the claim might possibly have had
an impact on the outcome of the case. In some legal systems a breach of an obligation to
negotiate in good faith gives rise to a claim for damages, the aim of which is to entitle
the claimant to recover the money wasted on the negotiations. The aim is not to give the
claimant the profit which it would have made had the negotiations resulted in the
conclusion of a profitable contract. In this connection it is worth noting that the
plaintiffs in 
Walford
 
recovered damages of £700 in respect of the misrepresentations
made by the defendants. This sum may have represented the plaintiffs’ wasted
expenditure. To the extent that it did, the result of the case, albeit not the language in
which it was expressed, may be consistent with that which would be reached in many
other legal systems.
The decision in 
Walford
 
has been criticized principally on the ground that it does not
impose a sanction on a party who negotiates in bad faith but does not make any
misrepresentations. This point has been made by Lord Steyn, writing extrajudicially
(‘Contract Law: Fulfilling the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men’ (1997) 113 
LQR
433, 439), when he stated:
It is … surprising that the House of Lords in 
Walford
 
v. 
Miles
 
held that an express agreement that parties must
negotiate in good faith is unenforceable. Lord Ackner observed that the concept of a duty to carry on
negotiations in good faith is inherently repugnant to the adversarial position of the parties when involved in
negotiations. As the Unidroit principles make clear it is obvious that a party is free to negotiate and is not liable
for a failure to reach an agreement. On the other hand, where a party negotiates in bad faith not intending to
reach agreement with the other party he is liable for losses caused to the other party. That is a line of reasoning
not considered in 
Walford
 
v. 
Miles
. The result of the decision is even more curious when one takes into account
that the House of Lords regarded a best endeavours undertaking as enforceable. If the issue were to arise again,
with the benefit of fuller argument, I would hope that the concept of good faith would not be rejected out of
hand.
However, as we have noted, it is possible to confine the decision in 
Walford
 
to the
context of a duty to negotiate and to reach the conclusion that it does not preclude the
recognition of a duty of good faith in the performance of a contract. Given the degree of
uncertainty which English contract law currently exhibits towards the recognition of a
duty of good faith in a contractual context (whether that context is the negotiation of a
contract, its performance, or its termination), it is necessary to examine the arguments
for and against the recognition of a duty of good faith in English contract law.
15.3
 
Good Faith: The Negative View
What are the reasons that have led the English courts to refuse to recognize the validity
of a doctrine of good faith? The principal reasons have been summarized by Professor
Brownsword in the following terms:
R BROWNSWORD, 
CONTRACT LAW: THEMES FOR THE
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
(2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 114–120
The arguments against adopting a general principle of good faith are well-
rehearsed. At least five negative themes are recurrent.
First, it is objected that a doctrine of good faith, by requiring the parties to take
into account the legitimate interests or expectations of one another, cuts against
the essentially individualistic ethic of English contract law …
Secondly … it is said that good faith is a loose cannon in commercial contracts.
Whilst everyone agrees that a doctrine of good faith represents some set of
restrictions on the pursuit of self-interest, the objection is that it is not clear how far
these restrictions go. In other words, good faith presupposes a set of moral
standards against which contractors are to be judged, but it is not clear whose (or
which) morality this is. Without a clear moral reference point, there is endless
uncertainty about a number of critical questions—for example, about whether good
faith requires only a clear conscience (subjective good faith) or whether it imports a
standard of fair dealing independent of personal conscience (objective good faith);
whether good faith applies to all phases of contracting, including pre-contractual
conduct; whether good faith regulates only conduct (namely, how the parties
conduct themselves during the formation of the contract and, subsequently, how
they purport to rely on the contractual terms for performance, termination, and
enforcement) or also the content (substance) of contracts (in other words, whether
good faith regulates matters of procedure and process or also matters of
contractual substance); whether a requirement of good faith adds anything to the
regulation of bad faith (that is, whether good faith simply comprises so many
instances of bad faith); whether good faith imposes both negative and positive
requirements (covering, say, non-exploitation, non-opportunism, non-shirking as
well as positive co-operation, support, and assistance); and so on.
Closely related to the second concern … there is a third concern, namely that a
doctrine of good faith would call for difficult inquiries into contractors’ states of
mind. Often the literature on good faith emphasises that the question of whether a
contractor has acted in good faith hinges on the contractor’s reasons for action.
This is not to be confused with matters of subjective honesty, but it does involve
speculating about a contractor’s reasons …
Fourthly, if good faith regulates matters of substance in a broad sense
(including the remedial regime) (which it seems to do once we view it as a kind of
implied term for co-operation), then this impinges on the autonomy of the
contracting parties. Accordingly, even if the sceptics allow (if only for the sake of
argument) that good faith may legitimately regulate the process of contracting, to
ensure that agreement is genuine, they will argue that, once good faith trespasses
on substance, it restricts the autonomy of the parties and it is inconsistent with the
fundamental philosophy of freedom of contract, with the idea that contract law
should set a calculable framework for self-regulation by the parties. If we combine
the thought that good faith imports an uncertain discretion with the thought that
good faith challenges the autonomy of contracting parties, we have powerful
reasons to be sceptical about the wisdom of adopting such a doctrine …
The final thread of the sceptical negative view is that a general doctrine of good
faith goes wrong in failing to recognise that contracting contexts are not all alike. If
contract law is to be sensitive to context, it cannot be right to apply a doctrine of
good faith irrespective of context. As Michael Bridge has said:
‘It is a fair reproach to English contract law that it unthinkingly treats the rules and principles of
commodity sales, time and voyage charterparties and so on as though they could be applied without
modification in very different contractual settings. Good faith theorists should 
avoid making the same sort
of mistake. In my view, what is needed is an informed treatment of different areas of commercial contract
and market activity.’
Bridge goes on to argue that it would be wholly inappropriate to introduce a
doctrine of good faith into the commodities markets, where dealing is intrinsically
competitive and where opportunistic behaviour is to be expected. This is not to say
that, even in the commodities markets, good faith is totally rejected. However,
insofar as notions of good faith are accepted, they are taken up in the standard
terms of the trade and this, Bridge argues, is the way that the market best deals
with new questions of fair dealing.
To sum up, the case against the adoption of a general principle of good faith is
that English contract law is premised on adversarial self-interested dealing (rather
than other-regarding good faith dealing); that good faith is a vague idea,
threatening to import an uncertain discretion into English law; that the
implementation of good faith doctrine would call for difficult inquiries into
contracting parties’ reasons in particular cases; that good faith represents a
challenge to the autonomy of contracting parties; and, that a general doctrine
cannot be appropriate when contracting contexts vary so much—in particular,
harking back to the first objection, a general doctrine of good faith would make little
sense in those contracting contexts in which the participants regulate their dealings
in a way that openly tolerates opportunism.
Some of these reasons can be identified in the speech of Lord Ackner in 
Walford
,
particularly the first one. The second and third objections are related in the sense that
they are directed to the uncertainty that would be generated by the recognition of a
doctrine of good faith. This is an objection that must be taken seriously. English lawyers
tend to be hostile to broad, general principles (see 
Pakistan International Airline
Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK) Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3 WLR 727, [27]: ‘in
contrast to many civil law jurisdictions, English law has never recognised a general
principle of good faith in contracting’). They are much more comfortable when
reasoning incrementally and by analogy with the existing body of case-law (see E
McKendrick, ‘Good Faith: A Matter of Principle?’ in A Forte (ed), 
Good Faith in
Contract and Property Law
 
(Hart, 1999), p. 39). Thus the fact that there are individual
rules of English contract law that are consistent with the requirements of a doctrine of
good faith cannot necessarily be used to support the proposition that English law should
recognize a general doctrine of good faith (for support for this stance see 
Pakistan
International Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK) Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3
WLR 727, [27]). Provided that the individual rules work, why abandon them in favour of
a broad, general principle? The fifth objection noted by Professor Brownsword is an
important one, in the sense that objections to a doctrine of good faith tend to come from
particular contexts, most notably the commodity markets. It is true that these markets
are competitive and that they may, to that extent, require special treatment. But not all
contracts are concluded in such a competitive environment and, where they are not, the
law should not necessarily be so hostile to the existence of an obligation to act in good
faith.
15.4
 
Good Faith: The Neutral View
Professor Brownsword also identifies a neutral view of good faith. While ultimately the
neutrality thesis inclines towards the negative view, it is nevertheless important to
identify its existence because it is probably a view that is held by many English lawyers.
Holders of the neutral view of good faith see nothing ‘intrinsically objectionable about a
good faith 
doctrine’ (R Brownsword, 
Contract Law: Themes for the Twenty-First
Century
 
(2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 120) but point out that ‘English
law has its own doctrinal tools for achieving the results that are achieved via a good faith
doctrine in other jurisdictions’. Professor Brownsword identifies two versions of the
neutrality thesis and argues that they both incline towards scepticism for the following
reasons:
R Brownsword, 
Contract Law: Themes for the Twenty-First Century
(2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 120–121
The paradigm of neutrality holds: (i) that there is a strict equivalence between a
general doctrine of good faith and the piecemeal provisions of English law that
regulate fair dealing (we can call this ‘the equivalence thesis’) and (ii) that it makes
no difference whether English law operates with a general doctrine or with
piecemeal provisions (we can call this the ‘indifference thesis’). Once we
differentiate between the equivalence and the indifference theses, and once we
distinguish between holding these theses in the abstract as against in the context
of an ongoing legal system, it becomes apparent that the neutral view has a strong
bias towards the negative view.
One way in which this bias will reveal itself is if we imagine a neutral, who
accepts both the equivalence and the indifference theses 
in the abstract
, but who
is now asked whether it would be sensible to replace the English piecemeal
approach with a general doctrine of good faith. Clearly, since (
ex hypothesi
)
nothing is to be gained by replacing one approach with the other, the neutral must
take a negative view on this practical question (unless, for some bizarre reason,
incurring transaction costs is judged to be a good thing).
Suppose, though, the proposal is not to replace the English piecemeal
approach with a general doctrine of good faith, but to supplement the former with
the latter so that they would exist alongside one another in English law. What
would the neutral say to this? Again, the neutral would have good reason to take
the negative view. If, as the neutral believes, there is a strict equivalence between
the piecemeal approach … and a general doctrine of good faith, it seems a
needless duplication to supplement the former with the latter. Worse, the neutral
might fear that specific doctrines, with well defined functions, are liable to become
clouded once a general background standard is in play, for lawyers might be
uncertain not only about whether they should found themselves on the traditional
doctrines or the new general standard but also about where the boundaries of the
traditional doctrines now lie.
As has been pointed out, a number of rules of English contract law can be rationalized as
examples of the operation of a doctrine of good faith. Professor Clarke has pointed out
(‘The Common Law of Contract in 1993: Is There a General Doctrine of Good Faith?’
(1993) 23 
HKLJ
 
318, 319) that the ‘foundations of a general rule of good faith can be
discerned in the common law dust’. Thus far (with the notable exception of the
judgment of Leggatt J in 
Yam Seng Pte Ltd
 
v. 
International Trade Corporation Ltd
[2013] EWHC 111 (QB), [2013] 1 All ER (Comm) 1321, [120]–[154], see 
15.6
) these
individual instances have not been developed into a unified principle. The clearest
example of the express recognition of a role for good faith is in relation to insurance
contracts which at common law were known as contracts of the utmost good faith or
contracts ‘
uberrimae fidei
’ (
Carter
 
v. 
Boehm
 
(1766) 3 Burr 1905). It is here that Lord
Mansfield has had his greatest influence, albeit that that influence is now largely
confined to insurance contracts. Other examples can be found of rules which can be
rationalized in terms of good faith: the rule which prevents a party snapping up a
bargain 
which he knew was not intended by the other contracting party (
Hartog
 
v. 
Colin
and Shields
 
[1939] 3 All ER 566, 
2.3
), the limited duty of disclosure which English law
recognizes (see, for example, 
Notts Patent Brick and Tile Co
 
v. 
Butler
 
(1866) 16 QBD
778, 
17.3
), the operation of the doctrines of promissory estoppel (
Central London
Property Ltd
 
v. 
High Trees House Ltd
 
[1947] KB 130, 
5.3.2
) and estoppel by convention
(
Amalgamated Investment and Property Co
 
v. 
Texas Commerce International Bank
Ltd
 
[1982] QB 84, 
5.3.4
), and the willingness of the courts to imply terms into a contract
in particular situations (see, for example, 
Scally
 
v. 
Southern Health and Social Services
Board
 
[1992] 1 AC 294, 
10.4.2
), particularly in relation to the control of the exercise of a
contractual discretion (see, for example, 
Paragon Finance plc
 
v. 
Nash
 
[2001] EWCA Civ
1466, [2002] 1 WLR 685, 
10.4.2
). Yet the fact that individual rules can be rationalized in
terms of good faith does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that English law should
adopt a general doctrine of good faith. It can be taken as evidence of the fact that the law
can operate satisfactorily with a series of individual rules and, this being the case, why
‘cloud’ their sphere of application by the adoption of a general principle of good faith?
Professor Brownsword also notes that holders of the neutral view point out that English
law has its ‘own doctrinal tools for achieving the results that are achieved via a good
faith doctrine in other jurisdictions’. There is a considerable amount of truth in this
claim. Other legal systems do use the doctrine of good faith to deal with issues which
English law manages in other ways. One example of this is provided by the way in which
the law responds to events which occur after the formation of the contract which have
the effect of rendering performance of the contract impossible, illegal, or impracticable.
English law has developed a distinct doctrine of frustration to deal with these issues,
albeit that the doctrine operates within rather narrow limits (see further 
Chapter 21
).
German law, on the other hand, uses the doctrine of good faith to regulate these matters.
It is not clear what English law stands to gain from abandoning a more focused doctrine
such as frustration in favour of a potentially amorphous, multi-purpose doctrine of good
faith. Of course, it could be argued that a doctrine of good faith might encourage English
courts to develop a broader, more flexible doctrine of frustration but such a
development would not necessarily be desirable and, in any event, that development
could occur within the existing doctrine of frustration and does not have to wait for the
creation of a doctrine of good faith. Alternatively, it could be argued that good faith is in
fact the basis of the doctrine of frustration so that an analogy can indeed be drawn here
between English law and German law. While it is true that English lawyers have never
been able to identify the basis of the doctrine of frustration with any precision (see 
21.7
),
it would not seem to be much of an advance to conclude that the foundation of the
doctrine is good faith because such a conclusion would only serve to open up the debate
as to what we mean by good faith. Further, it is not clear what practical consequences, if
any, would follow from the conclusion that good faith was the basis of the doctrine of
frustration. The disadvantages of rationalizing the doctrine of frustration in terms of
good faith would therefore seem to outweigh its advantages.
15.5
 
Good Faith: The Positive View
Turning now to the positive side of the equation, what reasons can be advanced to
support the recognition of a general doctrine of good faith in English law? Professor
Brownsword has set out a positive case for a doctrine of good faith in the following
terms:
R BROWNSWORD, 
CONTRACT LAW: THEMES FOR THE
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
(2
 
edn, Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 123–130
First, to the extent, that English law already tries to regulate bad faith dealing, it
may be argued that it would be more rational to address the problem directly
(rather than indirectly) and openly (rather than covertly) by adopting a general
principle of good faith …
Secondly, in the absence of a doctrine of good faith, it may be argued … that
the law of contract is ill-equipped to achieve fair results, on occasion leaving
judges ‘unable to do justice at all’ …
Thirdly, turning on its head the negative arguments against a general principle
of good faith, it might be argued that, with such a principle, the courts are better
equipped to respond to the varying expectations encountered in the many different
contracting contexts—and, in particular, it might be argued that the courts are
better able to detect co-operative dealing where it is taking place. Thus, the
argument runs, if English contract law adopted a doctrine of good faith, it would
pose questions of contractual interpretation and implication in a context, not only of
background standards of fair dealing, but more immediately of the concrete
expectations of the parties. Such concrete expectations would be based as much
on the way that the parties related to one another (whether they dealt with one
another in an adversarial or non-adversarial manner) as on the express provisions
of the agreement. As a result, English law would recover the ability to give effect to
nd
the spirit of the deal in a way that prioritised the parties’ own expectations …
Finally, it is arguable that the beneficial effects of a good faith doctrine go
beyond (reactive) dispute-settlement, for a good faith contractual environment has
the potential to give contracting parties greater security and, thus, greater flexibility
about the ways in which they are prepared to do business … The more that
contract doctrine provides a security against the risks of opportunism and
exploitation to which co-operative dealing exposes a contractor, the more willing
(other things being equal) contractors will be to deal in a way that optimises their
interests (even though they are thereby exposed to risk). Thus, as good faith finds
a place in the law, and as the contractual environment becomes more congenial to
trust and risk-taking, it is possible that these reciprocal influences will work
together to promote ever more co-operative thinking in both legal doctrine and
contracting practice.
In sum … a good faith doctrine allows problems of bad faith to be addressed in
a clean and direct fashion; it enables judges at all levels to deal in a coherent and
an effective manner with cases of unfair dealing; it can bring the law much more
closely into alignment with the protection of reasonable expectations (which, it
must be recognised, vary from one contracting situation to another); and it can
contribute to a culture of trust and co-operation that enhances the autonomy of
contractors and that, on a larger scale, is an important feature of successful
economies.
An illustration of the proposition that English law should attack issues of bad faith
directly rather than indirectly can be provided by the law relating to the incorporation of
onerous terms into a contract. As we have seen (see 
9.3
), the more onerous or unusual
the contract term, the greater the steps that must be taken in order to draw the existence
of the term to the attention of the other party before it can be incorporated into the
contract. This rule is open to criticism on the ground that it fails to explain why it is that
certain terms are more difficult to incorporate into a contract than others. A doctrine of
good faith might more readily provide a foundation for the reluctance of the English
courts to conclude that onerous or unusual terms have been incorporated into a contract
(a point which was acknowledged 
by Bingham LJ in 
Interfoto Picture Library Ltd
 
v.
Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd
 
[1989] QB 433, 439, see 
9.3
). But even if it is accepted
that good faith provides a more secure conceptual foundation for the rule, this is not
necessarily an argument in favour of a change in the present substantive law. Rather, it
appears to be an argument that relates to the way in which we organize or classify the
existing rules.
This, however, leads us on to the second argument noted by Professor Brownsword
which goes beyond a reflection of the current state of the law and takes on a reforming
role. This is a familiar theme in writings on good faith. Thus Professor Friedmann has
argued (‘Good Faith and Remedies for Breach of Contract’ in J Beatson and D
Friedmann (eds), 
Good Faith and Fault in Contract Law
 
(Oxford University Press,
1995), pp. 399–400) that ‘good faith may provide a unifying concept for a number of
distinct rules dealt with under different headings, and contribute to a greater
consistency in the law by exerting pressure upon rules which are incompatible with the
idea of good faith’. The first part of this quotation makes an organizational point, but the
latter part goes beyond re-organization and assumes a reforming mission. The potential
of good faith to bring about change and reform can also be illustrated by the experience
of German law where it has been said that the ‘doctrine of good faith has been used by
the courts to create new causes of action where no cause of action existed in statutory
law’ (W Ebke and B Steinhauer, ‘The Doctrine of Good Faith in German Contract Law’ in
J Beatson and D Friedmann (eds), 
Good Faith and Fault in Contract Law
 
(Oxford
University Press, 1995), p. 171).
So what impact might the doctrine of good faith have on the present rules of English
contract law? An illustration of its potential role is provided by the decision of the Privy
Council in 
Union Eagle Ltd
 
v. 
Golden Achievement Ltd
 
[1997] AC 514. Would this case
be decided the same way if English law recognized a doctrine of good faith? The plaintiff
purchaser agreed to buy a flat in Hong Kong and paid 10 per cent of the purchase price
(HK$420,000) as a deposit. The agreement specified the date, time, and place of
completion and time was stated to be in every respect the essence of the agreement.
Completion was to take place on or before 30 September 1991 and before 5 p.m. on that
day. Clause 12 of the agreement stated that, if the purchaser failed to comply with any of
the terms and conditions of the agreement, the vendor had the right to rescind the
contract and forfeit the deposit. The plaintiff failed to complete by the stipulated time
and tendered the purchase price ten minutes after the time for completion had passed.
The vendors refused to accept late payment, rescinded the contract, and forfeited the
deposit. The plaintiff refused to accept the defendants’ decision to rescind the contract
and brought an action seeking to have the contract specifically enforced. His attempt
was unsuccessful. Lord Hoffmann stated (at p. 517) that the ‘chief question’ in the case
was ‘whether the court has, and should have exercised, an equitable power to absolve
the purchaser from the contractual consequences of having been late and to decree
specific performance’. The plaintiff argued that the court did have such an absolving
power and that equity would intervene to restrain the enforcement of legal rights when
it would be unconscionable to insist upon them. The plaintiff maintained that the
element of unconscionability was present on the facts of this case: the breach was a
slight one, but the consequences were, to say the least, drastic.
Lord Hoffmann rejected the plaintiff’s argument and answered the chief question in the
negative. He maintained that the principle invoked by the plaintiff was both contrary to
the authorities and to the needs of the business world. In his view the parties should be
able to know with certainty that the terms of the contract will be enforced. A jurisdiction
to intervene in cases of ‘unconscionability’ would not produce such certainty. Indeed,
the mere existence of a discretion to grant relief would be used as a negotiating tool by a
defaulting 
purchaser. While equity will intervene to grant relief in cases of late payment
of money due under a mortgage or rent due under a lease (see 
G and C Kreglinger
 
v.
New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co Ltd
 
[1914] AC 25, 35), this jurisdiction does
not extend to the case of a contract for the sale of land. In a volatile market a vendor will
want to know whether or not he can terminate the contract and deal with someone else.
The law should, as far as possible, enable the vendor to know whether or not he is
entitled to terminate.
The need for certainty was therefore paramount and the existence of a jurisdiction to
grant relief in cases where it would be unconscionable for the vendor to exercise his
right to rescind was rejected on the ground that it would detract from the need for a
certain rule. This is an issue on which reasonable people will disagree and, indeed,
courts in other jurisdictions take a broader view of the equitable jurisdiction to grant
relief. A case can be made out that greater emphasis should have been placed upon the
motive of the vendor in deciding to terminate and forfeit the deposit. Surely he behaved
unreasonably in refusing to accept a ten-minute delay in receiving the purchase money?
Should a vendor be entitled to act capriciously and terminate because, for example, he
does not like the purchaser or because the market has moved in his favour and it has
become economically advantageous for him to find a way out of the contract which he
has concluded? The argument that he should not be so entitled is not without its merits.
But the point of the illustration is not to debate these rival merits. It is to point out that
the law cannot accept the validity of both arguments. It has to choose and English law
has chosen to come down on the side of certainty.
Would the introduction of a doctrine of good faith alter that choice? This is one of the
real difficulties that is likely to be caused by any recognition of a doctrine of good faith in
English law, namely that it will, at least initially, enable parties to re-litigate points of
law that were previously settled. In this particular case it is suggested that a doctrine of
good faith should not have the effect of changing the result of the case. The result in
Union Eagle
 
is not as harsh as it appears at first sight. Lord Hoffmann left open the
possibility that the purchaser may be able to obtain relief in extreme cases. In so far as
the sum retained by the vendor exceeds a genuine pre-estimate of the loss or a
reasonable deposit the court has ‘a discretion to order repayment of all or part of the
retained money’. And where the vendor has been unjustly enriched by improvements
made at the purchaser’s expense, the purchaser may have a personal restitutionary
claim to recover any unjust enrichment which the vendor has obtained as a result of the
work done prior to the termination. The advantage of these remedies is that they do not
undermine the promotion of certainty. While the vendor should be able to know
whether or not he is free to terminate the contract with the purchaser and deal with the
land, it does not follow that the vendor should know with the same certainty whether or
not he is entitled to retain any pre-payment made by the purchaser. In other words,
while the vendor should have restored to him the ‘freedom to deal with his land as he
pleases’, he should not have the same freedom in relation to the financial consequences
of termination. This accommodation of the conflicting interests of the vendor and
purchaser seems to be a reasonable one and it should not be disturbed by the creation of
a doctrine of good faith.
One further argument in favour of a doctrine of good faith, which is not noted by
Professor Brownsword, is that good faith is an integral component of the law of contract
in other jurisdictions and is also a mandatory part of international restatements of
contract law. In a global economy this is an increasingly important argument. But it is
not conclusive. An examination of the role of good faith in other legal systems and in
international restatements of contract law reveals that they embrace different
conceptions of good faith. The most limited version of good faith is to be found in Article
7(1) of the Vienna Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, which
states that in the interpretation of the 
Convention regard is to be had, inter alia, to the
‘observance of good faith in international trade’. The scope of this provision is the
subject of considerable controversy. Some commentators take the view that this
provision amounts to the imposition of a duty of good faith upon the parties, but this
appears to ignore the fact that the role of good faith in Article 7(1) is confined to the
‘interpretation’ of the Convention. This being the case, it seems preferable to conclude
that the Article is directed to the courts and not to the parties. In other words, the court,
in the interpretation of the Convention, must have regard to the observance of good
faith in international trade. A broader view of good faith is to be found in the United
States where the Uniform Commercial Code states in s. 1–304 that ‘every contract or
duty within [the UCC] imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and
enforcement’ and, for this purpose, section 1–201 defines good faith as ‘honesty in fact
and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing’. This version of
good faith is more extensive than that found in the Vienna Convention in that it is
clearly directed to the parties. But it is limited in the sense that it is confined to
performance and enforcement of the contract, and does not extend to the pre-
contractual stage. Further, the recognition of a duty of good faith in the performance
and enforcement of contracts in section 205 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts
has been hailed as a reflection of ‘one of the truly major advances in American contract
law during the past fifty years’ (see R Summers, ‘The General Duty of Good Faith—Its
Recognition and Conceptualization’ (1982) 67 
Cornell Law Review
 
810). A still broader
view of good faith is to be found in a range of national and international instruments.
For example, Article 242 of the German BGB states that ‘the debtor is bound to effect
performance according to the requirements of good faith, giving consideration to
common usage’; Article 1104 of the revised French Civil Code states that contracts must
be negotiated, formed, and performed in good faith; Article 1.7 of the Unidroit Principles
of International Commercial Contracts states that ‘each party must act in accordance
with good faith and fair dealing in international trade’. The comment to Article 1.7 states
that ‘good faith and fair dealing may be considered to be one of the fundamental ideas
underlying the Principles’. The importance of ‘good faith’ to the Unidroit Principles can
be seen in the fact that parties may not exclude or limit this duty. There is something of
a paradox in the idea that one can have mandatory rules in non-binding Principles. Thus
there may be no effective sanction in the event that the parties choose to incorporate the
Principles into their contract but nevertheless decide to exclude good faith. But the fact
that the duty is declared to be mandatory demonstrates the significance of good faith to
the Principles.
15.6
 
Good Faith in the Performance of a
Contract?
It is possible that at some future point English contract law will come to accept the
existence of a doctrine of good faith. The arguments for and against the recognition of
such a duty are finely balanced. Since 
Walford
 
v. 
Miles
 
was decided there have been
some signs of a more sympathetic judicial stance towards good faith (see, for example,
Timeload Ltd
 
v. 
British Telecommunications plc
 
[1995] EMLR 459; 
Philips
Electronique Grand Publique SA
 
v. 
British Sky Broadcasting Ltd
 
[1995] EMLR 472;
Haines
 
v. 
Carter
 
[2002] UKPC 49; and 
Pratt Contractors Ltd
 
v. 
Transit New Zealand
[2003] UKPC 33). On the other hand, the Supreme Court has more recently affirmed the
traditional position that English law does not recognize a general principle of good faith
in contracting (
Pakistan International 
Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK) Ltd
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3 WLR 727, [27] and [44], although contrast the more nuanced
approach of Lord Burrows which focused at [95] on the appropriateness of the duty on
the facts of the case: ‘I do not think that this is an appropriate case in which to rely on a
general principle of good faith dealing in so far as that would require a court to try to
apply a standard of what is commercially unacceptable or unreasonable behaviour’).
The clearest sign of a possible recognition of a duty of good faith in the performance of a
contract can be seen in the judgment of Leggatt J in the following case:
YAM SENG PTE LTD V. INTERNATIONAL TRADE
CORPORATION LTD
[2013] EWHC 111 (QB), [2013] 1 All ER (Comm) 1321
The parties entered into a contract under which the defendant granted to the
claimant the exclusive rights to distribute certain fragrances bearing the name
‘Manchester United’ in specified parts of the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and
Australasia. The contract did not work out as the parties had hoped and the
claimant terminated the contract, giving as its principal reason for doing so various
breaches of contract by the defendant. The claimant alleged that the defendant
had failed to ensure that orders placed by the claimant were shipped promptly, had
failed or refused to supply to the claimant all of the specified products, and had
undercut the sale by the claimant of the products at Singapore airport by permitting
the same goods to be sold more cheaply in the Singapore domestic market. The
claimant also submitted that there was an implied term of the agreement that the
parties would deal with each other in good faith. The section of the judgment
dealing with this aspect of the claim is set out below:
Leggatt J
121. The general view among commentators appears to be that in English contract
law there is no legal principle of good faith of general application: see 
Chitty on
Contract Law
 
(31st Ed), Vol 1, para 1-039. In this regard the following observations
of Bingham LJ (as he then was) in 
Interfoto Picture Library Ltd
 
v. 
Stiletto Visual
Programmes Ltd
 
[1989] 1 QB 433 at 439 are often quoted:
‘In many civil law systems, and perhaps in most legal systems outside the common law world, the law of
obligations recognises and enforces an overriding principle that in making and carrying out contracts
parties should act in good faith. This does not simply mean that they should not deceive each other, a
principle which any legal system must recognise; its effect is perhaps most aptly conveyed by such
metaphorical colloquialisms as “playing fair”, “coming clean” or “putting one’s cards face upwards on the
table.” It is in essence a principle of fair open dealing … English law has, characteristically, committed
itself to no such overriding principle but has developed piecemeal solutions in response to demonstrated
problems of unfairness.’
122. Another case sometimes cited for the proposition that English contract law
does not recognise a duty of good faith is 
Walford
 
v. 
Miles
 
[1992] 2 AC 128, where
the House of Lords considered that a duty to negotiate in good faith is ‘inherently
repugnant to the adversarial position of the parties when involved in negotiations’
and ‘unworkable in practice’ (per Lord Ackner at p. 138). That case was concerned,
however, with the position of negotiating parties and not with the duties of parties
who have entered into a contract and thereby undertaken obligations to each
other.
123.
 
Three main reasons have been given for what Professor McKendrick has
called the ‘traditional English hostility’ towards a doctrine of good faith: see
McKendrick, 
Contract Law
 
(9th Ed) pp. 221–2. The first is the one referred to by
Bingham LJ in the passage quoted above: that the preferred method of English law
is to proceed incrementally by fashioning particular solutions in response to
particular problems rather than by enforcing broad overarching principles. A
second reason is that English law is said to embody an ethos of individualism,
whereby the parties are free to pursue their own self-interest not only in negotiating
but also in performing contracts provided they do not act in breach of a term of the
contract. The third main reason given is a fear that recognising a general
requirement of good faith in the performance of contracts would create too much
uncertainty. There is concern that the content of the obligation would be vague and
subjective and that its adoption would undermine the goal of contractual certainty
to which English law has always attached great weight.
124.
 
In refusing, however, if indeed it does refuse, to recognise any such
general obligation of good faith, this jurisdiction would appear to be swimming
against the tide. As noted by Bingham LJ in the 
Interfoto
 
case, a general principle
of good faith (derived from Roman law) is recognised by most civil law systems—
including those of Germany, France and Italy. From that source references to good
faith have already entered into English law via EU legislation. For example, the
Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, which give effect to a
European directive, contain a requirement of good faith. Several other examples of
legislation implementing EU directives which use this concept are mentioned in
Chitty on Contract Law
 
(31st Ed), Vol 1 at para 1-043. Attempts to harmonise the
contract law of EU member states, such as the Principles of European Contract
Law proposed by the Lando Commission and the European Commission’s
proposed Regulation for a Common European Sales Law on which consultation is
currently taking place, also embody a general duty to act in accordance with good
faith and fair dealing. There can be little doubt that the penetration of this principle
into English law and the pressures towards a more unified European law of
contract in which the principle plays a significant role will continue to increase.
125.
 
It would be a mistake, moreover, to suppose that willingness to recognise
a doctrine of good faith in the performance of contracts reflects a divide between
civil law and common law systems or between continental paternalism and Anglo-
Saxon individualism. Any such notion is gainsaid by the fact that such a doctrine
has long been recognised in the United States …
126.
 
In recent years the concept has been gaining ground in other common
law jurisdictions …
[He set out examples from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and continued]
131.
 
Under English law a duty of good faith is implied by law as an incident of
certain categories of contract, for example contracts of employment and contracts
between partners or others whose relationship is characterised as a fiduciary one.
I doubt that English law has reached the stage, however, where it is ready to
recognise a requirement of good faith as a duty implied by law, even as a default
rule, into all commercial contracts. Nevertheless, there seems to me to be no
difficulty, following the established methodology of English law for the implication of
terms in fact, in implying such a duty in any ordinary commercial contract based on
the presumed intention of the parties.
132.
 
Traditionally, the two principal criteria used to identify terms implied in fact
are that the term is so obvious that it goes without saying and that the term is
necessary to give business efficacy to the contract. More recently, in 
Attorney
General for Belize
 
v. 
Belize Telecom Ltd
 
[2009] 1 WLR 1988 at 1993–5, the
process of implication has been analysed as an exercise in the construction of the
contract as a whole. In giving the judgment of the Privy Council in that case, Lord
Hoffmann characterised the traditional criteria, not as a series of independent
tests, but rather as different ways of approaching what is ultimately always a
question of construction: what would the contract, read as a whole against the
relevant background, reasonably be understood to mean?
133.
 
The modern case law on the construction of contracts has emphasised
that contracts, like all human communications, are made against a background of
unstated shared understandings which inform their meaning. The breadth of the
relevant background and the fact that it has no conceptual limits have also been
stressed, particularly in the famous speech of Lord Hoffmann in 
Investors
Compensation Scheme Ltd
 
v. 
West Bromwich Building Society
 
[1998] 1 WLR 896
at pp.912–3, as further explained in 
BCCI
 
v. 
Ali
 
[2002] 1 AC 251 at p.269.
134.
 
Importantly for present purposes, the relevant background against which
contracts are made includes not only matters of fact known to the parties but also
shared values and norms of behaviour. Some of these are norms that command
general social acceptance; others may be specific to a particular trade or
commercial activity; others may be more specific still, arising from features of the
particular contractual relationship. Many such norms are naturally taken for
granted by the parties when making any contract without being spelt out in the
document recording their agreement.
135.
 
A paradigm example of a general norm which underlies almost all
contractual relationships is an expectation of honesty. That expectation is essential
to commerce, which depends critically on trust. Yet it is seldom, if ever, made the
subject of an express contractual obligation. Indeed if a party in negotiating the
terms of a contract were to seek to include a provision which expressly required
the other party to act honestly, the very fact of doing so might well damage the
parties’ relationship by the lack of trust which this would signify.
136.
 
The fact that commerce takes place against a background expectation of
honesty has been recognised by the House of Lords in 
HIH Casualty
 
v. 
Chase
Manhattan Bank
 
[2003] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 61. In that case a contract of insurance
contained a clause which stated that the insured should have ‘no liability of any
nature to the insurers for any information provided’. A question arose as to whether
these words meant that the insured had no liability even for deceit where the
insured’s agent had dishonestly provided information known to be false. The
House of Lords affirmed the decision of the courts below that, even though the
clause read literally would cover liability for deceit, it was not reasonably to be
understood as having that meaning. As Lord Bingham put it at [15]:
‘Parties entering into a commercial contract … will assume the honesty and good faith of the other;
absent such an assumption they would not deal.’
To similar effect Lord Hoffmann observed at [68] that parties ‘contract with one
another in the expectation of honest dealing’, and that:
‘ … in the absence of words which expressly refer to dishonesty, it goes without saying that underlying
the contractual arrangements of the parties there will be a common assumption that the persons
involved will behave honestly.’
137. As a matter of construction, it is hard to envisage any contract which would
not reasonably be understood as requiring honesty in its performance. The same
conclusion is reached if the traditional tests for the implication of a term are used.
In particular the requirement that parties will behave honestly is so obvious that it
goes without saying. Such a requirement is also necessary to give business
efficacy to commercial transactions.
138.
 
In addition to honesty, there are other standards of commercial dealing
which are so generally accepted that the contracting parties would reasonably be
understood to take them as read without explicitly stating them in their contractual
document. A key aspect of good faith, as I see it, is the observance of such
standards. Put the other way round, not 
all bad faith conduct would necessarily be
described as dishonest. Other epithets which might be used to describe such
conduct include ‘improper’, ‘commercially unacceptable’ or ‘unconscionable’.
139.
 
Another aspect of good faith which overlaps with the first is what may be
described as fidelity to the parties’ bargain. The central idea here is that contracts
can never be complete in the sense of expressly providing for every event that
may happen. To apply a contract to circumstances not specifically provided for, the
language must accordingly be given a reasonable construction which promotes the
values and purposes expressed or implicit in the contract. That principle is well
established in the modern English case law on the interpretation of contracts: see
e.g. 
Rainy Sky SA
 
v. 
Kookmin Bank
 
[2011] 1 WLR 2900; 
Lloyds TSB Foundation
for Scotland
 
v. 
Lloyds Banking Group plc
 
[2013] UKSC 3 at [23], [45] and [54]. It
also underlies and explains, for example, the body of cases in which terms
requiring cooperation in the performance of the contract have been implied: see
Mackay
 
v. 
Dick
 
(1881) 6 App Cas 251, 263; and the cases referred to in 
Chitty on
Contracts
 
(31st Ed), Vol 1 at paras 13-012 – 13-014 …
141.
 
What good faith requires is sensitive to context. That includes the core
value of honesty. In any situation it is dishonest to deceive another person by
making a statement of fact intending that other person to rely on it while knowing
the statement to be untrue. Frequently, however, the requirements of honesty go
further. For example, if A gives information to B knowing that B is likely to rely on
the information and A believes the information to be true at the time it is given but
afterwards discovers that the information was, or has since become, false, it may
be dishonest for A to keep silent and not to disclose the true position to B. Another
example of conduct falling short of a lie which may, depending on the context, be
dishonest is deliberately avoiding giving an answer, or giving an answer which is
evasive, in response to a request for information.
142.
 
In some contractual contexts the relevant background expectations may
extend further to an expectation that the parties will share information relevant to
the performance of the contract such that a deliberate omission to disclose such
information may amount to bad faith. English law has traditionally drawn a sharp
distinction between certain relationships—such as partnership, trusteeship and
other fiduciary relationships—on the one hand, in which the parties owe onerous
obligations of disclosure to each other, and other contractual relationships in which
no duty of disclosure is supposed to operate. Arguably at least, that dichotomy is
too simplistic. While it seems unlikely that any duty to disclose information in
performance of the contract would be implied where the contract involves a simple
exchange, many contracts do not fit this model and involve a longer term
relationship between the parties which they make a substantial commitment. Such
‘relational’ contracts, as they are sometimes called, may require a high degree of
communication, cooperation and predictable performance based on mutual trust
and confidence and involve expectations of loyalty which are not legislated for in
the express terms of the contract but are implicit in the parties’ understanding and
necessary to give business efficacy to the arrangements. Examples of such
relational contracts might include some joint venture agreements, franchise
agreements and long term distributorship agreements.
143.
 
The Agreement in this case was a distributorship agreement which
required the parties to communicate effectively and cooperate with each other in its
performance. In particular, ITC needed to plan production and take account of the
expected future demand from Yam Seng for Manchester United products. For its
part Yam Seng, which was incurring expense in marketing the products and was
trying to obtain orders, was arguably entitled to expect that it would be kept
informed of ITC’s best estimates of when products would be available to sell and
would be told of any material change in this information without having to ask. 
Yam
Seng’s case was not advanced in this way, however, and it is therefore
unnecessary for me to decide whether the requirements of good faith in this case
extended to any such positive obligations of disclosure.
144.
 
Although its requirements are sensitive to context, the test of good faith is
objective in the sense that it depends not on either party’s perception of whether
particular conduct is improper but on whether in the particular context the conduct
would be regarded as commercially unacceptable by reasonable and honest
people. The standard is thus similar to that described by Lord Nicholls in a different
context in his seminal speech in 
Royal Brunei Airlines
 
v. 
Tan
 
[1995] 2 AC 378 at
pp. 389–390. This follows from the fact that the content of the duty of good faith is
established by a process of construction which in English law is based on an
objective principle. The court is concerned not with the subjective intentions of the
parties but with their presumed intention, which is ascertained by attributing to
them the purposes and values which reasonable people in their situation would
have had.
145.
 
Understood in the way I have described, there is in my view nothing novel
or foreign to English law in recognising an implied duty of good faith in the
performance of contracts. It is consonant with the theme identified by Lord Steyn
as running through our law of contract that reasonable expectations must be
protected: see 
First Energy (UK) Ltd
 
v. 
Hungarian International Bank Ltd
 
[1993] 2
Lloyd’s Rep 194, 196; and (1997) 113 LQR 433. Moreover such a concept is, I
believe, already reflected in several lines of authority that are well established. One
example is the body of cases already mentioned in which duties of cooperation in
the performance of the contract have been implied. Another consists of the
authorities which show that a power conferred by a contract on one party to make
decisions which affect them both must be exercised honestly and in good faith for
the purpose for which it was conferred, and must not be exercised arbitrarily,
capriciously or unreasonably (in the sense of irrationally): see e.g. 
Abu Dhabi
National Tanker Co
 
v. 
Product Star Shipping Ltd (The ‘Product Star’)
 
[1993] 1
Lloyd’s Rep 397, 404; 
Socimer International Bank Ltd
 
v. 
Standard Bank London
Ltd
 
[2008] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 558, 575–7. A further example concerns the situation
where the consent of one party is needed to an action of the other and a term is
implied that such consent is not to be withheld unreasonably (in a similar sense):
see e.g. 
Gan
 
v. 
Tai Ping (Nos 2 & 3)
 
[2001] Lloyd’s Rep IR 667; 
Eastleigh BC
 
v.
Town Quay Developments Ltd
 
[2010] 2 P&CR 2. Yet another example, I would
suggest, is the line of authorities of which the 
Interfoto
 
case is one which hold that
an onerous or unusual contract term on which a party seeks to rely must be fairly
brought to the notice of the other party if it is to be enforced.
146.
 
There are some further observations that I would make about the reasons
I mentioned earlier for the reluctance of English law to recognise an implied duty
on contracting parties to deal with each other in good faith.
147.
 
First, because the content of the duty is heavily dependent on context
and is established through a process of construction of the contract, its recognition
is entirely consistent with the case by case approach favoured by the common law.
There is therefore no need for common lawyers to abandon their characteristic
methods and adopt those of civil law systems in order to accommodate the
principle.
148.
 
Second, as the basis of the duty of good faith is the presumed intention of
the parties and meaning of their contract, its recognition is not an illegitimate
restriction on the freedom of the parties to pursue their own interests. The essence
of contracting is that the parties bind themselves in order to co-operate to their
mutual benefit. The obligations which they undertake include those which are
implicit in their agreement as well as those which they have made explicit.
149.
 
Third, a further consequence of the fact that the duty is based on the
parties’ presumed intention is that it is open to the parties to modify the scope of
the duty by the express 
terms of their contract and, in principle at least, to exclude
it altogether. I say ‘in principle at least’ because in practice it is hardly conceivable
that contracting parties would attempt expressly to exclude the core requirement to
act honestly.
150.
 
Fourth, I see no objection, and some advantage, in describing the duty as
one of good faith ‘and fair dealing’. I see no objection, as the duty does not involve
the court in imposing its view of what is substantively fair on the parties. What
constitutes fair dealing is defined by the contract and by those standards of
conduct to which, objectively, the parties must reasonably have assumed
compliance without the need to state them. The advantage of including reference
to fair dealing is that it draws attention to the fact that the standard is objective and
distinguishes the relevant concept of good faith from other senses in which the
expression ‘good faith’ is used.
151.
 
Fifth, in so far as English law may be less willing than some other legal
systems to interpret the duty of good faith as requiring openness of the kind
described by Bingham LJ in the 
Interfoto
 
case as ‘playing fair’, ‘coming clean’ or
‘putting one’s cards face upwards on the table’, this should be seen as a difference
of opinion, which may reflect different cultural norms, about what constitutes good
faith and fair dealing in some contractual contexts rather than a refusal to
recognise that good faith and fair dealing are required.
152.
 
Sixth, the fear that recognising a duty of good faith would generate
excessive uncertainty is unjustified. There is nothing unduly vague or unworkable
about the concept. Its application involves no more uncertainty than is inherent in
the process of contractual interpretation.

In the light of these points, I respectfully suggest that the traditional
English hostility towards a doctrine of good faith in the performance of contracts, to
the extent that it still persists, is misplaced.
Commentary
The reasons given by Leggatt J in his carefully reasoned judgment in support of the
recognition of a duty of good faith in the performance of a contract are, essentially,
three-fold: (i) the influence of comparative law, (ii) some of the current rules of English
contract law may be explained in terms of a duty of good faith in the performance of a
contract, and (iii) the arguments against the recognition of such a duty are over-stated.
Each of these points can be contested. The fact that other legal systems recognize such a
duty does not mean that English law must do so too. The acknowledgement that some of
the rules of English contract law can be said to be consistent with the existence of such a
duty does not mean that these cases are authority for the recognition of such a duty.
Finally, the arguments which are said to over-state the case against the recognition of
such a duty appear to have the support of the House of Lords in 
Walford
, and the
suggestion that the authority of the latter case can be confined to the negotiation of
contracts is not beyond challenge. The technique used by Leggatt J to give effect to the
duty of good faith in the performance of a contract was an implied term, whether a term
implied in fact or a term implied in law (on which see 
10.4 1
 
and 
10.4.2
).
The arguments for and against the recognition of a duty of good faith in the performance
of a contract remain delicately balanced. Subsequent judicial consideration of the issue
has not resolved the matter. In 
Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust
 
v. 
Compass
Group UK and Ireland Ltd (t/a Medirest)
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 200, [2013] BLR 265, [107]
Jackson LJ, while noting that English contract law does not recognize a general doctrine
of good faith, cited 
Yam Seng
 
for the proposition that it may do so ‘as an incident of
certain categories of 
contract’. In so far as this may be thought to amount to an approval
of 
Yam Seng
, it is approval only in relation to terms implied in law and studiously
refrains from giving approval to the section of Leggatt J’s judgment where he discusses
the implication of such a term as a matter of fact. While Beatson LJ referred to 
Yam
Seng
 
(at [150]), it is not possible to discern from his brief summary of the case whether
he supported the suggestion that English law should recognize a duty of good faith in the
performance of a contract. In 
TSG Building Services plc
 
v. 
South Anglia Housing Ltd
[2013] EWHC 1151 (TCC), [2013] BLR 484, [46] Akenhead J said of 
Yam Seng
 
that he
would not ‘draw any principle from this extremely illuminating and interesting
judgment which is of general application to all commercial contracts’.
It is suggested that a distinction can be drawn between two situations. The first arises
where there is an express term of a contract which requires the parties to act in good
faith in the performance of a contract. There is no doubt that such a clause is now
enforceable (see 
Compass Group UK and Ireland Ltd
 
v. 
Mid Essex Hospital Services
NHS Trust
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 200, [2013] BLR 265), although there remain doubts
about the extent to which the same can be said about an express obligation to negotiate
in good faith. A dispute resolution clause in an existing and enforceable contract which
requires the parties to seek to resolve a dispute by friendly discussions in good faith and
within a limited period of time before the dispute may be referred to arbitration has
been held to be enforceable (
Emirates Trading Agency LLC
 
v. 
Prime Mineral Exports
Private Ltd
 
[2014] EWHC 2104 (Comm), [2014] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 457) and, building on
cases such as this, English law may yet develop in the direction of recognizing the
enforceability of an express obligation to negotiate in good faith (
Knatchbull-Hugessen
v. 
SISU Capital Ltd
 
[2014] EWHC 1194 (QB)). But 
Walford
 
v. 
Miles
 
may still stand in
the way of such a development. In relation to an express obligation to act in good faith in
the performance of the contract the remaining difficulty relates to the meaning of the
words ‘good faith’. There is probably no one answer to that question, as much will
depend upon the circumstances of the case. As Leggatt J observed, good faith has a
minimum content, namely honesty, but it may be more demanding if the relationship
between the parties is a long-term, relational one. Leggatt J subsequently returned to
this issue in 
Astor Management AG
 
v. 
Atalaya Mining plc
 
[2017] EWHC 425 (Comm),
[2017] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 476, [98] when he stated that good faith was a ‘modest’
requirement which did no more than reflect the expectation that a contracting party will
act honestly towards the other party and will not conduct itself in a way which is
calculated to frustrate the purpose of the contract or which would be regarded as
commercially unacceptable by reasonable and honest people (the case for the
recognition of a modest good faith duty is made by Chen-Wishart and Dixon ‘Good Faith
in English Contract Law: A Humble “3 by 4” Approach’ in Miller and Oberdiek (eds),
Oxford Studies in Private Law Theory, Volume One
 
(2021), p. 187).
The second situation is one in which the attempt is made to imply a good faith term into
the contract between the parties. The decision of Leggatt J in 
Yam Seng
 
stands as
authority for the proposition that the court can, in an appropriate case, imply a term
requiring good faith in the performance of the contract into the contract between the
parties. The situation in which such a term is most likely to be implied is where the
contract between the parties is a ‘relational’ one which may be defined, in broad terms,
as a long-term, collaborative, or co-operative relationship, one feature of which is that
the parties repose trust and confidence in one another (see 
Al Nehayan
 
v. 
Kent
 
[2018]
EWHC 333 (Comm), [167]–[174] and 
Bates
 
v. 
Post Office
 
[2019] EWHC 606 (QB),
[725]–[726] and [738]). A ‘relational’ contract should not, for this purpose, be equated
with a long-term contract given that a long-term contract may take the form of a
detailed contract negotiated at arm’s length into which it 
would not be appropriate to
imply a good faith term (see 
UTB LLC
 
v. 
Sheffield United Ltd
 
[2019] EWHC 2322 (Ch),
[202]–[204] and 
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd
 
v. 
Lufthansa Technik AG
 
[2020] EWHC
1789 (Ch), [185]–[221]). Rather, the hallmark of a ‘relational’ contract for this purpose
should be the lack of detailed written terms and reliance by the parties instead on
informal understandings and mutual trust and confidence. Outside this category of
‘relational’ contracts, cases subsequent to 
Yam Seng
 
have been reluctant to make that
implication. The reluctance of the courts to imply such a term can be ascribed to two
particular factors.
The first is that the implication of such a term is inconsistent with the arm’s length
nature of the relationship between the parties (see, for example, 
Myers
 
v. 
Kestrel
Acquisitions Ltd
 
[2015] EWHC 916 (Ch), [2016] 1 BCLC 719 and 
Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd
 
v. 
Lufthansa Technik AG
 
[2020] EWHC 1789 (Ch), [223]). Here the
reluctance to imply the term is linked in part to the substantive content of the term. The
more demanding it is, the less likely it is to be implied because of uncertainty over
whether or not it will give effect to the intention of the parties (
Hamsard 3147 Ltd
 
v.
Boots UK Ltd
 
[2013] EWHC 3251 (Pat)). However, it is unlikely that Leggatt J envisaged
the implication of an onerous duty on the parties. His emphasis was on the need to give
effect to the intention of the parties and, on this basis, the term may require little more
than honesty which should be readily implied (and, as he observed, may not be capable
of exclusion). But courts in some subsequent cases have read a more demanding
standard into the good faith term and this has rendered them unwilling to imply the
term into the contract before them.
The second is that the implication of a general duty of good faith would be inconsistent
with, or cut across, other terms of the contract. Thus the courts have declined to make
the implication where its effect would be to cut down the scope of an obligation which
the parties have expressed in absolute terms (
Greenclose Ltd
 
v. 
National Westminster
Bank plc
 
[2014] EWHC 1156 (Ch), [2014] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 169) or where it would duplicate
or render redundant other clauses of the contract which could be characterized in terms
of good faith (
Portsmouth City Council
 
v. 
Ensign Highways Ltd
 
[2015] EWHC 1969
(TCC), [2015] BLR 675).
On this basis the effect of the decision of Leggatt J in 
Yam Seng
 
may be limited. While in
theory courts may now be able to imply a term into a contract requiring the parties to
act in good faith in the performance of their contract, in practice the courts will be slow
to do so, with the consequence that contracting parties who wish to impose on
themselves a duty of good faith in the performance of the contract would be well advised
to do so expressly (
Chelsfield Advisers LLP
 
v. 
Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co
[2015] EWHC 1322 (Ch), [80]).
In terms of the status in English law of an obligation to act in good faith in the
performance of a contract, the emphasis placed by Leggatt J on the fact that the duty
should give effect to ‘the presumed intention of the parties’ and their desire to ‘bind
themselves in order to co-operate to their mutual benefit’ suggests that his aim was not
to use the duty of good faith in the performance of a contract as a vehicle by which to
impose significant new duties on contracting parties. Rather, his aim might have been to
promote and protect the expectation of honesty and to encourage adherence to
standards of commercial dealing which are generally accepted in the marketplace. There
is much to be said for the latter approach provided that the law is developed carefully
and incrementally, paying due attention to the legitimate interests of contracting parties
in preserving their autonomy. The question which remains to be answered is whether
the judiciary in subsequent cases will be willing to follow the suggestion which has been
made by Leggatt J and hold that, while English law does not recognize a duty of good
faith in the negotiation of a contract, it does recognize and give effect to a duty to act in
good faith in the performance of a contract.

Mistake
Central Issues
The law relating to mistake is in a state of flux. The law must strike a
balance between the need for certainty in transactions (which
demands a narrow doctrine of mistake) and the desire to protect a
party who discovers that he has entered into an agreement which is
radically different in nature from the transaction which he intended to
enter (which may demand a more liberal doctrine of mistake).
The effect of a mistake may be to prevent the formation of a contract
because, for example, the parties are at cross-purposes. But the fact
that a mistake has been made is not sufficient, of itself, to set aside
the contract. The reason for this is that the law adopts an objective
rather than a subjective approach to agreement. One issue that has
given rise to particular difficulty in the courts in this connection is the
case in which the parties meet face-to-face and one party makes a
mistake as to the identity or creditworthiness of his contracting party.
The prima facie presumption which the law applies is that a person
intends to contract with the person who is in front of him and the
presumption will only be displaced on ‘special facts’. This
presumption does not apply to written contracts. Where the contract
has been reduced to writing, the courts will not generally allow
extrinsic evidence to be led where that evidence seeks to contradict
the written terms of the contract.
Alternatively, the parties may reach agreement but that agreement is
vitiated because the parties have made the same mistake. This is an
example of ‘common mistake’. Where the mistake relates to the
existence, or possibly the identity, of the subject matter of the
contract, the mistake may suffice to set aside the contract where the
mistake is sufficiently fundamental. More difficult is the case where
4.

6.
the mistake is one that relates to the quality of the subject matter of
the contract. In the latter case the courts tend to be reluctant to allow a
party to invoke mistake because they do not wish to provide an easy
escape route for a party who has entered into a bad bargain. A mistake
as to quality will only suffice to set aside a contract in the most
extreme of cases.
The role of equity in mistake cases has proved to be extremely
controversial. Lord Denning sought to enlarge the role 
for equity and
he developed a wider, more flexible doctrine of mistake in equity than
that which existed at common law. However, this wider doctrine of
mistake in equity has been disapproved by the Court of Appeal, at
least in the context of common mistake. The latter decision is one of
the central cases in this chapter.
A mistake may be made when recording the agreement. In such a case
the court may be able to rectify the document so that it is brought into
conformity with the agreement that the parties actually made. But
rectification is only available within narrow limits.
A party may not be able to understand the document that he has
signed. In such a case he may be able to invoke the defence of 
non est
factum
. A claimant who wishes to invoke this defence must show that
he was permanently or temporarily unable, through no fault of his
own, to have without explanation any real understanding of the
document he has signed and he must show that there was a real or
substantial difference between the document which he signed and the
document which he believed that he was signing.
16.1
 
Introduction
This chapter and the subsequent chapters in this Part consider the different grounds on
which a contract may be set aside by the courts. In some of the cases a contract is
initially formed between the parties but it is then set aside by the court, whereas in other
cases the conclusion of the court is that, as a result of some defect or impediment, the
parties were never actually in a contractual relationship. The words ‘set side’ may not
naturally encompass the latter case because it can be argued that in these cases there is
no contract to ‘set aside’. Such cases are nevertheless included within this Part on the
basis that their exclusion would involve the creation of an artificial barrier between
cases that actually have significant common elements. For example, in some cases of
mistake, the effect of the mistake is to prevent a contract from coming into existence,
whereas in other cases a contract does initially come into being but it is later set aside by
the court on the ground of mistake. Rather than separate out the mistake cases into
different chapters, they have been brought together in this chapter so that we can
examine in a comprehensive manner the effect of a mistake on the validity of a contract.
The grounds on which a contract can be set aside which are considered in these chapters
are mistake (the subject of the present chapter), misrepresentation (
Chapter 17
), duress
(
Chapter 18
), undue influence (
Chapter 19
), inequality of bargaining power or
unconscionability (
Chapter 20
), incapacity (in the online resources which support this
book), illegality or public policy (in the online resources), and frustration (
Chapter 21
).
There are obvious links between some of these grounds. Mistake and misrepresentation
are closely linked in the sense that the law of misrepresentation is, in many ways, the
law of induced mistake. Common mistake and frustration are closely linked in that they
are both concerned with the situation where some common assumption shared by the
parties and which is fundamental to the contract turns out to be unfounded. The
difference between common mistake and frustration is a matter of timing. In the case of
mistake, the common assumption is unfounded at the moment of entry into the
contract, whereas in the case of 
frustration the common assumption is valid when the
contract is concluded but turns out to be unfounded in the light of events that occur
subsequent to the making of the contract. Duress, undue influence, and inequality of
bargaining power (or unconscionability) are all linked in the sense that they are all
concerned with the fairness of the bargain that has been concluded between the parties
(although it can be argued that their focus is upon different types of fairness, in that
some doctrines, such as duress, are concerned with procedural unfairness, while others,
such as unconscionability, demonstrate a concern for the substantive fairness of the
terms of the contract).
16.2
 
Mistake: The Difficulties
The law relating to the impact of a mistake on the validity of a contract is in a mess.
There are a number of reasons for this. The first is that the terminology used by the
courts and commentators is inconsistent. The principal terms employed to describe the
different types of mistake are unilateral, mutual, and common mistakes. ‘Unilateral’
mistake refers to the case in which one party only has made a mistake. ‘Common’
mistake refers to the case where the mistake is ‘common’, that is to say the parties both
made the same mistake. ‘Mutual’ mistake is more difficult. The word ‘mutual’ clearly
refers to the case where both parties are mistaken but it is not clear whether the mistake
must be the same one or not. It could apply to the case where both parties are mistaken
but they make different mistakes (so that they are at cross-purposes) or it could apply to
the case where both parties are mistaken but they make the same mistake. In the latter
case they do reach agreement but their agreement is vitiated by a mistake. Given the
difficulties that surround the word ‘mutual’ it will not be used in this chapter unless it
appears (as it does appear) in the judgments which are extracted.
The second problem relates to the jurisdictional divide between law and equity. The last
fifty years of the twentieth century saw the development of a wider doctrine of mistake
in equity (at least in cases of common mistake) under the guiding hand of Lord Denning.
This development was brought to a halt in 2002 with the decision of the Court of Appeal
in 
Great Peace Shipping Ltd
 
v. 
Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd
 
[2002] EWCA Civ
1407, [2003] QB 679, where it was held that this wider doctrine of mistake in equity was
inconsistent with the decision of the House of Lords in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Bros Ltd
 
[1932] AC
161. While the existence of a wider doctrine of mistake in equity has been denied in the
context of both common mistake and unilateral mistake (
Statoil ASA
 
v. 
Louis Dreyfus
Energy Services LP
 
[2008] EWHC 2257 (Comm), [2008] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 685), it is not
the case that the role of equity has disappeared entirely in cases of mistake. It retains a
role but it can no longer be used to undermine decisions that are binding on the courts,
such as decisions of the House of Lords.
The third problem is that mistakes can take different forms. The different types of
mistake were summarized by the Court of Appeal in 
Great Peace Shipping Ltd
 
v.
Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd
 
[2002] EWCA Civ 1407, [2003] QB 679 in the
following terms:
28. A mistake can be simply defined as an erroneous belief. Mistakes have relevance in the law of contract in a
number of different circumstances. They may prevent the mutuality of agreement that is necessary for the
formation of a contract. In order for two parties to conclude a contract binding in law each must agree with the
other the terms of the contract. 
Whether two parties have entered into a contract in this way must be judged
objectively, having regard to all the material facts. It may be that each party mistakenly believes that he has
entered into such a contract in circumstances where an objective appraisal of the facts reveals that no
agreement has been reached as to the terms of the contract. Such a case was 
Raffles
 
v. 
Wichelhaus
 
(1864) 2 H &
C 906. The parties believed that they had entered into a contract for the purchase and sale of a cargo of cotton to
arrive ‘ex Peerless from Bombay’. That term was capable of applying equally to a cargo of cotton on two
different ships, each called ‘Peerless’ and each having sailed from Bombay, one in [October] and one in
December. The court accepted that parol evidence could be adduced to prove which shipment the parties had
intended to be the subject of the contract. Had one party intended the October shipment and the other the
December shipment, the agreement necessary for a binding contract would have been absent.
29.
 
Raffles
 
v. 
Wichelhaus
 
was a case of latent ambiguity. More commonly an objective appraisal of the
negotiations between the parties may disclose that they were at cross-purposes, so that no agreement was ever
reached. In such a case there will be a mutual mistake in that each party will erroneously believe that the other
had agreed to his terms. …
30.
 
Another type of mistake is that where the parties erroneously spell out their contract in terms which do
not give effect to an antecedent agreement that they have reached. Such a mistake can result in rectification of
the contract. …
31.
 
In the present case the parties were agreed as to the express terms of the contract. The defendants
agreed that the ‘Cape Providence’ would deviate towards the ‘Great Peace’ and, on reaching her, escort her so as
to be on hand to save the lives of her crew, should she founder. The contractual services would terminate when
the salvage tug came up with the casualty. The mistake relied upon by the defendants is as to an assumption
that they claim underlay the terms expressly agreed. This was that the ‘Great Peace’ was within a few hours
sailing of the ‘Cape Providence’. They contend that this mistake was fundamental in that it would take the ‘Great
Peace’ about 39 hours to reach a position where she could render the services which were the object of the
contractual adventure.
32.
 
Thus what we are here concerned with is an allegation of a common mistaken assumption of fact which
renders the service that will be provided if the contract is performed in accordance with its terms something
different from the performance that the parties contemplated. This is the type of mistake wrhich fell to be
considered in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
. We shall describe it as ‘common mistake’, although it is often alternatively
described as ‘mutual mistake’.
Paragraphs [28] and [29] refer to mistakes which prevent the formation of a contract.
Such mistakes are discussed in Section 3. Paragraph [30] refers to mistakes made when
reducing an agreement to writing. The remedy of rectification is discussed in Section 6.
Paragraphs [31] and [32] describe the situation in which the contracting parties enter
into a contract while labouring under the same mistake. Here we can see the
terminological confusion in that these mistakes are either given the label ‘common’ or
‘mutual’ mistake. The Court of Appeal in 
Great Peace
 
preferred the label ‘common’ and
that is the label that will be used in this chapter. ‘Common’ mistakes are discussed in
16.4
 
and 
16.5
. This list of the different types of mistake is not, however, exhaustive. A
mistake may be induced by a false statement of fact made by the other party to the
contract. These mistakes are discussed in 
Chapter 17
 
under the heading
‘misrepresentation’. A mistake may also arise from the failure or inability of one party to
understand the nature of the document which he has signed. This gives rise 
to a defence
known as 
non est factum
. This defence is discussed in 
16.8
. 
Non est factum
 
cases can be
described as mistake cases, although they also have the potential to shade into
incapacity.
The fourth problem is the clash of policies that underpins this area of the law. On the
one hand, we can see in some of the judgments a desire to promote, or perhaps preserve,
certainty in commercial transactions. This policy points in favour of a narrow doctrine of
mistake so that parties cannot invoke the doctrine in order to escape from what has
turned out to be a bad bargain. Two policies point in the opposite direction, however.
The first is a concern for fairness. In some of the cases it is clear that the judges were of
the view that it was ‘unfair’ to hold the mistaken party to the terms of his bargain once
he realized the true position. The second policy is a concern to uphold the integrity of
the agreement that has been reached by the parties. Where the facts demonstrate that
the parties did not actually reach agreement as a result of a mistake made by one or both
of the parties then it can be argued that there is no agreement, or no contract, for the
courts to enforce. The latter policy is, however, tempered in its application to English
law as a result of the courts’ adoption of an objective rather than a subjective approach
to the existence of an agreement. Nevertheless, an emphasis on the need for ‘
consensus
ad idem
’ can be seen in some of the judgments.
The fifth problem relates to the range of factors to which the courts have regard. A
number of difficult issues arise here. First, how serious must a mistake be before it
suffices to set aside a contract or prevent the conclusion of a contract? Secondly, does it
matter that the defendant knew of the mistake or was responsible for inducing the
mistake in the mind of the claimant? Thirdly, what is the role of fault? Should the court
weigh the relative blameworthiness of the parties before deciding the remedial
consequences of the occurrence of a mistake? The variety of factors taken into account
by the courts makes it very difficult to stabilize this area of law.
Finally, mistake can have different remedial consequences. Some mistakes render a
contract ‘void’, while others render it ‘voidable’. A contract which is void is a nullity in
the sense that it is set aside for all purposes and so generally produces no legal effects at
all. A voidable contract, on the other hand, is valid in the sense that it is valid until the
right to set it aside has been exercised. In other cases the effect of mistake is simply to
deny the claimant a particular remedy, such as specific performance (see 
Denny
 
v.
Hancock
 
(1870) LR 6 Ch App 1, 
2.4
). As we shall see, the difference between ‘void’ and
‘voidable’ can be crucial in relation to the rights of third parties (see the concluding
paragraphs of 
16.3.3
).
16.3
 
Mistakes and Formation
The effect of a mistake may be to prevent the parties from reaching agreement. At this
point it is necessary to recall that the courts, when deciding whether or not parties have
reached agreement, adopt an objective rather than a subjective approach (see generally
Chapter 2
). Many of the cases discussed in 
Chapter 2
 
are, in fact, mistake cases. So the
mere fact that a party has made a mistake is not enough in itself to entitle a court to
conclude that the parties have not in fact entered into a contract. The effect of the
adoption of an objective approach to the existence of an agreement is to narrow the
scope of the doctrine of mistake. But it does not rule it out completely. Cases can be
found in which the courts have concluded that the effect of the mistake was to prevent
the formation of a contract between the parties.
16.3.1
 
Knowledge of a Mistake as to the Terms of
the Contract
First, a court may decide that no contract has been concluded where one party knows
that the other is labouring under a mistake in relation to the terms of the agreement and
fails to inform that other party of the mistake (see 
Smith
 
v. 
Hughes
 
(1871) LR 6 QB 597,
2.2
). The Court of Appeal in 
Smith
 
distinguished between the case where the plaintiff
believed that the defendant thought he was buying old oats and the case where the
plaintiff believed that the defendant thought he was buying oats which the plaintiff had
promised were old. In the former case the defendant is liable to take the oats and must
take the consequences of his own mistake, whereas in the latter he is not liable to take
the oats on the ground that the parties were at cross-purposes as to the terms of the
contract. Similarly, a party will not be entitled to ‘snap up’ an offer which he knew was
not intended by the party who made the offer (see 
Hartog
 
v. 
Colin & Shields
 
[1939] 3 All
ER 566, 
2.3
). There is also a wider category of case in which one party was at fault in
failing to notice that the other party’s offer contained a mistake or he was himself
responsible for inducing that mistake in the other party. In such a case the party at fault
may not be entitled to hold the other party to the terms of his offer (
Scriven Brothers &
Co
 
v. 
Hindley & Co
 
[1913] 3 KB 564, 
2.4
).
16.3.2
 
Latent Ambiguity
Secondly, a court may conclude that the terms of the offer and acceptance suffer from a
latent ambiguity such that the parties cannot be said to have reached agreement. Such
was the case in 
Raffles
 
v. 
Wichelhaus
 
(1864) 2 H & C 906, a case discussed by the Court
of Appeal in paragraph [28] of its judgment in 
Great Peace
 
(
16.2
). The Court of Appeal
in 
Great Peace
 
adopted the traditional understanding of 
Raffles
, namely that the offer
and the acceptance suffered from a ‘latent ambiguity’ in that, while both parties referred
to the vessel ‘Peerless’, the buyers apparently intended to refer to the October sailing but
the sellers intended to refer to the December sailing. 
Raffles
 
is, however, an obscure
case (see AWB Simpson, ‘The Beauty of Obscurity: 
Raffles
 
v. 
Wichelhaus and Busch
(1864)’ in 
Leading Cases in the Common Law
 
(Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 135).
The court was not asked to decide whether or not the agreement was binding on the
parties. The case came before the court on a point of pleading and the issue before the
court was whether or not the fact that there were two vessels of the same name was
capable
 
of providing the defendant buyers with a defence to the sellers’ action for the
price. The court concluded that it was so capable and accordingly entered judgment for
the defendants. No reasons were given by the judges in support of their conclusion; they
simply stated that ‘there must be judgment for the defendants’. In the absence of any
further reasoning it is difficult to know quite what to make of the case. Its role as a
leading case is obviously not due to the significance of the judgment. Rather, its fame is
attributable to the use made of it by academic writers in the late nineteenth century in
the context of debates about the basis of contract law. Writers, such as Pollock, who
maintained that there could be no contract without true consent, seized on 
Raffles
 
in
support of this theory, whereas writers who believed that the law was not concerned
with the actual state of mind of the parties were strongly critical of the decision. But the
decision of the court does not merit the significance that has subsequently been
attributed to it. Professor Simpson concludes (‘The Beauty of Obscurity: 
Raffles
 
v.
Wichelhaus and Busch
 
(1864)’ in 
Leading Cases in the Common Law
 
(Oxford
University Press, 1995), pp. 138–139):
In terms of contract law the judges seem to have thought that, once it appeared that there were two ships sailing
from Bombay which answered the contractual description, and no way of telling which of the two was intended,
the contract was latently ambiguous. Consequently, a jury should have been allowed to hear the evidence and
decide whether the parties meant the same ship, and if so which, or different ships …
What would have happened if there had been no demurrer, and the case had gone to a jury? Obviously if the
jury thought the agreement related to the October ship, the plaintiff would lose; if the December ship was
meant, then the plaintiff would win. But what if the jury thought that the parties meant different ships, or that
there was just no way of telling to which the contract related? The judge would then have the tricky task of
directing them as to what consequence followed, as a matter of law, from this. But in 
Raffles
 
v. 
Wichelhaus
there was no need for the judges to reach any conclusion on what a suitable direction would have been. It was
enough that the pleas, if true, might furnish an answer to the claim, for if so the plaintiff’s legal objection to it
failed. So, ‘There must be judgement for the defendant’.
Suppose, however, that the case had gone to a jury, and that it had emerged at a trial that one party meant
one ship, and the other the other, and there was just no way of telling which was the ship to which the contract
related—whatever that means. What then was to be done? This has all the seductive fascination of a
conundrum, and it has subsequently captured the imagination of generations of scholars and students of the
law of contract. Consequently they have tried, with some desperation, to prise an answer to the conundrum out
of the texts of the reports of the case.
Fortunately for the subsequent uses to which the case has been put, there is no clear answer to be found
there. Mellish and Cohen [counsel for the buyers] certainly argued that, if one party meant one ship and the
other party the other, there would be no contract at all; they used the expression 
consensus ad idem
, agreement
as to the same thing, and their argument was that, without such 
consensus
, there would be no contract at all.
They would know the story behind the case, and as reputable counsel would not seek to mislead the court;
common sense suggests that this was indeed the situation. For some reason, which nobody explained, there had
been a complete misunderstanding. Their argument was stopped at this point by the judges, but we cannot
conclude from this that the judges all agreed with counsel, and even if the parties did mean different ships there
might be some reason for preferring one person’s understanding to the other. For example, the
misunderstanding could have been the fault of one rather than the other. There was no need for the judges to
grapple with this conundrum. So, although they may well have agreed with counsel, there is just no way of being
sure of this. There is indeed a limit to what can be deduced from any text, or treated as consistent with it. We
can, perhaps, sensibly pore over the text of 
Macbeth
 
to determine the number of Lady Macbeth’s children, but it
is a waste of time to attempt to discover from it whether Macbeth suffered from athlete’s foot.
While 
Raffles
 
v. 
Wichelhaus
 
is always discussed in the books and is cited in the courts
by way of illustration, it has rarely been followed by the courts. The reason for this is
that it is simply too obscure. As Chitty concludes (H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on Contracts
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021), para 5–019), in a modern case of similar character
‘it is unlikely that the facts proved would be so sparse as not to give some ground for
adopting one interpretation of the contract rather than the other’.
16.3.3
 
Mistake as to Identity
The third case in which a mistake may prevent the formation of a contract is where there
has been a mistake as to the identity of the party who is said to be a party to the contract.
The standard case is one in which one party, A, enters into a contract with B in the
mistaken belief that B is in fact C. A’s mistake is typically induced by B’s fraudulent
representation that he is C. Does A’s mistake render the contract between himself and B
void or does it merely render the contract voidable on the ground that it was entered
into as a result of B’s fraudulent misrepresentation? This question does not admit of a
simple answer. In large part, the answer depends on whether the contract between A
and B has been reduced to writing. Where the contract has been reduced to writing, and
the written agreement states that the parties to it are A and C, then the authorities
suggest that the contract between A and B may indeed be void for mistake. But where
the contract between A and B has been made orally in face-to-face dealings, then A is
unlikely to succeed in his claim that the contract is void for mistake because, in such a
case, the law presumes that A intended to contract with the person who was actually in
front of him (i.e. B) and that presumption is very difficult to rebut. Not everyone is
convinced that the law should distinguish in this way between written contracts and oral
contracts but the distinction was affirmed by the House of Lords, albeit by a bare
majority, in 
Shogun Finance Ltd
 
v. 
Hudson
 
[2003] UKHL 62, [2004] 1 AC 919.
Given the controversy which surrounds 
Shogun
, it is important to set the case in its
context. There are a number of important cases which precede 
Shogun
 
and extracts
from these cases can be found in the 
online resources
 
which support this book. Most
of these cases are discussed in 
Shogun
 
itself but it may be helpful to describe five of
them in outline by way of introduction to 
Shogun
.
The first is the decision of the House of Lords in 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
 
(1878) 3 App Cas 459
(for a detailed discussion of 
Cundy
 
and other leading cases from a historical perspective,
see C Macmillan, ‘Rogues, Swindlers and Cheats: The Development of Mistake of
Identity in English Contract Law’ [2005] 
CLJ
 
711). One Alfred Blenkarn wrote to the
plaintiff linen manufacturers and ordered from them goods which included cambric
handkerchiefs. The letters were written from 37 Wood Street where Blenkarn had hired
a room (although he pretended to have a warehouse there). He signed his letters in such
a way as to make it appear as if they had come from Blenkiron & Co. The plaintiffs knew
of a respectable firm of W Blenkiron & Co which carried on business in Wood Street,
albeit they did so at number 123 and not number 37. The plaintiffs sent the goods on
credit to ‘Messrs Blenkiron & Co., 37 Wood Street, Cheapside’ where they were received
by Blenkarn. Blenkarn then sold 250 dozen cambric handkerchiefs to Messrs Cundy, the
defendants, who bought them in good faith. The House of Lords held that no contract
had been concluded between the plaintiffs and Blenkarn for the sale of the
handkerchiefs. The contract was void for mistake and, this being the case, Blenkarn had
no title to the goods which he could confer on the defendants. The defendants were
therefore liable to the plaintiffs for the value of the goods.
However, it was not the case that every mistake made by a party to a written contract
rendered the contract void. In this respect it is useful to contrast 
Cundy
 
with 
King’s
Norton Metal Co
 
v. 
Edridge Merrett & Co Ltd
 
(1897) 14 TLR 98, where a rogue assumed
the name of Hallam & Co and the plaintiffs dealt with him, through written
correspondence, on this basis. The rogue, Wallis, received goods from the plaintiffs on
credit and sold them on to the defendants who bought them in good faith. When Wallis’
fraud was discovered the plaintiffs 
brought an action in conversion
 
against the
defendants and relied upon the decision in 
Cundy
. Their claim failed. The Court of
Appeal held that the plaintiffs intended to contract with the writer of the letters. A.L.
Smith LJ stated (at p. 99) that:
if it could have been shown that there was a separate entity called Hallam & Co, and another entity called Wallis
then the case might have come within the decision in 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
.
But on the facts there was ‘only one entity, trading it might be under an alias, and there
was a contract by which the property passed to’ the person who wrote the letters. The
difference between 
Cundy
 
and 
King’s Norton
 
would appear to be that the plaintiffs in
Cundy
 
knew of the entity with which they intended to deal, Blenkiron & Co, and that
entity was different from the identity of the author of the letters, whereas the plaintiffs
in 
King’s Norton
 
intended to deal with the author of the letters but were under the
mistaken impression that the author was a company called Hallam & Co when in fact it
was Wallis.
The remaining three cases concern contracts concluded between parties who dealt with
one another face-to-face. The first of these cases is the decision of Horridge J in 
Phillips
v. 
Brooks
 
[1919] 2 KB 243. A man entered the plaintiff’s shop and asked to see some
pearls and some rings. He selected pearls priced at £2,550 and a ring priced at £450. He
then produced a cheque book and wrote out a cheque for £3,000. As he signed the
cheque he said ‘You see who I am, I am Sir George Bullough’ and he gave an address in
St James’s Square. The plaintiff knew of the existence of Sir George Bullough. Having
checked the address given in a directory he said to the man ‘Would you like to take the
1
articles with you?’ The man replied: ‘You had better have the cheque cleared first, but I
should like to take the ring as it is my wife’s birthday tomorrow.’ The plaintiff let him
have the ring. The cheque was subsequently dishonoured. The person in the shop was
not Sir George Bullough but a man called North who was later convicted of obtaining the
ring by false pretences. Prior to his arrest North pledged the ring with the defendants
who, in good faith and without notice, advanced £350 to him. The plaintiff brought an
action for the value of the ring against the defendants. The claim failed. The contract
between the plaintiff and North was not void for mistake because the plaintiff was found
to have had the intention to deal with the person in front of him. The contract being
voidable, North was able to confer on the defendants good title to the ring so that they
had a defence to the claim brought against them by the plaintiff.
Phillips
 
was distinguished by the Court of Appeal in the second case, 
Ingram
 
v. 
Little
[1961] 1 QB 31. The plaintiffs, two sisters, advertised their car for sale at £725 or nearest
offer. They were visited by a man who said that his name was Mr Hutchinson. They
agreed a price of £717 for the car. The man produced his cheque book but one of the
sisters said that they would not take a cheque. He then said that he was Mr P G M
Hutchinson, that he lived at Stanstead House, Stanstead Road, Caterham, and that he
had business interests in Guildford. On being told this, one of the sisters went to a
nearby Post Office and checked in a telephone directory that there was such a person
living at this address. The sisters then decided that they could take a cheque. The cheque
was later dishonoured but not before the rogue had sold the car to the defendant car
dealer who bought the car in all good faith. The plaintiffs brought an action in
conversion against the defendant and sought to 
recover the car or its value. The Court of
Appeal held, by a majority, that the contract between the plaintiffs and the rogue was
void for mistake, with the result that the plaintiffs remained the owners of the car and
were entitled to bring an action in conversion against the defendant.
Ingram
 
was subsequently distinguished by the Court of Appeal in the third case, 
Lewis
v. 
Averay
 
[1972] 1 QB 198. The plaintiff advertised his Austin Cooper for sale for £450
in a newspaper. He was visited by a man who claimed to be Richard Greene, a well-
known actor who played Robin Hood in a television series. The man agreed to pay £450
for the car and wrote a cheque for £450, signing it ‘R A Green’. He wanted to take the
car away immediately but the plaintiff was not willing to allow him to do so until the
cheque had cleared. The man repeated that he wanted to take the car immediately and
so the plaintiff asked him if he had anything to prove that he was Richard Greene. The
man then produced a pass from Pinewood Studios, which had an official stamp on it.
The pass bore the name ‘Richard A Green’ and included a photograph of the man. The
plaintiff was satisfied at this and gave him the car, the log book, and the MOT certificate
in return for a cheque for £450. The cheque turned out to be worthless, as it had been
stolen. When the true situation came to light, the plaintiff brought an action in
conversion against Mr Averay who had purchased the car from the rogue. The Court of
Appeal held that Mr Averay was not liable to the plaintiff. The contract between the
plaintiff and the rogue was held to be voidable with the result that Mr Averay acquired a
good title to the car because he purchased it in good faith and for value before the
plaintiff acted to set aside the contract with the rogue.
Two principal difficulties can be discerned in these cases. The first lies in the
relationship between the cases involving written contracts and those involving oral
contracts. The mistake made by the plaintiffs in 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
 
was very similar to
the mistake made by the plaintiff in 
Lewis
 
v. 
Averay
 
(in the sense that both plaintiffs
entered into the contract with one party in the belief that he was another), yet the
mistake in 
Cundy
 
rendered the contract void, whereas the mistake in 
Lewis
 
did not. The
second is that the relationship between the cases involving parties dealing with one
another face-to-face is not an easy one; in particular, it is no easy task to distinguish
between 
Ingram
 
and 
Lewis
. The first of these difficulties was confronted directly by the
House of Lords in 
Shogun
, whereas the latter was only examined incidentally. It is now
time to turn to the decision of the House of Lords in 
Shogun
.
SHOGUN FINANCE LTD V. HUDSON
[2003] UKHL 62, [2004] 1 AC 919, House of Lords
A motor dealer agreed a price to sell a car to a fraudster, R, who produced a stolen
driving licence as proof of his identity (the driving licence belonged to a Mr Durlabh
Patel). The dealer faxed a copy of this driving licence to the claimant finance
company, together with a copy of a draft hire-purchase agreement which the
fraudster had signed using the name of Mr Patel. The claimant ran a credit check
on Mr Patel and, the check being satisfactory, it approved the sale. The fraudster
paid a 10 per cent deposit in order to be able to take the car away. The next day he
sold the car to the defendant who bought it from him in all good faith. When the
true position came to light the claimant brought a claim in conversion against the
defendant. The House of Lords, by a majority, held that the claimant was entitled to
delivery up of the vehicle or damages for its conversion.
The defendant claimed that he acquired good title to the car as a result of the
operation of section 27 of the Hire Purchase Act 1964 (which is set out at [43]).
The issue to be decided in relation to this claim was whether or not the fraudster,
R, was a ‘debtor’ under a ‘hire-purchase agreement’ within the meaning of the
section. It was held that he was not. He was not named as the debtor under the
hire-purchase agreement and so was not the debtor under that agreement. Nor
was evidence admissible to contradict the express terms of the agreement and to
show that it was not a written agreement with Mr Patel but an agreement with R.
There was no meeting of minds between the claimant and R so there was no
contract between the parties, nor was there a bailment of the car by the claimant to
R.
Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead
[dissenting]
The choice
33. In my view [the decision in 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
 
(1878) 3 App Cas 459] is not
reconcilable with 
Phillips
 
v. 
Brooks Ltd
 
[1919] 2 KB 243 or with 
Lewis
 
v. 
Averay
[1972] 1 QB 198 or with the starting point ‘presumption’ formulated by Devlin LJ in
Ingram
 
v. 
Little
 
[1961] 1 QB 31. The legal principle applicable in these cases
cannot sensibly differ according to whether the transaction is negotiated face to
face, or by letter, or by fax, or by e-mail, or over the telephone or by video link or
video telephone. Typically today a purchaser pays for goods with a credit or debit
card. He produces the card in person in a shop or provides details of the card over
the telephone or by e-mail or by fax. When a credit or debit card is fraudulently
misused in this way the essence of the transaction is the same in each case. It
does not differ from one means of communication to the next. The essence of the
transaction in each case is that the owner of the goods agrees to part with his
goods on the basis of a fraudulent misrepresentation made by the other regarding
his identity. Since the essence of the transaction is the same in each case, the law
in its response should apply the same principle in each case, irrespective of the
precise mode of communication of offer and acceptance.
34.
 
Accordingly, if the law of contract is to be coherent and rescued from its
present unsatisfactory and unprincipled state, the House has to make a choice:
either to uphold the approach adopted in 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
 
and overrule the
decisions in 
Phillips
 
v. 
Brooks Ltd
 
and 
Lewis
 
v. 
Averay
, or to prefer these later
decisions to 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
.
35.
 
I consider the latter course is the right one, for a combination of reasons. It
is in line with the direction in which, under the more recent decisions, the law has
now been moving for some time. It accords better with basic principle regarding
the effect of fraud on the formation of a contract. It seems preferable as a matter of
legal policy. As between two innocent persons the loss is more appropriately borne
by the person who takes the risks inherent in parting with his goods without
receiving payment. This approach fits comfortably with the intention of Parliament
in enacting the limited statutory exceptions to the proprietary principle of 
nemo dat
quod non habet
. Thus, by section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 Parliament
protected an innocent buyer from a seller with a voidable title. The classic instance
of a person with a voidable title is a person who acquired the goods by fraud: see
Bramwell LJ in 
Babcock
 
v. 
Lawson
 
(1880) 5 QBD 284, 286. Further, this course is
supported by writers of the distinction of Sir Jack Beatson: see 
Anson’s Law of
Contract
, 28th ed (2002), p. 332. It is consistent with the approach adopted
elsewhere in the common law world, notably in the United States of America in the
Uniform Commercial Code, 14th edn (1995), section 2–403. And this course
makes practical sense. In a case such as the present the owner of goods 
has no
interest in the identity of the buyer. He is interested only in creditworthiness. It is
little short of absurd that a subsequent purchaser’s rights depend on the precise
manner in which the crook seeks to persuade the owner of his creditworthiness
and permit him to take the goods away with him. This ought not to be so. The
purchaser’s rights should not depend upon the precise form the crook’s
misrepresentation takes.
36.
 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
 
has stood for a long time. But I see no reason to fear that
adopting this conclusion will unsettle the law of contract. In practice the problems
surrounding 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
 
arise only when third parties’ rights are in issue. To
bring the law here into line with the law already existing in ‘face to face’ cases will
rid the law of an anomaly. Devlin LJ’s starting point presumption is a workable
foundation which should apply in all cases. A person is presumed to intend to
contract with the person with whom he is actually dealing, whatever be the mode
of communication.
37.
 
Although expressed by Devlin LJ as a presumption, it is not easy to think of
practical circumstances where, once in point, the presumption will be displaced.
The factual postulate necessary to bring the presumption into operation is that a
person (O) believes that the person with whom he is dealing is the person the
latter has represented himself to be. Evidence that the other’s identity was of
importance to O, and evidence of the steps taken to check the other’s identity, will
lead nowhere if the transaction proceeds on the basis of the underlying factual
postulate.
[He then applied these principles to the facts of the present case and concluded
that the finance company had made the same mistake as the jeweller in 
Phillips
 
v.
Brooks Ltd
 
but that its mistake did not negative the finance company’s intention to
let the car on hire to the person in the showroom on the terms set out in the hire-
purchase agreement. He then concluded as follows]
41.
 
One further point may be noted. Some time was taken up in this case with
arguments on whether the dealer was an agent for the finance company and for
what purposes. This was in an endeavour to bring the case within the ‘face to face’
principle. The need for such singularly sterile arguments underlines the practical
absurdity of a principle bounded in this way. The practical reality is that in the
instant case the presence or absence of a representative of the finance company
in the dealer’s showroom made no difference to the course of events. Had an
authorised representative of the finance company been present no doubt he would
have inspected the driving licence himself and himself obtained the information
needed by his company. As it was, a copy of the licence, together with the
necessary information, were faxed to the finance company. I can see no sensible
basis on which these different modes of communication should affect the outcome
of this case. I would set aside the orders of the assistant recorder and the Court of
Appeal, and dismiss this action. Mr Hudson acquired a good title to the car under
section 27 of the Hire-Purchase Act 1964.
Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough
42. The question at issue on this appeal is: Did Mr Hudson acquire a good title to
the car when he bought the car from the rogue (‘R’) who himself had no title? The
basic principle is 
nemo dat quod non habet
: see the Sale of Goods Act 1979
s.21(1) and 
Helby
 
v. 
Matthews
 
[1895] AC 471 where it was held that the same rule
applied to a sale by a hire-purchaser. The hire-purchaser has no title to the goods
and no power to convey any title to a third party. The title to the goods and the
power to transfer that title to any third party remains with the hire purchase
company and with it alone. Clause 8 of the hire-purchase ‘agreement’ and the
printed words in the form immediately below the space for the customer’s
signature also expressly say the same. There are common law and statutory
exceptions to this rule …
43. In the present case, the statutory exception relied on by Mr Hudson is that
in Part III of the Hire-Purchase Act 1964 as re-enacted in the Consumer Credit Act
1974:
‘where a motor vehicle has been 
bailed
 
… under 
a hire-purchase agreement
 
… and, before the property
in the vehicle has become vested in the 
debtor
, he disposes of the vehicle to another person … [who is]
a private purchaser [who has purchased] the motor vehicle in good faith without notice of the hire-
purchase … agreement … that disposition shall have effect as if the creditor’s title to the vehicle has
been vested in the 
debtor
 
immediately before that disposition.’ (s.27(1) and (2), (emphasis supplied))
Section 29(4) adds:
‘the “
debtor
” in relation to a motor vehicle which has been 
bailed
 
… under 
a hire-purchase agreement
 
…
means the person who at the material time (whether the agreement has before that time been
terminated or not) … is … the person to whom the vehicle is bailed … 
under that agreement
.’ (emphasis
supplied)
44. The relevant question is therefore one of the application of this statutory
provision to the facts of this case (no more, no less). Thus the question becomes:
‘Was R a debtor under the hire-purchase agreement relating to the car?’ Mr
Hudson contends that R was; the Finance Company contends that he was not.
The judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal found that he was not; Sedley LJ
would have held that he was.
45.
 
What was the ‘hire-purchase’ agreement relied on? It was a written
agreement on a standard hire-purchase printed form purporting to be signed as the
‘customer’ by one Durlabh Patel, the person who lived at 45 Mayflower Rd,
Leicester, to whom driving licence No. ‘PATEL506018DJ9FM’ had been issued and
with a date of birth 01/06/58. This was an accurate identification of the real Mr
Durlabh Patel, but in no respect of R who was not the person who lived at that
address, not the person to whom the driving licence had been issued and (one
suspects) not a twin in age of the real Mr Patel. R forged Mr Patel’s signature so as
to make the signature on the hire-purchase ‘agreement’ appear to be the same as
that on the driving licence. The parties to the written ‘agreement’ are Mr Patel (the
‘customer’), and Shogun Finance Ltd (the creditor). There is also an offer and
acceptance clause:
‘You [“the customer named overleaf”] are offering to make a legal agreement by signing this document.
We [the creditor] can reject your offer, or accept it by signing it ourselves. … If we sign this document it
will become legally binding at once (even before we send you a signed copy) … ’
46. The effect of this is that: (i) it re-emphasises that the customer/hirer is, and is
only, the person named on the front of the document; (ii) it makes it clear that the
agreement is the written agreement contained in the written document; (iii) the
offer being accepted by the creditor is the offer contained in the document and that
alone, that is to say, the offer of Mr Durlabh Patel of the address in Leicester and to
whom the driving licence was issued; (iv) for a valid offer to be made, the form
must have been signed by Mr Durlabh Patel; and, (v) most importantly of all, the
question in issue becomes a question of the construction of this written document,
not a question of factual investigation and evaluation. I will take these points in turn
but the second and fifth are fundamental to them all and to the giving of the correct
answer to this case.
47.
 
The first point is a matter of the construction of the written document. It
admits of only one conclusion. There is no mention in the document of anyone
other than Mr Durlabh Patel. The language used is clear and specific, both in the
substance of the identification—name and address and driving licence number and
age—and in the express words of the offer and acceptance clause—‘the customer
named overleaf.’ The ‘agreement’ is a consumer credit agreement. It is unlike a
mere retail sale where, although title may, indeed, will normally have already
passed to the buyer, the seller is not obliged to part with the goods until he has
been paid or is satisfied that he will be paid. Credit is only relevant to the release of
the seller’s lien and to his obligation to deliver, not to the basic transaction; the
basic transaction is unaffected and will stand. Under a contract for the sale of
goods, the contract has been made and, normally, the title to the goods has vested
in the buyer before the time for payment has arrived. (Retention of title clauses are
a modern development.) By contrast, in a consumer credit transaction, the identity
of the customer is fundamental to the whole transaction because it is essential to
the checking of the credit rating of the applicant borrower. All this precedes the
making of any contract at all. No title to the goods is obtained by the hirer at any
stage. If the finance company does not accept the proposer’s offer, the proposer
has acquired nothing. Unlike in the sale of goods, there is nothing—no status quo
— which has to be undone. The observations of Devlin LJ in 
Ingram
 
v. 
Little
 
[1961]
1 QB at p.69 are not pertinent; the approach and dicta of Denning MR in 
Lewis
 
v.
Averay
 
[1972] 1 QB 198 are misplaced and wrong.

It has been suggested that the finance company was willing to do business
with anyone, whatever their name. But this is not correct: it was only willing to do
business with a person who had identified himself in the way required by the
written document so as to enable it to check before it enters into any contractual or
other relationship that he meets its credit requirements. Mr Durlabh Patel was such
an identified person and met its credit requirements so it was willing to do business
with him. If the applicant had been, say, Mr B Patel of Ealing or Mr G Patel of
Edgbaston, it would not have been willing to deal with them if they could not be
identified or did not meet with its credit requirements. Correctly identifying the
customer making the offer is an essential precondition of the willingness of the
finance company to deal with that person. The rogue knew, or at least confidently
expected, that the finance company would be prepared to deal with Mr Durlabh
Patel but probably not with him, the rogue; and he was, in any event, not willing
himself to enter into any contract with the finance company. This is not a case such
as that categorised by Sedley LJ ([2002] QB at 846) as the use of a ‘simple alias’
to disguise the purchaser rather than to deceive the vendor—the situation which
resembles that in 
King’s Norton Metal
 
v. 
Edridge Merrett & Co
 
(14 TLR 98). But,
even then, in a credit agreement it would be useless to use a pseudonym as no
actual verifiable person against whom a credit check could be run would have
been disclosed and the offer would never be accepted. Mr Durlabh Patel is the
sole hirer under this written agreement. No one else acquires any rights under it;
no one else can become the bailee of the motor car or the ‘debtor’ ‘under the
agreement’. It is not in dispute that R was not Mr Durlabh Patel nor that R had no
authority from Mr Patel to enter into the agreement or take possession of the motor
car.
49.
 
Mr Hudson seeks to escape from this conclusion by saying: ‘but the Rogue
was the person who came into the dealer’s office and negotiated a price with the
dealer and signed the form in the presence of the dealer who then witnessed it.’
The third and fourth points address this argument. The gist of the argument is that
oral evidence may be adduced to contradict the agreement contained in a written
document which is the only contract to which the finance company was a party.
The agreement is a written agreement with Mr Durlabh Patel. The argument seeks
to contradict this and make it an agreement with the rogue. It is argued that other
evidence is always admissible to show who the parties to an 
agreement are. Thus,
if the contents of the document are, without more, insufficient unequivocally to
identify the actual individual referred to or if the identification of the party is non-
specific, evidence can be given to fill any gap. Where the person signing is also
acting as the agent of another, evidence can be adduced of that fact. None of this
involves the contradiction of the document: 
Young
 
v. 
Schuler
 
11 QBD 651, which
was a case of an equivocal agency signature and it was held that evidence was
admissible that the signature was also a personal signature—‘evidence that he
intended to sign in both capacities … does not contradict the document and is
admissible’ (per Cotton LJ at p.655). But it is different where the party is, as here,
specifically identified in the document: oral or other extrinsic evidence is not
admissible. Further, the Rogue was no one’s agent (nor did he ever purport to be).
The rule that other evidence may not be adduced to contradict the provisions of a
contract contained in a written document is fundamental to the mercantile law of
this country; the bargain is the document; the certainty of the contract depends on
it. The relevant principle is well summarised in 
Phipson on Evidence
, 15th edn
(2000) pp. 1165–1166, paras 42–11 and 42–12:
‘when the parties have deliberately put their agreement into writing, it is conclusively presumed between
themselves and their privies that they intend the writing to form a full and final statement of their
intentions, and one which should be placed beyond the reach of future controversy, bad faith or
treacherous memory.’
… This rule is one of the great strengths of English commercial law and is one of
the main reasons for the international success of English law in preference to laxer
systems which do not provide the same certainty …
50.
 
The argument also fails on another ground. There was no consensus ad
idem between the finance company and the rogue. Leaving on one side the fact
that the rogue never had any intention himself to contract with the finance
company, the hire-purchase ‘agreement’ to which Mr Hudson pins his argument
was one purportedly made by the acceptance by the finance company, by signing
the creditor’s box in the form, of a written offer by Mr Durlabh Patel to enter into the
hire-purchase agreement. This faces Mr Hudson with a dilemma: either the
contract created by that acceptance was a contract with Mr Durlabh Patel or there
was no consensus ad idem, the rogue having no honest belief or contractual intent
whatsoever and the finance company believing that it was accepting an offer by Mr
Durlabh Patel. On neither alternative was there a hire-purchase agreement with
the rogue …
54.
 
It follows that the appeal must be dismissed and the majority judgment of
the Court of Appeal affirmed.
55.
 
But, before I leave this case, I should shortly summarise why the argument
of the appellant’s counsel was so mistaken. The first reason was that they
approached the question as if it was simply a matter of sorting out the common law
authorities relating to the sale of goods. They did not treat it as a matter of applying
a statutory exception to the basic common law rule, nemo dat quod non habet.
Further, they did not analyse the structure of the overall transaction and the
consumer credit agreement within it. Accordingly, they misrepresented the role of
the dealer, wrongly treating him as the contracting agent of the finance company
which he was not. They never analysed the terms of the written document and had
no regard at all to the offer and acceptance clause it contained which, if there was
any contract between a ‘debtor’ and the finance company, governed their
relationship and which expressly set out the only way in which such a contract
could come into existence. They made submissions which contradicted the
express written contract and were therefore contrary to principle and long
established English mercantile law. They submitted that 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
 
(1878) 3
App Cas 459 was wrongly decided and should be overruled, substituting for it a
general rule which, in disregard of 
the document or documents which constitute
the agreement (if any), makes everything depend upon a factual enquiry into
extraneous facts not known to both of the parties thus depriving documentary
contracts of their certainty. They sought to convert a direct documentary contract
with the finance company into a face to face oral contract made through the dealer
as the contracting agent of the finance company, notwithstanding that the dealer
was never such an agent of the finance company. Finally they sought, having by-
passed the written contract, to rely upon authorities on oral contracts for the sale of
goods, made face to face and where the title to the goods had passed to the
‘buyer’, notwithstanding that this was a documentary consumer credit transaction
not a sale and, on any view, no title had ever passed to R. In the result they have
invited a review of those authorities by reference to the particular facts of each of
them. They have sought to draw your Lordships into a discussion of the evidential
tools, eg rebuttable presumptions of fact and the so-called face-to-face ‘principle’,
used by judges in those cases to assist them in making factual decisions. …
notwithstanding that the present case concerns the construction of a written
contract. They forget that the, presently relevant, fundamental principles of law to
be applied—consensus ad idem, the correspondence of the contractual offer and
the contractual acceptance, the legal significance of the use of a written contract—
are clear and are not in dispute. Inevitably over the course of time there have been
decisions on the facts of individual ‘mistaken identity’ cases which seem now to be
inconsistent; the further learned, but ultimately unproductive, discussion of them
will warm academic hearts. But what matters is the principles of law. They are clear
and sound and need no revision. To cast doubt upon them can only be a disservice
to English law. Similarly, to attempt to use this appeal to advocate, on the basis of
continental legal systems which are open to cogent criticism, the abandonment of
the soundly based nemo dat quod non habet rule (statutorily adopted) would be
not only improper but even more damaging.
Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers
178. The correct approach in the present case is to treat the agreement as one
concluded in writing and to approach the identification of the parties to that
agreement as turning upon its construction. The particulars given in the agreement
are only capable of applying to Mr Patel. It was the intention of the rogue that they
should identify Mr Patel as the hirer. The hirer was so identified by Shogun. Before
deciding to enter into the agreement they checked that Mr Patel existed and that
he was worthy of credit. On that basis they decided to contract with him and with
no-one else. Mr Patel was the hirer under the agreement. As the agreement was
concluded without his authority, it was a nullity. The rogue took no title under it and
was in no position to convey any title to Mr Hudson.
179.
 
For these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.

Commentary
When considering the implications of this case it is important to have regard to the
transactional structure that was adopted by the parties. Hire purchase is a technique
used to provide finance typically for purchasers who do not have immediate access to
cash in order to acquire the goods. It is important to realize that there is generally no
direct contractual relationship between the car dealer and the customer in a standard
hire-purchase transaction. 
What happens is that the car dealer generally sells the car to
the finance company and the finance company then enters into a transaction with the
customer on hire-purchase terms. Hire purchase is a contract under which the finance
company agrees to hire the goods to the hirer for a period of time and the hirer in turn
promises to pay rental to the finance company (often on a monthly basis). The rental is
calculated in such a way that it covers the cost of the acquisition of the asset and also
gives the finance company a return on the money which it has advanced to the hirer. At
the end of the period of hire the hirer will be given an option to purchase the asset,
generally for a nominal sum. The hirer will generally exercise the option so that he or
she then acquires ownership of the asset but he or she is under no legal obligation to do
so. Should the hirer decide not to exercise the option then property in the goods will
remain with the finance company. The fact that the contract is between the finance
company and the customer and not between the dealer and the customer explains why it
is that the litigation in the present case involved the finance company and not the dealer.
The real interest of the finance company in the present case therefore lay in ensuring
that it obtained an adequate return on its outlay and in ensuring that it had adequate
security against debtor default. So it was not the case that the finance company wished
to deal only with Mr Durlabh Patel; it was simply that their credit check revealed that
Mr Durlabh Patel’s credit history was satisfactory for the purpose of entering into the
transaction.
The critical issue, in terms of the difference of opinion between the majority and the
minority, is the relationship between 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
, on the one hand, and cases such
as 
Phillips
 
v. 
Brooks
 
and 
Lewis
 
v. 
Averay
 
on the other hand. The view of the minority
was that the cases were irreconcilable and that it was 
Cundy
 
which should be departed
from (see, in particular, the speech of Lord Nicholls at [33]–[36]). In concluding that the
cases could not be reconciled, the minority chose to focus upon the nature of the mistake
made and they pointed out that the mistake made in cases such as 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
 
and
Phillips
 
v. 
Brooks
 
was the same, in the sense that in both cases the seller entered into
the transaction under the misapprehension that the person with whom he was
corresponding (or, in the case of the oral contract, the person with whom he was talking)
was one person, of whose name he was aware, when in fact he was a third party.
The majority, by contrast, affirmed the correctness of 
Cundy
 
(but at the same time did
not find it necessary to resolve conclusively the status of cases such as 
Phillips
 
and
Lewis
). The decision of the majority can be explained on one of two grounds. The first
approach involves the drawing of a hard and fast distinction between written contracts
and contracts which have not been made in writing. The second approach avoids
drawing such distinctions and instead returns to the application of the general objective
test of contract formation.
The basis of the first approach lies in the traditional refusal of English law to allow
extrinsic evidence to be adduced for the purpose of contradicting a term of a written
contract. This justification emerges most clearly in the speech of Lord Hobhouse at [49],
where the rule is stated to be ‘one of the great strengths of English commercial law’.
There are, however, two difficulties with this approach. The first is that it requires that a
hard and fast distinction be drawn between contracts which are made in writing and
contracts which are not. This approach runs into the difficulties which Lord Nicholls
exposes in his speech at [33]. The second difficulty is that the significance of the parol
evidence rule has diminished greatly in recent years, and it may be doubted whether
Lord Hobhouse’s analysis reflects the drift of the modern law (see, for example, D
McLauchlan (2005) 121 
LQR
 
9).
The second approach avoids drawing such hard and fast distinctions and instead relies
upon an application of the general objective test of contract formation. If a party makes
a mistake as to the terms of the agreement, and the counterparty knows of that mistake
at the 
time of entry into the agreement, the counterparty cannot rely upon the objective
appearance of agreement in order to prove the existence of a binding contract. It is
important to note in this connection that the mistake must be one that relates to the
terms of the agreement
. It is therefore necessary for the party seeking to deny the
existence of a contract to prove that the mistake made was one that concerned the
identity of the contracting party and that the identity of that party was a term of the
contract. However, it can be difficult to prove that the identity of the contracting party
was a term of the contract and a court may be readier to reach this conclusion where the
contract between the parties has been reduced to writing. Support for the latter
approach can be found in the following extract (R Stevens, ‘Objectivity, Mistake and the
Parol Evidence Rule’ in A Burrows and E Peel (eds), 
Contract Terms
 
(Oxford University
Press, 2007), pp. 101, 112–114):
Whilst it tends to be the case that parties who deal face to face simply intend to contract with the person
physically in front of them, without making it part of the deal that one of them is any particular person, there is
no necessary reason why this should always be so. Conversely, where the parties deal at arm’s length, it will 
tend
to be the case that the identity of one or both parties is part of the contract itself, but this need not be so. It is
perfectly possible to intend to contract with a person at a particular address, careless as to whom they may
actually be.
There are cases on either side of the line, some saying that on the true construction of the negotiations the
party’s identity is part of the bargain and some saying that it is not. This is exactly what is to be expected, just as
sometimes it will be a term of a bargain for the sale of oats that they are of a certain age, and sometimes it will
not. There is no single litmus test by which a factual task of construing the negotiations can be resolved and it is
a mistake to try to look for one. …
[He then turned to consider the nature of the alleged bargain struck between the parties in 
Shogun
 
v.
Hudson
 
and observed that the documentation evidenced that the finance company was only prepared to deal
with the person whose credit rating it had checked so that it was, as Lord Hobhouse had correctly concluded, a
fundamental term of the agreement that the hirer was a particular individual and continued.]
A rule which turned upon ‘whether the transaction is negotiated face to face or by letter, or by fax, or by e-
mail, or over the telephone or by video link or video telephone’ would indeed be impossible to defend. However,
this does not represent the law. There is no bright line rule, but the fact that the parties dealt face to face is some
indication, albeit not necessarily decisive, as to what was intended. It is pointless to search for a single criterion
by which to determine whether the counterparty’s identity is part of the deal struck, just as it would be pointless
to try to come up with a simple formula as to when it is or is not part of a deal for the purchase of oats that they
are of a certain age. It is all a matter of construction of the negotiations, and the relevant factors are diverse. A
lengthy review of the authorities is unhelpful therefore, and Lord Hobhouse rightly refused to engage in this
exercise.
As Professor Stevens notes, Lord Hobhouse found it unnecessary to consider in any
detail the line of authority concerned with contracts concluded as a result of face-to-face
negotiations. However, the rest of their Lordships did do so. The general picture which
emerges from their review of the cases is that they largely depend on their own facts and
that there is a presumption, which is a strong one, that a contracting party intends to
deal with the party who is present in front of him and that it will not suffice for a party to
assert that there is no contract in existence between the parties because he believed that
the person in front of him 
was, in fact, somebody else. Thus 
Phillips
 
v. 
Brooks
 
and 
Lewis
v. 
Averay
 
were cited with approval by their Lordships. 
Ingram
 
v. 
Little
 
fared rather less
well. Lord Millett (at [87]) stated that it should be ‘overruled’ and Lord Walker (at [185])
was similarly of the view that it was ‘wrongly decided’. Lord Hobhouse expressed no
view on the case, simply observing (at [47]) that it was ‘not pertinent’ to the issue that
arose on the facts of the present case. The attitude of Lord Nicholls and Lord Phillips is
more difficult to discern. Lord Nicholls discussed the case at [20]–[22]. While he clearly
preferred the reasoning of Devlin LJ to the reasoning of the majority (see [21]–[22]) he
stopped short of saying that the case was wrongly decided. Lord Phillips discussed the
case at [142]–[147] and, while he referred to the ‘powerful dissenting judgment’ of
Devlin LJ, he too stopped short of saying that the case had been wrongly decided. The
reluctance of their Lordships to resolve the status of these cases conclusively can be
explained in large part because they were held to depend so heavily upon their own
facts. If the cases ultimately depend upon their own particular facts, what useful
purpose is served by stating that a particular case, decided sixty years ago, was wrongly
decided? What would appear to matter is the presumption that is applied by the court.
The presumption is one of fact (not law) and it is a difficult one to rebut. In particular, it
will not suffice for a party to prove that he intended to deal with an identifiable third
party and not with the party who was in fact in front of him. But it may be possible to
rebut the presumption on certain exceptional facts. An example may be where the rogue
impersonates an individual known to the claimant (as in the example of Isaac and Jacob
given by Lord Walker at [187]). All of this tends to lend support to the view of Professor
Stevens that these cases are concerned with the construction of the negotiations that
took place between the parties and that, when deciding in a particular case whether the
identity of a contracting party is a term of the contract, the court must have regard to all
the facts and circumstances of the case.
Two final points remain to be made. The first relates to the role of the 
nemo dat quod
non habet
 
maxim. The litigation in the present case was conducted between two
innocent parties who had been defrauded by a third party. The claim brought by the
finance company was, in essence, that the defendant was in possession of their car and
that he should return it to them or pay its value. In many parts of the world this would
be regarded as a property claim because the claim of the finance company is one to
recover property which they say belongs to them. The defendant, by contrast, refuses to
return the car because he says that he is the owner of the car, having bought it in good
faith from his seller. Thus we have two parties, both of whom are claiming ownership of
the car. Legal systems strike the balance between these two claims in different ways.
2
English law starts from the maxim 
nemo dat quod non habet
; that is to say you cannot
give what you do not have. Thus if the rogue did not have ownership of the car, he had
no ownership to give to the defendant. It was for this reason that the distinction between
a void and a voidable contract was so important. If the contract was void then the rogue
at no time acquired ownership of the car and so had nothing to transfer to the
defendant. On the other hand, if the contract between the finance company and the
rogue was merely voidable for fraud, the rogue would acquire title to the car until such
time as the contract between the rogue and the finance company was set aside and so he
would have something to give to the purchaser at least before the contract with the
original seller was set aside. The onus was on the defendant to prove that one of the
exceptions to the 
nemo dat
 
rule was applicable on the facts of the case and the majority
concluded that no such exception was applicable. Other legal systems take a different
perspective. They start from the assumption that the third party should be protected and
the maxim in which this 
is customarily expressed is 
possession vaut titre
. In essence the
minority in the present case preferred the interest of the third party purchaser and so
sought to carve out an additional exception to the 
nemo dat
 
rule. But their attempt to do
so failed. As Lord Hobhouse pointed out (at [42]), the 
nemo dat
 
rule has been enshrined
in what is now the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and it was not open to the judiciary to
abrogate the rule or modify it by the creation of a further exception (contrast the view of
Lord Nicholls at [35]).
This leads on to the final point, which concerns whether or not the law ought to protect a
party in the position of the claimant finance house. They can be said to have assumed
the risk that their debtor would not pay and, given that they would have had to accept
the risk if the debtor had told lies about the state of his finances, why should they be
entitled to throw the risk onto the innocent third party purchaser in the case where the
debtor tells lies, not about the state of his bank account, but his name? This observation
may lie behind the perception of Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett that the third party
purchaser is generally more deserving of protection than the seller who allows the buyer
to assume possession of the goods on credit terms. Against this, it can be argued that
any such reform should come from Parliament and should not be created by the
judiciary in response to the facts of a particular case. Resolution of the conflicting policy
issues requires careful consideration of the issues and that consideration can only be
provided by Parliament, possibly after consideration of the issues by the Law
Commission. However, the practical likelihood of Parliament finding the time to
consider this issue is low.
One difficulty with the current law is its ‘all-or-nothing’ nature; either the claimant
recovers in full or he recovers nothing. An alternative approach might be to engage in
loss-splitting so that the loss occasioned by the fraud of the rogue is shared between the
claimant and the defendant. Such a proposal was made by Devlin LJ in his dissenting
judgment in 
Ingram
 
v. 
Little
 
in the following terms:
There can be no doubt, as all this difference of opinion shows, that the dividing line between voidness and
voidability, between fundamental mistake and incidental deceit, is a very fine one. That a fine and difficult
distinction has to be drawn is not necessarily any reproach to the law. But need the rights of the parties in a case
like this depend on such a distinction? The great virtue of the common law is that it sets out to solve legal
problems by the application to them of principles which the ordinary man is expected to recognise as sensible
and just; their application in any particular case may produce what seems to him a hard result, but as principles
they should be within his understanding and merit his approval. But here, contrary to its habit, the common
law, instead of looking for a principle that is simple and just, rests on theoretical distinctions. Why should the
question whether the defendant should or should not pay the plaintiff damages for conversion depend upon
voidness or voidability, and upon inferences to be drawn from a conversation in which the defendant took no
part? The true spirit of the common law is to override theoretical distinctions when they stand in the way of
doing practical justice. For the doing of justice, the relevant question in this sort of case is not whether the
contract was void or voidable, but which of two innocent parties shall suffer for the fraud of a third. The plain
answer is that the loss should be divided between them in such proportion as is just in all the circumstances. If
it be pure misfortune, the loss should be borne equally; if the fault or imprudence of either party has caused or
contributed to the loss, it should be borne by that party in the whole or in the greater part. In saying this, I am
suggesting nothing novel, for this sort of observation has often been made. But it is only in comparatively recent
times that the idea of giving to a court power to apportion loss has found a place in our law. I have in mind
particularly the Law Reform Acts of 1935, 1943 
and 1945, that dealt respectively with joint tortfeasors,
frustrated contracts and contributory negligence. These statutes, which I believe to have worked satisfactorily,
show a modern inclination towards a decision based on a just apportionment rather than one given in black or
in white according to the logic of the law. I believe it would be useful if Parliament were now to consider
whether or not it is practicable by means of a similar act of law reform to provide for the victims of a fraud a
better way of adjusting their mutual loss than that which has grown out of the common law.
This proposal was, however, considered and rejected by the Law Reform Committee in
their Twelfth Report (
Transfer of Title to Chattels
 
(Cmnd 2958, 1966)) on the ground
that it would introduce too much uncertainty and complexity into the law (particularly
in the case where the asset is the subject of a number of sales before the fraud is
discovered).
 
Conversion was defined by Atkin J in 
Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway
 
v. 
MacNicholl
 
(1919) 88 LJKB 601 as
‘dealing with goods in a manner inconsistent with the rights of the true owner … provided … there is an intention on
the part of the defendant in so doing to deny the owner’s right or to assert a right which is inconsistent with the
owner’s right’.

Common Mistake
The law in relation to common mistake (that is to say a mistake that is shared by both
parties to the contract) is dominated by two cases. The first is the decision of the House
of Lords in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Bros Ltd
 
[1932] AC 161. The second was, until relatively
recently, the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
[1950] 1 KB 671. But
Solle
 
has been effectively overruled by the Court of Appeal in 
Great Peace Shipping Ltd
v. 
Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd
 
[2002] EWCA Civ 1407, [2003] QB 679. 
Great
Peace
 
has therefore dislodged 
Solle
 
and has now assumed the role of a leading case.
The central proposition of law can be simply stated: in order to set aside a contract on
the ground of common mistake, the mistake must be ‘fundamental’. The difficulty is the
obvious one, namely the meaning in this context of the word ‘fundamental’. It would
appear that the answer depends in part upon the nature of the mistake that has been
made. Where the mistake is one as to the existence of the subject matter of the contract
(see section 6 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and 
Couturier
 
v. 
Hastie
 
(1856) 5 HLC 673,
discussed in 
Great Peace
, later in this section, at [51]–[55]) or its identity (see 
Diamond
v. 
British Columbia Thoroughbred Breeders’ Society
 
(1966) 52 DLR (2d) 146) then the
mistake is more likely to be fundamental than in the case where the mistake is one as to
the quality of the subject matter of the contract (
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Bros Ltd
 
[1932] AC 161).
But it is not the case that a mistake as to the existence or identity of the subject matter of
the contract will always constitute a fundamental mistake, whereas a mistake as to
quality will never be fundamental. Cases can be found in which a mistake as to the
existence of the subject matter of the contract has not sufficed to set aside a contract
(see 
McRae
 
v. 
Commonwealth Disposals Commission
 
(1951) 84 CLR 377, discussed in
Great Peace
, later in this section, at [77]–[80]) and cases can also be found in which a
mistake as to quality has been held to be sufficiently fundamental to set aside a contract
(see 
Scott
 
v. 
Coulson
 
[1903] 2 Ch 349, discussed in 
Great Peace
, later in this section, at
[87]–[88]). Prior to the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Great Peace
 
it was also
necessary to distinguish between the test applicable at law and the test applicable in
equity because the test for a fundamental mistake in equity was more relaxed than that
applicable at law. 
Great Peace
 
has, however, overruled this line of authority in equity
and concluded that the answer to the question whether or not 
a mistake is fundamental
is the same, both at law and in equity. However, given the bold and controversial nature
of the step taken by the Court of Appeal, it is necessary to devote some attention to 
Solle
v. 
Butcher
 
and the line of cases which it generated. It is too soon to cast them into
oblivion. The rise and fall of common mistake in equity will be considered in 
16.4
, after
we have examined the great case of 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Bros
 
and its interpretation by the Court
of Appeal in 
Great Peace
.
BELL V. LEVER BROTHERS LTD
[1932] AC 161, House of Lords
Lever Brothers Ltd controlled the Niger Company. Lever Brothers agreed to
employ Bell to act as the chairman, and Snelling to act as the vice-chairman, of the
board of directors of Niger. Bell and Snelling secretly speculated in cocoa, a
commodity in which Niger dealt. Their conduct was in breach of their contracts of
employment and would have justified Lever Brothers terminating their services.
Later, Niger merged with the African and Eastern Trade Corporation so that the
services of Bell and Snelling were no longer required. In ignorance of their
breaches of duty, Lever Brothers agreed to pay £30,000 to Bell and £20,000 to
Snelling as compensation for terminating their contracts of employment.
The jury found that if Lever Brothers had known of the breaches it would have
terminated the contracts of Bell and Snelling without paying compensation. When
Lever Brothers discovered the breaches it brought an action claiming rescission of
the compensation agreements on the grounds of fraudulent misrepresentation and
unilateral mistake induced by fraud but not on the ground of ‘mutual’ mistake. At
trial the jury found that Bell and Snelling had not acted fraudulently. However the
trial judge held that the pleadings raised the issue of mutual mistake and that the
compensation agreements were void, having been made under a common mistake
as to the legal relations between the parties, each party believing, contrary to the
truth, that the one was entitled to claim and the other was bound to pay
compensation. The Court of Appeal held that if the issue of mutual mistake was not
raised, the pleadings should be treated as amended in order to raise it and upheld
the decision of the trial judge. On appeal the House of Lords held that the issue of
mutual mistake was not raised by the pleadings and they could not be amended to
raise it. However on the basis that the issue was raised, it was held by a majority
(Viscount Haldane and Lord Warrington of Clyffe dissenting) that the compensation
agreements were not void as the mutual mistake related not to the subject matter
but to the quality of the employment contracts.
Lord Warrington of Clyffe
[dissenting on the question whether the compensation agreements were void for
mistake]
It is in my opinion clear that each party believed that the remunerative offices,
compensation for the loss of which was the subject of the negotiations, were
offices which could not be determined except by the consent of the holder thereof,
and further believed that the other party was under the same belief and was
treating on that footing.
The real question, therefore, is whether the erroneous assumption on the part
of both parties to the agreements that the service contracts were undeterminable
except by agreement was of such a fundamental character as to constitute an
underlying assumption without 
which the parties would not have made the contract
they in fact made, or whether it was only a common error as to a material element,
but one not going to the root of the matter and not affecting the substance of the
consideration.
With the knowledge that I am differing from the majority of your Lordships, I am
unable to arrive at any conclusion except that in this case the erroneous
assumption was essential to the contract which without it would not have been
made.
It is true that the error was not one as to the terms of the service agreements,
but it was one which, having regard to the matter on which the parties were
negotiating—namely, the terms on which the service agreements were to be
prematurely determined and the compensation to be paid therefor, was in my
opinion as fundamental to the bargain as any error one can imagine.
Lord Atkin
Was the agreement of March 19, 1929, void by reason of a mutual mistake of Mr
D’Arcy Cooper and Mr Bell? …
My Lords, the rules of law dealing with the effect of mistake on contract appear
to be established with reasonable clearness. If mistake operates at all it operates
so as to negative or in some cases to nullify consent. The parties may be mistaken
in the identity of the contracting parties, or in the existence of the subject matter of
the contract at the date of the contract, or in the quality of the subject matter of the
contract. These mistakes may be by one party, or by both, and the legal effect may
depend upon the class of mistake above mentioned. Thus a mistaken belief by A
that he is contracting with B, whereas in fact he is contracting with C, will negative
consent where it is clear that the intention of A was to contract only with B. So the
agreement of A and B to purchase a specific article is void if in fact the article had
perished before the date of sale. In this case, though the parties in fact were
agreed about the subject matter, yet a consent to transfer or take delivery of
something not existent is deemed useless, the consent is nullified. As codified in
the Sale of Goods Act the contract is expressed to be void if the seller was in
ignorance of the destruction of the specific chattel. I apprehend that if the seller
with knowledge that a chattel was destroyed purported to sell it to a purchaser, the
latter might sue for damages for non-delivery though the former could not sue for
non-acceptance, but I know of no case where a seller has so committed himself.
This is a case where mutual mistake certainly and unilateral mistake by the seller
of goods will prevent a contract from arising. Corresponding to mistake as to the
existence of the subject matter is mistake as to title in cases where, unknown to
the parties, the buyer is already the owner of that which the seller purports to sell
to him. The parties intended to effectuate a transfer of ownership: such a transfer
is impossible: the stipulation is 
naturali ratione inutilis
.
 
This is the case of 
Cooper
v. 
Phibbs
 
LR 2 HL 149, where A agreed to take a lease of a fishery from B, though
contrary to the belief of both parties at the time A was tenant for life of the fishery
and B appears to have had no title at all. To such a case Lord Westbury applied
the principle that if parties contract under a mutual mistake and misapprehension
as to their relative and respective rights the result is that the agreement is liable to
be set aside as having proceeded upon a common mistake. Applied to the context
the statement is only subject to the criticism that the agreement would appear to
be void rather than voidable. Applied to mistake as to rights generally it would
appear to be too wide. Even where the vendor has no title, though both parties
think he has, the correct view would appear to be that there is a contract: but that
the vendor has either committed a breach of a stipulation as to title, or is not able
3
to perform his contract. The contract is unenforceable by him but is not void.
Mistake as to quality of the thing contracted for raises more difficult questions.
In such a case a mistake will not affect assent unless it is the mistake of both
parties, and is as to the existence of some quality which makes the thing without
the quality essentially different from the thing as it was believed to be. Of course it
may appear that the parties contracted that the article should possess the quality
which one or other or both mistakenly believed it to possess. But in such a case
there is a contract and the inquiry is a different one, being whether the contract as
to quality amounts to a condition or a warranty, a different branch of the law …
We are now in a position to apply to the facts of this case the law as to mistake
so far as it has been stated. It is essential on this part of the discussion to keep in
mind the finding of the jury acquitting the defendants of fraudulent
misrepresentation or concealment in procuring the agreements in question. Grave
injustice may be done to the defendants and confusion introduced into the legal
conclusion, unless it is quite clear that in considering mistake in this case no
suggestion of fraud is admissible and cannot strictly be regarded by the judge who
has to determine the legal issues raised … [O]n the whole, I have come to the
conclusion that it would be wrong to decide that an agreement to terminate a
definite specified contract is void if it turns out that the agreement had already
been broken and could have been terminated otherwise. The contract released is
the identical contract in both cases, and the party paying for release gets exactly
what he bargains for. It seems immaterial that he could have got the same result in
another way, or that if he had known the true facts he would not have entered into
the bargain. A buys B’s horse; he thinks the horse is sound and he pays the price
of a sound horse; he would certainly not have bought the horse if he had known as
the fact is that the horse is unsound. If B has made no representation as to
soundness and has not contracted that the horse is sound, A is bound and cannot
recover back the price. A buys a picture from B; both A and B believe it to be the
work of an old master, and a high price is paid. It turns out to be a modern copy. A
has no remedy in the absence of representation or warranty. A agrees to take on
lease or to buy from B an unfurnished dwelling-house. The house is in fact
uninhabitable. A would never have entered into the bargain if he had known the
fact. A has no remedy, and the position is the same whether B knew the facts or
not, so long as he made no representation or gave no warranty. A buys a roadside
garage business from B abutting on a public thoroughfare: unknown to A, but
known to B, it has already been decided to construct a bypass road which will
divert substantially the whole of the traffic from passing A’s garage. Again A has no
remedy. All these cases involve hardship on A and benefit B, as most people would
say, unjustly. They can be supported on the ground that it is of paramount
importance that contracts should be observed, and that if parties honestly comply
with the essentials of the formation of contracts—i.e. agree in the same terms on
the same subject matter—they are bound, and must rely on the stipulations of the
contract for protection from the effect of facts unknown to them.
This brings the discussion to the alternative mode of expressing the result of a
mutual mistake. It is said that in such a case as the present there is to be implied a
stipulation in the contract that a condition of its efficacy is that the facts should be
as understood by both parties—namely, that the contract could not be terminated
till the end of the current term. The question of the existence of conditions, express
or implied, is obviously one that affects not the formation of contract, but the
investigation of the terms of the contract when made. A condition derives its
efficacy from the consent of the parties, express or implied. They have agreed, but
on what terms? One term may be that unless 
the facts are or are not of a particular
nature, or unless an event has or has not happened, the contract is not to take
effect. With regard to future facts such a condition is obviously contractual. Till the
event occurs the parties are bound. Thus the condition (the exact terms of which
need not here be investigated) that is generally accepted as underlying the
principle of the frustration cases is contractual, an implied condition. Sir John
Simon [counsel for Lever Bros] formulated for the assistance of your Lordships a
proposition which should be recorded: ‘Whenever it is to be inferred from the terms
of a contract or its surrounding circumstances that the consensus has been
reached upon the basis of a particular contractual assumption, and that
assumption is not true, the contract is avoided: i.e. it is void ab initio if the
assumption is of present fact and it ceases to bind if the assumption is of future
fact’.
I think few would demur to this statement, but its value depends upon the
meaning of ‘a contractual assumption’, and also upon the true meaning to be
attached to ‘basis’, a metaphor which may mislead. When used expressly in
contracts, for instance, in policies of insurance, which state that the truth of the
statements in the proposal is to be the basis of the contract of insurance, the
meaning is clear. The truth of the statements is made a condition of the contract,
which failing, the contract is void unless the condition is waived. The proposition
does not amount to more than this that, if the contract expressly or impliedly
contains a term that a particular assumption is a condition of the contract, the
contract is avoided if the assumption is not true. But we have not advanced far on
the inquiry how to ascertain whether the contract does contain such a condition.
Various words are to be found to define the state of things which make a condition.
‘In the contemplation of both parties fundamental to the continued validity of the
contract’, ‘a foundation essential to its existence’, ‘a fundamental reason for
making it’, are phrases found in the important judgment of Scrutton LJ in the
present case. The first two phrases appear to me to be unexceptionable. They
cover the case of a contract to serve in a particular place, the existence of which is
fundamental to the service, or to procure the services of a professional vocalist,
whose continued health is essential to performance. But ‘a fundamental reason for
making a contract’ may, with respect, be misleading. The reason of one party only
is presumedly not intended, but in the cases I have suggested above, of the sale of
a horse or of a picture, it might be said that the fundamental reason for making the
contract was the belief of both parties that the horse was sound or the picture an
old master, yet in neither case would the condition as I think exist. Nothing is more
dangerous than to allow oneself liberty to construct for the parties contracts which
they have not in terms made by importing implications which would appear to
make the contract more businesslike or more just. The implications to be made are
to be no more than are ‘necessary’ for giving business efficacy to the transaction,
and it appears to me that, both as to existing facts and future facts, a condition
would not be implied unless the new state of facts makes the contract something
different in kind from the contract in the original state of facts … We therefore get a
common standard for mutual mistake, and implied conditions whether as to
existing or as to future facts. Does the state of the new facts destroy the identity of
the subject matter as it was in the original state of facts? To apply the principle to
the infinite combinations of facts that arise in actual experience will continue to be
difficult, but if this case results in establishing order into what has been a
somewhat confused and difficult branch of the law it will have served a useful
purpose.
I have already stated my reasons for deciding that in the present case the
identity of the subject matter was not destroyed by the mutual mistake, if any, and
need not repeat them …
Lord Thankerton
Turning … to the question of mutual error or mistake, I think that the respondents’
contention may be fairly stated as follows—namely, that in concluding the
agreements of March, 1929, all parties proceeded on the mistaken assumption
that the appellants’ service agreements were not liable to immediate termination by
Lever Brothers by reason of the appellants’ misconduct, and that such common
mistake involved the actual subject matter of the agreements, and did not merely
relate to a quality of the subject matter …
The phrase ‘underlying assumption by the parties’, as applied to the subject
matter of a contract, may be too widely interpreted so as to include something
which one of the parties had not necessarily in his mind at the time of the contract;
in my opinion it can only properly relate to something which both must necessarily
have accepted in their minds as an essential and integral element of the subject
matter. In the present case, however probable it may be, we are not necessarily
forced to that assumption. 
Cooper
 
v. 
Phibbs
 
LR 2 HL 149, 170 is a good
illustration. … There are many other cases to the same effect, but I think that it is
true to say that in all of them it either appeared on the face of the contract that the
matter as to which the mistake existed was an essential and integral element of
the subject matter of the contract, or it was an inevitable inference from the nature
of the contract that all the parties so regarded it.
In the present case the terms of the contracts throw no light on the question,
and, as already indicated, I do not find sufficient material to compel the inference
that the appellants, at the time of the contract, regarded the indefeasibility of the
service agreements as an essential and integral element in the subject matter of
the bargain.
Viscount Haldane
 
agreed with the judgment of Lord Warrington of Clyffe. 
Lord
Blanesburgh
 
stated that he was in ‘entire accord’ with the conclusions of Lord
Atkin and Lord Thankerton.
Commentary
Lord Atkin uses the language of ‘mutual’ rather than ‘common’ mistake but the type of
mistake under consideration was a common mistake in that both parties entered into
the compensation agreements in the belief that Lever Bros were bound to make the
payment and that Bell and Snelling were entitled to receive it. In the first extracted
paragraph from his judgment Lord Atkin distinguishes between three different
categories of mistake, namely (i) a mistake as to the identity of the contracting parties,
(ii) a mistake as the existence of the subject matter of the contract, and (iii) a mistake as
to the quality of the subject matter of the contract. While he acknowledges that mistakes
in the first two categories can suffice to set aside a contract, he recognizes that mistakes
in the third category raise ‘more difficult questions’. It is important to note the examples
given by Lord Atkin, earlier in this section, of mistakes as to the quality of the subject
matter of the contract which would not suffice, in his opinion, to entitle a party to set
aside the contract. Particularly striking in this respect is his example of the case of the
sale of a picture which both parties mistakenly believe to be ‘the work of an old master’.
In his view the buyer in such a case has no remedy in the absence of a misrepresentation
or a contractual warranty as to the provenance of the picture (see 
Leaf
 
v. 
International
Galleries Ltd
 
[1950] 2 KB 86).
Given the size of the mistake made by Lever Bros, why did the House of Lords conclude
that the mistake was not a ‘fundamental’ mistake? The most convincing answer to this
question has been provided by Catharine MacMillan in her detailed historical review of
the case (see C MacMillan, ‘How Temptation Led to Mistake: An Explanation of 
Bell
 
v.
Lever Bros Ltd
’ (2003) 119 
LQR
 
625). Professor MacMillan points out that Lever
Brothers’ primary claim against Bell and Snelling was based on fraud. However, Lever
Brothers failed to persuade the jury that Bell and Snelling had induced them to enter
into the termination agreements by fraudulent misrepresentation or by fraudulent
concealment of their misconduct in trading in cocoa on their own account while
employed by the Niger Company. Thus she concludes (at p. 658) that the case was a
‘failed case of fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment’ and that ‘mistake was
pleaded in the alternative and left largely unaddressed during the conduct of the trial’.
One consequence of the subsidiary nature of the mistake claim was that ‘the evidence’ in
relation to mistake ‘was not what it could have been’.
Professor MacMillan further points out that the facts of the case do not support many of
the explanations that have been offered in defence of the conclusion that the mistake
made by Lever Brothers was not ‘fundamental’. One justification that has been offered is
that the mistake was not sufficiently fundamental because it was a mistake that related
‘primarily to cost’, in the sense that Lever Brothers wished to terminate the agreements
with Bell and Snelling without paying them any compensation. But she points out (at p.
657) that this explanation does not work because ‘money … was not the object of this law
suit’. The law suit was brought ‘upon principle and not for profit’. The principle was the
maintenance of standards of honesty and integrity in the running of the company. The
case was decided at a time when the ownership of a company was beginning to be
separated from the control of the company. Bell and Snelling were part of a ‘new class of
professional managers’ and Lever Brothers wished to ensure that they adhered to
appropriate standards of conduct in the running of the business. Thus the litigation was
not about money and any attempt to capture the essence of the case in monetary terms
is doomed to failure. Secondly, it has been suggested that Lever Brothers obtained their
object in that they secured the co-operation of Bell and Snelling in the corporate
restructure upon which Lever Brothers were then engaged. But, as Professor MacMillan
points out (at p. 657), this is not consistent with the facts of the case in that Bell and
Snelling were not active in the negotiations that led to the amalgamation. So they did
not require any inducement to agree to participate in the restructure.
This leaves us with two principal potential explanations of the case. The first is that
Lever Brothers ‘got exactly what they bargained for’, namely ‘the termination of the
agreements’. Professor MacMillan rejects this explanation (at p. 658) on the ground that
the mistake made by Lever Brothers did not merely make the bargain less desirable to
Lever Brothers: the bargain would not have been made had Lever Brothers known the
true situation. Here it must be remembered that Lever Brothers brought the claim on a
point of principle and so it could not be said in any realistic sense that they had obtained
what they bargained for. The final explanation for the case is ‘that the principle was
applied as it was because the case marks something of a high water mark for sanctity of
contract’. Thus Professor MacMillan points out (at p. 658) that the case was decided at
the beginning of the Great Depression and that depression would last until the outbreak
of the Second World War. At this point in history the courts did place considerable
emphasis on the importance of sanctity of contract. But, as she points out, sanctity of
contract ‘is more of an explanation for the decision’ than ‘a justification for its result’.
Professor MacMillan concludes (at p. 658) that ‘an examination of the historical
surrounding to the facts behind the case of 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Bros
 
reveals that the case is not
the stable bedrock necessary to support a functioning doctrine of mistake’. By this it
would appear that she means that regard must be had to the particular facts and
circumstances of the case. These facts and 
circumstances include the following: (i) Lever
Brothers’ principal claim was based on fraud, misrepresentation, and concealment and
that claim failed; (ii) mistake was pleaded as an afterthought and had not been properly
thought through by counsel who ‘found the mistake cases difficult to reconcile and
apply’; (iii) over the years Bell and Snelling had rendered ‘magnificent services’ to the
company and had done an ‘outstanding job’; (iv) the profit which Bell and Snelling had
made when trading on their own account was ‘comparatively small’, especially when
seen against the severance payments which they stood to lose; and (v) Lever Brothers
had benefited considerably from their endeavours on behalf of the company. These
circumstances combined to paint for their Lordships the following picture of Bell and
Snelling (at pp. 651–652):
They were presented with two gentlemen who had been absolutely exonerated of fraud. These men had
rendered exceptional service to the Niger; they were primarily responsible for its transformation from a failing
concern to financial success. Their only error was to succumb, briefly, to temptation. They did not deny that this
was a mistake. Their profits were modest, their conduct did not harm their company in any way, and when they
realised their error, they made a clean breast of it to Lever Brothers. The conduct of Bell and Snelling was not
exemplary, but it was not so egregiously awful as to strip them of all compensation. Bell, in failing health, would
never work again. It appears that in the view of the majority, at the end of the day, the breach committed by Bell
and Snelling did not justify the termination of their employment agreements. When one reads the judgments
with this approach in mind, the opinions with regard to contractual mistake are understood. The majority found
that the mistake was not sufficiently fundamental to vitiate the termination agreements. The problem is that
while this may be the correct result in the case, it produces unfortunate law with regard to contractual mistake
and also as to the standards of business conduct.
Perhaps the most appropriate conclusion to be drawn from 
Bell
 
was summed up by
Professor MacMillan in the following passage:
[T]he reason that the mistake was not considered sufficiently fundamental in this case was because of the
peculiar and exceptional circumstances that gave rise to the termination agreements. Hard cases really do make
bad law.
The circumstances in which a mistake may be held to be ‘fundamental’ were considered
further by the Court of Appeal in:
GREAT PEACE SHIPPING LTD V. TSAVLIRIS SALVAGE
(INTERNATIONAL) LTD
[2002] EWCA Civ 1407, [2003] QB 679, Court of Appeal
The defendant salvors (‘the appellants’) agreed to provide salvage services for a
vessel, the 
Cape Providence
, which was in serious difficulty in the South Indian
Ocean. The defendants contacted Ocean Routes in order to discover the identity of
vessels in the vicinity of the stricken vessel. They were told that the 
Great Peace
was proximate to the vessel. The defendants contacted the owners of the 
Great
Peace
, the claimants, by telephone and an oral agreement was made under which
the defendants agreed to hire the 
Great Peace
 
for 
a minimum of five days. During
that conversation no mention was made of the position of the 
Great Peace
. The
defendants believed that the vessels were 35 miles apart when in fact they were
410 miles apart. The defendants did not attempt immediately to set aside the
agreement when they discovered the true state of affairs. They did so only when
they found that another vessel was available to provide the necessary services.
The claimants, the owners of the 
Great Peace
, sued for the five-day hire but the
defendants refused to pay on two grounds: (i) that the agreement was void at
common law for fundamental mistake; and (ii) that the agreement was voidable in
equity. Both defences were rejected by Toulson J and by the Court of Appeal.
Judgment was entered for the claimants.
Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers
[giving the judgment of the court]
50. It is generally accepted that the principles of the law of common mistake
expounded by Lord Atkin in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
 
were based on the common law.
… The first step is to identify the nature of the common law doctrine of mistake that
was identified, or established, by 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
.
51.
 
Lord Atkin and Lord Thankerton were breaking no new ground in holding
void a contract where, unknown to the parties, the subject matter of the contract no
longer existed at the time that the contract was concluded. The Sale of Goods Act
1893 was a statute which set out to codify the common law. Section 6, to which
Lord Atkin referred, provided:
‘When there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, and the goods without the knowledge of the
seller have perished at the time when the contract is made, the contract is void.’
52.
 
Judge Chalmers, the draftsman of the Act, commented in the first edition of
his book on the Act, The Sale of Goods Act 1893 (1894) p. 17: ‘The rule may be
based on the ground of mutual mistake, or on the ground of impossibility of
performance.’
53.
 
He put at the forefront of the authorities that he cited in support 
Couturier
 
v.
Hastie
 
(1856) 5 HL Cas 673. That case involved the sale of a cargo of corn which,
unknown to the parties, no longer existed at the time that the contract was
concluded. Other decisions where agreements were held not to be binding were
Strickland
 
v. 
Turner
 
(1852) 7 Exch 208—the sale of an annuity upon the life of a
person who, unknown to the parties, had died, and 
Pritchard
 
v. 
Merchants’ and
Tradesman’s Mutual Life Assurance Society
 
(1858) 3 CBNS 622—an insurance
policy renewed in ignorance of the fact that the assured had died …
55.
 
Where that which is expressly identified as the subject of a contract does
not exist, the contract will necessarily be one which cannot be performed. Such a
situation can readily be identified. The position is very different where there is ‘a
mistake as to the existence of some quality of the subject matter which makes the
thing without the quality essentially different from the thing as it was believed to be’
(see 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Bros Ltd
 
[1932] AC 161 at 218). In such a situation it may be
possible to perform the letter of the contract. In support of the proposition that a
contract is void in such circumstances, Lord Atkin cited two authorities, in which he
said that the principles to be applied were to be found. The first was 
Kennedy
 
v.
Panama, New Zealand and Australian Royal Mail Co
 
(1867) LR 2 QB 580 …
60.
 
The other case to which Lord Atkin referred was 
Smith
 
v. 
Hughes
 
(1871)
LR 6 QB 597 [see 
2.2
].
61.
 
We conclude that the two authorities to which Lord Atkin referred provided
an insubstantial basis for his formulation of the test of common mistake in relation
to the quality of 
the subject matter of a contract. Lord Atkin advanced an alternative
basis for his test: the implication of a term of the same nature as that which was
applied under the doctrine of frustration, as it was then understood. In so doing he
adopted the analysis of Scrutton LJ in the Court of Appeal. It seems to us that this
was a more solid jurisprudential basis for the test of common mistake that Lord
Atkin was proposing. At the time of 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
 
the law of frustration and
common mistake had advanced hand in hand on the foundation of a common
principle. Thereafter frustration proved a more fertile ground for the development of
this principle than common mistake, and consideration of the development of the
law of frustration assists with the analysis of the law of common mistake.
[He considered the development of the law of frustration and continued]
73.
 
What do these developments in the law of frustration have to tell us about
the law of common mistake? First that the theory of the implied term is as
unrealistic when considering common mistake as when considering frustration.
Where a fundamental assumption upon which an agreement is founded proves to
be mistaken, it is not realistic to ask whether the parties impliedly agreed that in
those circumstances the contract would not be binding. The avoidance of a
contract on the ground of common mistake results from a rule of law under which,
if it transpires that one or both of the parties have agreed to do something which it
is impossible to perform, no obligation arises out of that agreement.
74.
 
In considering whether performance of the contract is impossible, it is
necessary to identify what it is that the parties agreed would be performed. This
involves looking not only at the express terms, but at any implications that may
arise out of the surrounding circumstances. In some cases it will be possible to
identify details of the ‘contractual adventure’ which go beyond the terms that are
expressly spelt out, in others it will not.
75.
 
Just as the doctrine of frustration only applies if the contract contains no
provision that covers the situation, the same should be true of common mistake. If,
on true construction of the contract, a party warrants that the subject matter of the
contract exists, or that it will be possible to perform the contract, there will be no
scope to hold the contract void on the ground of common mistake.
76.
 
If one applies the passage from the judgment of Lord Alverstone CJ in
Hobson
 
v. 
Pattenden & Co
 
(1903) 19 TLR 186 … to a case of common mistake, it
suggests that the following elements must be present if common mistake is to
avoid a contract: (i) there must be a common assumption as to the existence of a
state of affairs; (ii) there must be no warranty by either party that that state of
affairs exists; (iii) the non-existence of the state of affairs must not be attributable
to the fault of either party; (iv) the non-existence of the state of affairs must render
performance of the contract impossible; (v) the state of affairs may be the
existence, or a vital attribute, of the consideration to be provided or circumstances
which must subsist if performance of the contractual adventure is to be possible.
77.
 
The second and third of these elements are well exemplified by the
decision of the High Court of Australia in 
McRae
 
v. 
Commonwealth Disposals
Commission
 
(1951) 84 CLR 377. The Commission invited tenders for the purchase
of ‘an oil tanker lying on the Jourmaund Reef … said to contain oil’. The plaintiff
tendered successfully for the purchase, fitted out a salvage expedition at great
expense and proceeded to the reef. No tanker was to be found—it had never
existed. The plaintiff claimed damages for breach of contract. The Commission
argued that the contract was void because of a common mistake as to the
existence of the tanker.
78.
 
In the leading judgment Dixon and Fullagar JJ expressed doubt as to the
existence of a doctrine of common mistake in contract. They considered that
whether impossibility of performance discharged obligations, be the impossibility
existing at the time of the contract 
or supervening thereafter, depended solely upon
the construction of the contract. They went on, however, to consider the position if
this were not correct. They observed that the common assumption that the tanker
existed was one that was created by the Commission, without any reasonable
grounds for believing that it was true. They held at p. 408:
‘… a party cannot rely on mutual mistake where the mistake consists of a belief which is, on the one
hand, entertained by him without any reasonable ground, and, on the other hand, deliberately induced
by him in the mind of the other party.’
79.
 
They held (at p. 410) that, on its proper construction the contract included
a promise by the Commission that the tanker existed in the position specified.
Alternatively, they held that if the doctrine of mistake fell to be applied:
‘then the Commission cannot in this case rely on any mistake as avoiding the contract, because any
mistake was induced by the serious fault of their own servants, who asserted the existence of a tanker
recklessly and without any reasonable ground.’
80.
 
This seems, if we may say so, an entirely satisfactory conclusion and one
that can be reconciled with the English doctrine of mistake. That doctrine fills a gap
in the contract where it transpires that it is impossible of performance without the
fault of either party and the parties have not, expressly or by implication, dealt with
their rights and obligations in that eventuality. In 
Associated Japanese Bank
(International) Ltd
 
v. 
Crédit du Nord SA
 
[1989] 1 WLR 255, 268 Steyn J observed:
‘Logically, before one can turn to the rules as to mistake, whether at common law or in equity, one must
first determine whether the contract itself, by express or implied condition precedent or otherwise,
provides who bears the risk of the relevant mistake. It is at this hurdle that many pleas of mistake will
either fail or prove to have been unnecessary. Only if the contract is silent on the point, is there scope for
invoking mistake.’
81.
 
In 
William Sindall plc
 
v. 
Cambridgeshire CC
 
[1994] 1 WLR 1016 at 1035,
Hoffmann LJ commented that such allocation of risk can come about by rules of
general law applicable to contract, such as ‘caveat emptor’ in the law of sale of
goods or the rule that a lessor or vendor of land does not impliedly warrant that the
premises are fit for any particular purpose, so that this risk is allocated by the
contract to the lessee or purchaser.
82.
 
Thus, while we do not consider that the doctrine of common mistake can
be satisfactorily explained by an implied term, an allegation that a contract is void
for common mistake will often raise important issues of construction. Where it is
possible to perform the letter of the contract, but it is alleged that there was a
common mistake in relation to a fundamental assumption which renders
performance of the essence of the obligation impossible, it will be necessary, by
construing the contract in the light of all the material circumstances, to decide
whether this is indeed the case …
84.
 
Once the court determines that unforeseen circumstances have, indeed,
resulted in the contract being impossible of performance, it is next necessary to
determine whether, on true construction of the contract, one or other party has
undertaken responsibility for the subsistence of the assumed state of affairs. This
is another way of asking whether one or other party has undertaken the risk that it
may not prove possible to perform the contract, and the answer to this question
may well be the same as the answer to the question of whether the impossibility of
performance is attributable to the fault of one or other of the parties.
85.
 
Circumstances where a contract is void as a result of common mistake are
likely to be less common than instances of frustration. Supervening events which
defeat the contractual 
adventure will frequently not be the responsibility of either
party. Where, however, the parties agree that something shall be done which is
impossible at the time of making the agreement, it is much more likely that, on true
construction of the agreement, one or other will have undertaken responsibility for
the mistaken state of affairs. This may well explain why cases where contracts
have been found to be void in consequence of common mistake are few and far
between.
86.
 
Lord Atkin himself gave no examples of cases where a contract was
rendered void because of a mistake as to quality which made ‘the thing without the
quality essentially different from the thing as it was believed to be’. He gave a
number of examples of mistakes which did not satisfy this test, which served to
demonstrate just how narrow he considered the test to be. Indeed this is further
demonstrated by the result reached on the facts of 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
 
itself.
87.
 
Two cases where common mistake has been held to avoid the contract
under common law call for special consideration. A case which is by no means
easy to reconcile with 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
 
is 
Scott
 
v. 
Coulson
 
[1903] 2 Ch 249. A
contract for the sale of a life policy was entered into in circumstances in which both
parties believed that the assured was alive. The price was paid and the policy
assigned. The contract price was little more than the surrender value of the policy.
In fact, the assured had died before the contract was concluded and the policy
thus carried with it entitlement to the full sum assured. The vendors succeeded, in
proceedings in the Chancery Court, in having the transaction set aside. …
88.
 
This case is often erroneously treated as being on all fours with 
Strickland
v. 
Turner
—see for example in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
 
Wright J at p. 565, Greer LJ at
p. 595, and Lord Warrington at pp. 206–7. The two cases were, however, very
different. An annuity on the life of someone deceased is self-evidently a nullity. The
policy in 
Scott
 
v. 
Coulson
 
was very far from a nullity. The only way that the case
can be explained is by postulating that a life policy before decease is
fundamentally different from a life policy after decease, so that the contractual
consideration no longer existed, but had been replaced by something quite
different—ergo the contract could not be performed. Such was the explanation
given by Lord Thankerton in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
 
at p. 236.
89.
 
The other case is the decision of Steyn J in 
Associated Japanese Bank
 
v.
Crédit du Nord SA
 
[1989] 1 WLR 257. The plaintiff bank entered into an agreement
with a rogue under which he purported to sell and lease back four specific
machines. The defendant bank agreed with the plaintiff bank to guarantee the
rogue’s payments under the lease-back agreement. The machines did not, in fact,
exist. The rogue defaulted on his payments and the plaintiffs called on the
guarantee. The defendants alleged (1) that on true construction of the agreement it
was subject to an express condition precedent that the four machines existed; if
this was not correct (2) that the agreement was void at law for common mistake; if
this was not correct the agreement was voidable in equity on the ground of mistake
and had been avoided.
90.
 
The first head of defence succeeded. Steyn J went on, however, to
consider the alternative defences founded on mistake. After reviewing the
authorities on common mistake, he reached the following formulation of the law:
‘The first imperative must be that the law ought to uphold rather than destroy apparent contracts.
Secondly, the common law rules as to a mistake regarding the quality of the subject matter, like the
common law rules regarding commercial frustration, are designed to cope with the impact of unexpected
and wholly exceptional circumstances on apparent contracts. Thirdly, such a mistake in order to attract
legal consequences must substantially be shared 
by both parties, and must relate to facts as they
existed at the time the contract was made. Fourthly, and this is the point established by 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever
Brothers Ltd
 
[1932] AC 161, the mistake must render the subject matter of the contract essentially and
radically different from the subject matter which the parties believed to exist. While the civilian distinction
between the substance and attributes of the subject matter of a contract has played a role in the
development of our law (and was cited in speeches in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers Ltd
), the principle
enunciated in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers Ltd
 
is markedly narrower in scope than the civilian doctrine. It is
therefore no longer useful to invoke the civilian distinction. The principles enunciated by Lord Atkin and
Lord Thankerton represent the ratio decidendi of 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers Ltd
. Fifthly, there is a requirement
which was not specifically discussed in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers Ltd
. What happens if the party, who is
seeking to rely on the mistake, had no reasonable grounds for his belief? An extreme example is that of
the man who makes a contract with minimal knowledge of the facts to which the mistake relates but is
content that it is a good speculative risk. In my judgment a party cannot be allowed to rely on a common
mistake where the mistake consists of a belief which is entertained by him without any reasonable
grounds for such belief: cf 
McRae
 
v. 
Commonwealth Disposals Commission
 
(1951) 84 CLR 377, 408.
That is not because principles such as estoppel or negligence require it, but simply because policy and
good sense dictate that the positive rules regarding common mistake should be so qualified.’
91.
 
The detailed analysis that we have carried out leads us to concur in this
summary, subject to the proviso that the result in McRae’s case can, we believe,
be explained on the basis of construction, as demonstrated above. In agreeing
with the analysis of Steyn J, we recognise that it is at odds with comments that
Lord Denning made on more than one occasion about 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers Ltd
 
to
the effect that ‘a common mistake, even on a most fundamental matter, does not
make a contract void at law’. As to this Steyn J said at p. 267:
‘With the profoundest respect to the former Master of the Rolls I am constrained to say that in my view
his interpretation of 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers Ltd
 
does not do justice to the speeches of the majority.’
92.
 
We share both the respect and the conclusion …
93.
 
Steyn J held that the test of common mistake was satisfied. He held at p.
269:
‘For both parties the guarantee of obligations under a lease with non-existent machines was essentially
different from a guarantee of a lease with four machines which both parties at the time of the contract
believed to exist. The guarantee is an accessory contract. The non-existence of the subject matter of the
principal contract is therefore of fundamental importance. Indeed the analogy of the classic res extincta
cases, so much discussed in the authorities, is fairly close. In my judgment the stringent test of common
law mistake is satisfied: the guarantee is void ab initio.’
94.
 
Our conclusions have marched in parallel with those of Toulson J. We
admire the clarity with which he has set out his conclusions, which emphasise the
importance of a careful analysis of the contract and of the rights and obligations
created by it as an essential precursor to consideration of the effect of an alleged
mistake. We agree with him that, on the facts of the present case, the issue in
relation to common mistake turns on the question of whether the mistake as to the
distance apart of the two vessels had the effect that the services that the ‘Great
Peace’ was in a position to provide were something essentially different from that
to which the parties had agreed …
The result in this case
162.
 
We revert to the question that we left unanswered at paragraph 94. It was
unquestionably a common assumption of both parties when the contract was
concluded that the two vessels were in sufficiently close proximity to enable the
‘
Great Peace
’ to carry out the service that she was engaged to perform. Was the
distance between the two vessels so great as to confound that assumption and to
render the contractual adventure impossible of performance? If so, the appellants
would have an arguable case that the contract was void under the principle in 
Bell
v. 
Lever Brothers Ltd
.
163.
 
Toulson J addressed this issue in the following paragraph:
‘Was the “
Great Peace
” so far away from the “
Cape Providence
” at the time of the contract as to defeat
the contractual purpose—or in other words to turn it into something essentially different from that for
which the parties bargained? This is a question of fact and degree, but in my view the answer is no. If it
had been thought really necessary, the “
Cape Providence
” could have altered course so that both
vessels were heading toward each other. At a closing speed of 19 knots, it would have taken them about
22 hours to meet. A telling point is the reaction of the defendants on learning the true positions of the
vessels. They did not want to cancel the agreement until they knew if they could find a nearer vessel to
assist. Evidently the defendants did not regard the contract as devoid of purpose, or they would have
cancelled at once.’
164.
 
Mr Reeder [counsel for the appellants] has attacked this paragraph on a
number of grounds. He has submitted that the suggestion that the ‘Cape
Providence’ should have turned and steamed towards the ‘Great Peace’ is unreal.
We agree. The appellants were sending a tug from Singapore in an attempt to
salve the ‘Cape Providence’. The ‘Great Peace’ was engaged by the appellants to
act as a stand-by vessel to save human life, should this prove necessary, as an
ancillary aspect of the salvage service. The suggestion that the ‘Cape Providence’
should have turned and steamed away from the salvage tug which was on its way
towards her in order to reduce the interval before the ‘Great Peace’ was in
attendance is unrealistic.
165.
 
Next Mr Reeder submitted that it was not legitimate for the Judge to have
regard to the fact that the appellants did not want to cancel the agreement with the
‘Great Peace’ until they knew whether they could get a nearer vessel to assist. We
do not agree. This reaction was a telling indication that the fact that the vessels
were considerably further apart than the appellants had believed did not mean that
the services that the ‘Great Peace’ was in a position to provide were essentially
different from those which the parties had envisaged when the contract was
concluded. The ‘Great Peace’ would arrive in time to provide several days of escort
service. The appellants would have wished the contract to be performed but for the
adventitious arrival on the scene of a vessel prepared to perform the same
services. The fact that the vessels were further apart than both parties had
appreciated did not mean that it was impossible to perform the contractual
adventure.
166.
 
The parties entered into a binding contract for the hire of the ‘Great
Peace’. That contract gave the appellants an express right to cancel the contract
subject to the obligation to pay the ‘cancellation fee’ of 5 days hire. When they
engaged the ‘Nordfarer’ they cancelled the ‘Great Peace’. They became liable in
consequence to pay the cancellation fee. There is no injustice in this result.
167.
 
For the reasons that we have given, we would dismiss this appeal.
Commentary
A number of important issues arise out of this passage. The first is the narrowness of the
doctrine of mistake identified by the Court of Appeal. Examples of contracts held void in
consequence of common mistake are likely to remain ‘few and far between’ ([85]),
although rare cases can still be found where a common mistake is held to be sufficient to
set aside an agreement (see, for example, 
British Red Cross
 
v. 
Werry
 
[2017] EWHC 875
(Ch), where an agreement entered into in settlement of a dispute relating to the estate of
someone who was believed to have died without having made a will was set aside when a
will was subsequently discovered). But the judgment does contain a discussion of a
number of cases in which contracts were held to be void for mistake, including
Couturier
 
v. 
Hastie
 
(1856) 5 HL Cas 673 ([53], although it is not entirely clear that it is
properly analysed as a mistake case); 
Scott
 
v. 
Coulson
 
[1903] 2 Ch 249 (although doubts
are expressed about the correctness of the case at [87] and [88]); and 
Associated
Japanese Bank
 
v. 
Crédit du Nord SA
 
[1989] 1 WLR 257 ([89]–[93]). What common
elements, if any, can be identified in these cases? The key factors, in the view of the
Court of Appeal, are identified at [76] of their judgment. One difficulty with this
paragraph, apart from the multiplicity of factors identified, is that it is not altogether
easy to ascertain the relationship between the different factors. This is confirmed by the
analysis at [77]–[83] which, with respect, is not always easy to follow. Matters become
clearer at [84], where a two-stage approach is advocated. At the first stage, the court
must decide whether or not ‘the contract has become impossible of performance’ as a
result of the ‘unforeseen circumstances’ and then, secondly, the court must decide
whether ‘on the true construction of the contract, one or other party has undertaken
responsibility for the subsistence of the assumed state of affairs’.
The requirement that the contract must be ‘impossible of performance’ is likely to make
it very difficult to set aside a contract on the ground of a mistake as to quality (see [86]).
But impossibility does seem to lie at the core of mistake cases. A simple example is
provided by the case of 
Sheikh Brothers Ltd
 
v. 
Ochsner
 
[1957] AC 136. The appellants
gave to the respondents a licence to cut sisal growing on land which had been leased to
the appellants. The respondents undertook to manufacture and deliver to the appellants
‘sisal fibre in average minimum quantities of fifty tons per month’. Lord Cohen stated
(at p. 146) that ‘the licence agreement provided for something of the nature of a joint
adventure and was entered into on the basis that the sisal area was capable of producing
sisal over the period of the agreement at the average rate of 50 tons per month’. This
basis proved to be unfounded. The appellants submitted that this mistake did not go to
the foundation of the contract. The Privy Council disagreed. Lord Cohen stated (at p.
147) that:
their Lordships think that it was the very basis of the contract that the sisal area should be capable of producing
an average of 50 tons a month throughout the term of the licence. It follows that the mistake was as to a matter
of fact essential to the agreement.
The more difficult question is whether or not impossibility should be an indispensable
element in a mistake case. The cases do not, as yet, speak with one voice (
Lehman Bros
International (Europe) (in administration)
 
v. 
Exotix Partners LLP
 
[2019] EWHC 2380
(Ch), [2020] 1 All ER (Comm) 635, [190]). Authority can be found to support the
proposition that the common mistake must render performance of the contract
impossible (see 
Brennan
 
v. 
Bolt Burden (a firm)
 
[2004] EWCA Civ 1017, [2005] QB
303). On the other hand, the analogy 
with frustration suggests that the doctrine should
not be so confined and that it should extend to cases where performance in the
circumstances would be something radically different from what the parties had in
contemplation at the time of entry into the contract (
Triple Seven MSN 27521 Ltd
 
v.
Azman Air Services Ltd
 
[2018] EWHC 1348 (Comm), [2018] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 424, [62]–
[72]). The merit of the latter view is that it will assist in the assimilation of the principles
of common mistake and frustration and, at the same time, keep the doctrine within
narrow confines and so avoid creating unnecessary uncertainty.
The second point to note is the emphasis placed by the Court of Appeal upon the
importance of the construction of the contract. This approach is particularly noticeable
in relation to the analysis of 
McRae
 
v. 
Commonwealth Disposals Commission
 
(1951) 84
CLR 377 at [79]–[80] and of 
Associated Japanese Bank
 
v. 
Cr
é
dit du Nord SA
 
[1989] 1
WLR 257 at [80] and [89]. The approval of the result in 
McRae
 
is also significant.
McRae
 
has always been a problematic case as far as English law is concerned. While
most commentators are of the view that 
McRae
 
was correctly decided on its own facts,
the problem lies in reconciling it with section 6 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which
states that a contract for the sale of specific goods is void where, prior to the conclusion
of the contract, the goods have perished without the knowledge of the parties. Of course,
it is possible to reconcile 
McRae
 
with section 6 on the basis that the tanker never existed
and therefore could not ‘perish’. While this explanation may be a satisfactory one in
technical terms, it is not satisfactory in principled terms because it does not explain why
the law should distinguish between cases where the goods once existed but have
perished (which are caught by section 6 and declared to be void) and cases in which the
goods never existed (which may be valid under 
McRae
). The preferable approach is to
examine the terms of the contract in all cases in order to ascertain whether or not the
rule contained in section 6 has been displaced by the terms of the contract. On this view
section 6 is not a mandatory rule of law. It is a default rule and the parties can contract
out of it by the simple device of making a promise to the effect that the subject matter of
the contract exists. This is the explanation given of 
McRae
 
at [79], where it is stated that
‘on its proper construction the contract included a promise by the Commission that the
tanker existed in the position specified’.
Equally, this exercise in construction may produce the result that no such promise was
made. Such was the case in 
Couturier
 
v. 
Hastie
 
(1856) 5 HLC 673 (discussed at [53]).
The parties entered into a contract for the sale of a cargo of corn on what were in effect
c.i.f. terms. At the time the contract was concluded the corn was believed to be in transit
from Salonica to the United Kingdom. But, before the contract was made, and unknown
to both parties, the corn had deteriorated to such an extent that the master of the ship
sold it. The seller argued that the buyer remained liable for the price of the corn because
he had bought an ‘interest in the adventure’ or such rights as the seller had under the
shipping documents. The House of Lords rejected the seller’s argument, holding that the
subject matter of the contract was not the rights of the sellers under the shipping
documents but the corn and that, since the corn did not exist, there was a total failure of
consideration and the buyer was not liable to pay the price. The case has subsequently
been rationalized as an example of a common mistake as to the existence of the subject
matter of the contract, although the word ‘mistake’ was nowhere mentioned in the
judgment of the House of Lords. Indeed, Lord Chancellor Cranworth stated (at p. 681)
that ‘the whole question turns upon the construction of the contract which was entered
into between the parties’. He continued: ‘the contract plainly imports that there was
something which was to be sold at the time of the contract, and something to be
purchased.’ On the facts there was nothing to be sold and accordingly there could be no
liability to pay the price. It is therefore necessary to ascertain the obligations 
which have
been assumed by the parties under the contract before deciding whether or not the
contract can be set aside on the ground of mistake.
The final point of significance relates to the analogy drawn by the Court of Appeal
between cases of common mistake and cases of frustration. At [62]–[72] of their
judgment (a passage which has been omitted from the extract), the Court of Appeal
discuss a number of leading frustration cases which will be discussed in more detail in
Chapter 21
, namely 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
(1863) 3 B & S 826 (
21.1
); 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
 
[1903]
2 KB 740 (
21.5.3
); and 
National Carriers Ltd
 
v. 
Panalpina (Northern) Ltd
 
[1981] AC
675 (
21.7
). What lessons do we learn from the analogy? The first lesson is that the
implied term technique originally used in frustration cases such as 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
is
‘unrealistic’ (
21.1
) and so should not be adopted in the context of common mistake (see
[73]). The second point is that the doctrines of common mistake and frustration do
share important common elements (see [74], [82], and [85]). The closeness of the
relationship between the two doctrines can be demonstrated by the ‘coronation cases’.
The leading case, 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
 
[1903] 2 KB 740, is a frustration case and it is discussed
in more detail in 
Chapter 21
 
(
21.5.3
). The coronation procession of King Edward VII was
cancelled because of the King’s illness. Many rooms along the procession route had been
hired for the purpose of viewing the coronation. In most of the cases (such as 
Krell
 
v.
Henry
) the contracts were concluded before the coronation was cancelled, but there is
one case, 
Griffith
 
v. 
Brymer
 
(1903) 19 TLR 434, where the contract was entered into
shortly after the decision to cancel the coronation had been made but both parties were
unaware of the fact of the cancellation. The issue in these cases is the same: whether
they are cases of frustration or mistake. The issue in both relates to the impact of an
unforeseen event on the obligations contained in the contract. The difference between
common mistake and frustration is simply one of timing. In the case of mistake the
unforeseen event has, unknown to both parties, already occurred at the moment of entry
into the contract, whereas in the case of frustration the event occurs after the formation
of the contract. The common element is therefore that both doctrines are concerned
with the allocation of risk of unforeseen events. This being the case, the courts in
mistake cases should be able to draw on frustration cases and vice versa. But the
difference in timing does require that care be exercised when drawing the analogy. As
the Court of Appeal acknowledged in 
Great Peace
 
([85]), ‘circumstances where a
contract is void as a result of common mistake are likely to be less common than
instances of frustration’. The reason for this is that the parties can, with greater
diligence, find out the true position at the moment of entry into the contract, whereas
they cannot discover what will happen in the future. This being the case, the law ought
to be slower to relieve a party from the consequences of his failure to discover the true
state of affairs at the moment of entry into the contract than from the consequences of
his failure to predict the future course of events. But the difference is one of degree, not
kind.
 
‘By natural reason (or common sense) useless’.

Mistake in Equity
The authority of 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Bros Ltd
 
was challenged by the decision of the Court of
Appeal in 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
[1950] 1 KB 671. It was obviously not open to the Court of
Appeal in 
Solle
 
to refuse to follow 
Bell
, given that 
Bell
 
is a decision of the House of
Lords. The technique used in 
Solle
 
was to distinguish 
Bell
 
on the ground that it was an
authority on the doctrine of mistake at common law and that it did not determine the
scope of the doctrine of mistake in equity. According to the Court of Appeal in 
Solle
, the
doctrine of mistake in equity differed from the doctrine of mistake at common law in
three respects. First the scope of the 
doctrine was wider. While the courts in equity also
asked whether or not the mistake was ‘fundamental’, the definition of ‘fundamental’ in
equity was more liberal and so encompassed a broader range of mistakes. Secondly, the
effect of the mistake was different in that mistake in equity rendered a contract voidable,
whereas mistake at law renders a contract void. Thirdly, and finally, the courts in equity
had greater remedial flexibility when setting aside a contract, in that they could set the
contract aside ‘on terms’; that is to say they could, within limits, adjust the rights and
responsibilities of the parties.
Solle
 
was decided back in 1949 and it was relied upon by the Court of Appeal and first
instance judges in a handful of cases prior to the decision of the Court of Appeal in
Great Peace
. During this period the courts were aware of the uneasy relationship
between 
Solle
 
and 
Bell
. The relationship between the two cases was rationalized by
Steyn J in 
Associated Japanese Bank
 
v. 
Cr
é
dit du Nord SA
 
[1989] 1 WLR 257, 268 in
the following terms:
[A] narrow doctrine of common law mistake (as enunciated in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Bros Ltd
), supplemented by the
more flexible doctrine of mistake in equity (as developed in 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
and later cases), seems to me to be
an entirely sensible and satisfactory state of the law.
On this view the role of equitable mistake was a ‘supplementary’ one and Steyn J
explained the relationship between common law and equitable mistake in sequential
terms:
Where common law mistake has been pleaded, the court must first consider this plea. If the contract is held to
be void, no question of mistake in equity arises. But, if the contract is held to be valid, a plea of mistake in equity
may still have to be considered.
The Court of Appeal in 
Great Peace
 
took a much more robust line and held that 
Solle
was inconsistent with 
Bell
 
and should be disapproved. It is obviously an unusual step for
a Court of Appeal to disapprove one of its own decisions, especially a decision that was
regarded as good authority for over fifty years. It is therefore important to examine 
Solle
itself before going on to consider the reasons given by the Court of Appeal for
disapproving 
Solle
 
and the cases decided in reliance upon it.
SOLLE V. BUTCHER
[1950] 1 KB 671, Court of Appeal
Solle and Butcher were partners in an estate agency. In 1947 Butcher took a lease
of Maywood House, a building which contained five flats. Maywood House had
been damaged by a land mine and Butcher took the lease with the intention of
repairing the damage. In 1939 Flat 1 had been let for £140 per year. Solle and
Butcher discussed what rent could be charged after the repairs were done. Solle
told Butcher that he could charge £250 per year for Flat 1 because the rent was
not restricted to the £140 charged in 1939 under the Rent Restriction Acts. Butcher
relied on Solle’s statement and did not attempt to calculate the additions, permitted
under the Rent Restriction Acts by virtue of the repairs, to the £140 charged in
1939, on the assumption that it was the maximum rent. The additions would have
brought the maximum rent to about £250. On 29 September 1947 Butcher let Flat
1 to 
Solle for £250 per year. Once the lease was executed no notice of intention to
increase the rent could be given under the Rent Restriction Acts.
Solle sued Butcher claiming that the maximum rent was £140. Butcher claimed
rescission of the lease on the ground of: (i) common mistake of fact, (ii) innocent
material misrepresentation, and (iii) estoppel. The trial judge held that Flat 1
retained its identity notwithstanding the repairs and that the maximum rent was
therefore £140 per year. He also held that there was no mistake of fact, though
possibly one of law as both parties believed the Rent Restriction Acts did not apply.
On appeal the Court of Appeal held, Jenkins LJ dissenting, that the lease should
be set aside on terms.
Denning LJ
It is quite plain that the parties were under a mistake. They thought that the flat
was not tied down to a controlled rent, whereas in fact it was. In order to see
whether the lease can be avoided for this mistake it is necessary to remember that
mistake is of two kinds: first, mistake which renders the contract void, that is, a
nullity from the beginning, which is the kind of mistake which was dealt with by the
courts of common law; and, secondly, mistake which renders the contract not void,
but voidable, that is, liable to be set aside on such terms as the court thinks fit,
which is the kind of mistake which was dealt with by the courts of equity. Much of
the difficulty which has attended this subject has arisen because, before the fusion
of law and equity, the courts of common law, in order to do justice in the case in
hand, extended this doctrine of mistake beyond its proper limits and held contracts
to be void which were really only voidable, a process which was capable of being
attended with much injustice to third persons who had bought goods or otherwise
committed themselves on the faith that there was a contract. In the well-known
case of 
Cundy
 
v. 
Lindsay
 
(1876–8) 1 QBD 348; 3 App Cas 459, Cundy suffered
such an injustice. He bought the handkerchiefs from the rogue, Blenkarn, before
the Judicature Acts came into operation. Since the fusion of law and equity, there is
no reason to continue this process, and it will be found that only those contracts
are now held void in which the mistake was such as to prevent the formation of
any contract at all.
Let me first consider mistakes which render a contract a nullity. All previous
decisions on this subject must now be read in the light of 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Bros Ltd
[1932] AC 161, 222, 224, 225–7, 236. The correct interpretation of that case, to my
mind, is that, once a contract has been made, that is to say, once the parties,
whatever their inmost states of mind, have to all outward appearances agreed with
sufficient certainty in the same terms on the same subject matter, then the contract
is good unless and until it is set aside for failure of some condition on which the
existence of the contract depends, or for fraud, or on some equitable ground.
Neither party can rely on his own mistake to say it was a nullity from the beginning,
no matter that it was a mistake which to his mind was fundamental, and no matter
that the other party knew that he was under a mistake. A fortiori, if the other party
did not know of the mistake, but shared it …
Applying these principles, it is clear that here there was a contract. The parties
agreed in the same terms on the same subject matter. It is true that the landlord
was under a mistake which was to him fundamental: he would not for one moment
have considered letting the flat for seven years if it meant that he could only
charge 140l. a year for it. He made the fundamental mistake of believing that the
rent he could charge was not tied down to a controlled rent; but, whether it was his
own mistake or a mistake common to both him and the tenant, it is not a ground for
saying that the lease was from the beginning a nullity …
Let me next consider mistakes which render a contract voidable, that is, liable
to be set aside on some equitable ground. Whilst presupposing that a contract was
good at law, or at any rate not void, the court of equity would often relieve a party
from the consequences of his own mistake, so long as it could do so without
injustice to third parties. The court, it was said, had power to set aside the contract
whenever it was of opinion that it was unconscientious for the other party to avail
himself of the legal advantage which he had obtained: 
Torrance
 
v. 
Bolton
 
(1872)
LR 8 Ch 118, 124 per James LJ.
The court had, of course, to define what it considered to be unconscientious,
but in this respect equity has shown a progressive development. It is now clear
that a contract will be set aside if the mistake of the one party has been induced by
a material misrepresentation of the other, even though it was not fraudulent or
fundamental; or if one party, knowing that the other is mistaken about the terms of
an offer, or the identity of the person by whom it is made, lets him remain under his
delusion and concludes a contract on the mistaken terms instead of pointing out
the mistake …
A contract is also liable in equity to be set aside if the parties were under a
common misapprehension either as to facts or as to their relative and respective
rights, provided that the misapprehension was fundamental and that the party
seeking to set it aside was not himself at fault …
The principle so established by 
Cooper
 
v. 
Phibbs
 
(1867) LR 2 HL 149 has been
repeatedly acted on: …
Applying that principle to this case, the facts are that the plaintiff, the tenant,
was a surveyor who was employed by the defendant, the landlord, not only to
arrange finance for the purchase of the building and to negotiate with the rating
authorities as to the new rateable values, but also to let the flats. He was the agent
for letting, and he clearly formed the view that the building was not controlled. He
told the valuation officer so. He advised the defendant what were the rents which
could be charged. He read to the defendant an opinion of counsel relating to the
matter, and told him that in his opinion he could charge 250l. and that there was no
previous control. He said that the flats came outside the Act and that the defendant
was ‘clear’. The defendant relied on what the plaintiff told him, and authorized the
plaintiff to let at the rentals which he had suggested. The plaintiff not only let the
four other flats to other people for a long period of years at the new rentals, but
also took one himself for seven years at 250l. a year. Now he turns round and
says, quite unashamedly, that he wants to take advantage of the mistake to get the
flat at 140l. a year for seven years instead of the 250l. a year, which is not only the
rent he agreed to pay but also the fair and economic rent; and it is also the rent
permitted by the Acts on compliance with the necessary formalities. If the rules of
equity have become so rigid that they cannot remedy such an injustice, it is time
we had a new equity, to make good the omissions of the old. But, in my view, the
established rules are amply sufficient for this case …
There was clearly a common mistake, or, as I would prefer to describe it, a
common misapprehension, which was fundamental and in no way due to any fault
of the defendant; and 
Cooper
 
v. 
Phibbs
 
LR 2 HL 149 affords ample authority for
saying that, by reason of the common misapprehension, this lease can be set
aside on such terms as the court thinks fit.
The fact that the lease has been executed is no bar to this relief….
In the ordinary way, of course, rescission is only granted when the parties can
be restored to substantially the same position as that in which they were before the
contract was made; but, as Lord Blackburn said in 
Erlanger
 
v. 
New Sombrero
Phosphate Co
 
(1878) 3 App Cas 1218, 1278–9. ‘The practice has always been for
a court of equity to give this relief whenever, by the exercise of its powers, it can do
what is practically just, though it cannot restore the 
parties precisely to the state
they were in before the contract.’ That indeed was what was done in 
Cooper
 
v.
Phibbs
 
LR 2 HL 149. Terms were imposed so as to do what was practically just.
What terms then, should be imposed here?
I think that this court should … impose terms which will enable the tenant to
choose either to stay on at the proper rent or to go out.
Bucknill LJ
 
held that the lease should be set aside on the ground that there was a
common mistake of fact as the repairs made such a substantial alteration to the
building as to make it a different flat. 
Jenkins LJ
, dissenting, held that there was
no common mistake of fact but a common mistake of law as both parties believed
that the Rent Restriction Acts did not have the effect of making £140 the maximum
rent.
Commentary
The judgment of Denning LJ in 
Solle
 
demonstrates all three features of mistake in
equity which distinguish it from its common law counterpart: (i) the nature of the
mistake which entitles the court to intervene is described in more liberal terms, (ii) the
mistake rendered the contract voidable rather than void, and (iii) the lease was set aside
on terms.
Solle
 
was followed in a number of decisions in the latter part of the twentieth century. It
perhaps suffices to cite one of these cases, namely the decision of the Court of Appeal in
Magee
 
v. 
Pennine Insurance Co Ltd
 
[1969] 2 QB 507. In 1961 Thomas Magee, who was
then aged 58 and could not drive, bought a car. The seller completed an insurance
proposal form which Thomas Magee signed. The form stated that Thomas Magee held a
provisional licence and that he and his elder son John Magee, then aged 35 and the
holder of an annual licence, would drive the car in addition to his younger son. By
signing the proposal Thomas Magee declared that these details were true. In fact,
Thomas Magee held no licence and wanted the car for his younger son John J Magee,
then aged 18, to drive. Pennine Insurance Co Ltd issued a policy of insurance to Thomas
Magee on the basis of the proposal. The policy was renewed each year. On 25 April 1965
John J Magee wrecked the car. Thomas Magee claimed £600 under the policy. On 12
May 1965 Pennine offered to settle his claim for £385. Thomas Magee accepted the
offer. Pennine later discovered that the details in the proposal were incorrect and
refused to pay. Thomas Magee brought an action claiming £385 under the policy or the
compromise agreement contained in the offer of 12 May 1965. Pennine argued that it
was entitled to repudiate its liability under the policy and the agreement. The judge held
that Pennine was entitled to repudiate the policy because of the incorrect details in the
proposal. However the judge held that Pennine was liable to Thomas Magee for £385
under the agreement. On appeal a majority of the Court of Appeal (Winn LJ dissenting)
held that in entering into the agreement both parties were under the common
fundamental mistake that Thomas Magee had a valid claim under the policy and that
Pennine were not entitled to have the policy set aside. This case raises, in a stark form,
the problem of the relationship between the doctrine of mistake in equity and 
Bell
because the mistake that was made in 
Magee
 
was the same as that made in 
Bell
. In both
cases a payment was made in the belief that there was a contractual obligation to make a
payment and a contractual entitlement to receive the payment, when in fact there was
no such obligation to pay because of an entitlement in the payor to set aside the contract
which created the payment obligation.
The tension between 
Bell
 
and 
Solle
 
was resolved in 
Great Peace
 
when the Court of
Appeal concluded that 
Solle
 
should be disapproved on the ground that it was
inconsistent with the decision of the House of Lords in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Bros
. The Court of
Appeal’s analysis of equitable mistake was divided into three parts. The first part
consisted of an analysis of common mistake in equity prior to 
Bell
. The focus of
attention in this part of the judgment was upon the decision of the House of Lords in
Cooper
 
v. 
Phibbs
 
(1867) LR 2 HL 149. The second part was an analysis of the effect of
Bell
 
on mistake in equity, while the third part consisted of a discussion of the effect of
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
. The extract that follows consists of the conclusion of the Court of
Appeal in relation to the effect of 
Bell
 
on mistake in equity ([118]) and the final sections
of the judgment in which the Court of Appeal set outs its conclusions in relation to the
line of authority represented by 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
([153]–[161]).
118. These passages demonstrate that the House of Lords in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
 
considered that the
intervention of equity, as demonstrated in 
Cooper
 
v. 
Phibbs
, took place in circumstances where the common
law would have ruled the contract void for mistake. We do not find it conceivable that the House of Lords
overlooked an equitable right in Lever Brothers to rescind the agreement, notwithstanding that the agreement
was not void for mistake at common law. The jurisprudence established no such right. Lord Atkin’s test for
common mistake that avoided a contract, while narrow, broadly reflected the circumstances where equity had
intervened to excuse performance of a contract assumed to be binding in law …
153.
 
A number of cases, albeit a small number, in the course of the last 50 years have purported to follow
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
, yet none of them defines the test of mistake that gives rise to the equitable jurisdiction to
rescind in a manner that distinguishes this from the test of a mistake that renders a contract void in law, as
identified in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
. This is, perhaps, not surprising, for Lord Denning, the author of the test in
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
, set 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
 
at nought. It is possible to reconcile 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
and 
Magee
 
v.
Pennine Insurance
 
with 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
 
only by postulating that there are two categories of mistake, one
that renders a contract void at law and one that renders it voidable in equity. Although later cases have
proceeded on this basis, it is not possible to identify that proposition in the judgment of any of the three Lords
Justices, Denning, Bucknill or Fenton Atkinson, who participated in the majority decisions in the former two
cases. Nor, over 50 years, has it proved possible to define satisfactorily two different qualities of mistake, one
operating in law and one in equity.
154.
 
In 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
Denning LJ identified the requirement of a common misapprehension that was
‘fundamental’, and that adjective has been used to describe the mistake in those cases which have followed 
Solle
v. 
Butcher
. We do not find it possible to distinguish, by a process of definition, a mistake which is ‘fundamental’
from Lord Atkin’s mistake as to quality which ‘makes the thing contracted for essentially different from the
thing that it was believed to be’.
155.
 
A common factor in 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
and the cases which have followed it can be identified. The effect
of the mistake has been to make the contract a particularly bad bargain for one of the parties. Is there a
principle of equity which justifies the court in rescinding a contract where a common mistake has produced this
result?
‘Equity is … a body of rules or principles which form an appendage to the general rules of law, or a gloss
upon them. In origin at least, it represents the attempt of the English legal system to meet a problem
which confronts all legal systems reaching a certain stage of development. In order to ensure the smooth
running of society it is necessary to formulate general rules which work well enough in the majority of
cases. Sooner or later, however, cases arise in which, in some unforeseen set of facts, the general rules
produce substantial unfairness …’ (
Snell’s Equity
 
(30th edn, 2000) p. 4, para 1–03).
156.
 
Thus the premise of equity’s intrusion into the effects of the common law is that the common law rule
in question is seen in the particular case to work injustice, and for some reason the common law cannot cure
itself. But it is difficult to see how that can apply here. Cases of fraud and misrepresentation, and undue
influence, are all catered for under other existing and uncontentious equitable rules. We are only concerned
with the question whether relief might be given for common mistake in circumstances wider than those
stipulated in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brother
s. But that, surely, is a question as to where the common law should draw the
line; not whether, given the common law rule, it needs to be mitigated by application of some other doctrine.
The common law has drawn the line in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
. The effect of 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
is not to supplement
or mitigate the common law; it is to say that 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
 
was wrongly decided.
157.
 
Our conclusion is that it is impossible to reconcile 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
with 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
. The
jurisdiction asserted in the former case has not developed. It has been a fertile source of academic debate, but in
practice it has given rise to a handful of cases that have merely emphasised the confusion of this area of our
jurisprudence. In paragraphs 110 to 121 of his judgment, Toulson J has demonstrated the extent of that
confusion. If coherence is to be restored to this area of our law, it can only be by declaring that there is no
jurisdiction to grant rescission of a contract on the ground of common mistake where that contract is valid and
enforceable on ordinary principles of contract law. That is the conclusion of Toulson J. Do the principles of case
precedent permit us to endorse it? What is the correct approach where this court concludes that a decision of
the Court of Appeal cannot stand with an earlier decision of the House of Lords? There are two decisions which
bear on this question.
[The judgment considered two decisions in which it was held that the Court of Appeal should apply the
law laid down by the House of Lords and refuse to follow the decision of the Court of Appeal and
continued]
160.
 
We have been in some doubt as to whether this line of authority goes far enough to permit us to hold
that 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
is not good law. We are very conscious that we are not only scrutinising the reasoning of
Lord Denning in 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
and in 
Magee
 
v. 
Pennine Insurance Co
, but are also faced with a number of
later decisions in which Lord Denning’s approach has been approved and followed. Further, a Division of this
Court has made it clear in 
West Sussex Properties Ltd
 
v. 
Chichester DC
 
[2000] All ER (D) 887 that they felt
bound by 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
. However, it is to be noticed that while junior counsel in the court below in the 
West
Sussex Properties
 
case had sought to challenge the correctness of 
Solle
, in the Court of Appeal leading counsel
accepted that it was good law unless and until overturned by their Lordships’ House. In this case we have heard
full argument, which has provided what we believe has been the first opportunity in this court for a full and
mature consideration of the relation between 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers Ltd
 
and 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
. In the light of that
consideration we can see no way that 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
 
can stand with 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers
. In these
circumstances we can see no option but so to hold.
161.
 
We can understand why the decision in 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Brothers Ltd
 
did not find favour with Lord
Denning. An equitable jurisdiction to grant rescission on terms where a common fundamental mistake has
induced a contract gives greater flexibility than a doctrine of common law which holds the contract void in such
circumstances. Just as the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 was needed to temper the effect of the
common law doctrine of frustration, so there is scope for legislation to give greater flexibility to our law of
mistake than the common law allows.
Commentary
This is a bold decision. On its facts the decision appears correct. Factually, the case
would have been more interesting had the ‘Great Peace’ been two or three days away
from the stricken vessel. As it was, the impact of the mistake on the contract was
probably insufficient even to satisfy the test laid down by Denning LJ in 
Solle
. So, on its
facts, 
Great Peace
 
was correctly decided. The difficulty with the case lies in its
formulation of the legal principles.
The conclusion that 
Solle
 
‘cannot stand’ with 
Bell
 
is probably right in the sense that it is
almost inconceivable ‘that the House of Lords overlooked an equitable right in Lever
Bros to rescind the agreement, notwithstanding that the agreement was not void for
mistake at common law’ ([118]). A greater difficulty arises from the fact that the Court of
Appeal had followed 
Solle
 
on a number of occasions and there is a respectable case for
saying that the decision to overrule 
Solle
 
should have been left to the House of Lords
(and now of course it would be a matter for the Supreme Court). On the facts there was
no need for the Court of Appeal to take the step of disapproving 
Solle
. They could have
held, quite simply, that the mistake in this case was, on any view, insufficient to set aside
the agreement either at law or in equity. In practical terms it is likely that 
Great Peace
will be the last word on the issue unless a case goes up to the Supreme Court. It is
probably unlikely that a subsequent Court of Appeal will depart from 
Great Peace
 
on the
ground that the Court of Appeal in 
Great Peace
 
mistakenly concluded that 
Solle
 
was
inconsistent with 
Bell
 
v. 
Lever Bros
.
As for 
Solle
 
itself, it would appear that it should now be regarded as having been
wrongly decided. It was certainly wrong in terms of legal principle. But was it wrong on
its facts? Here it is interesting to contrast the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Great
Peace
 
with the decision of Toulson J at first instance ([2001] All ER (D) 152 (Nov)). He
stated at [77]:
Standing back from 
Solle
 
v. 
Butcher
, the striking feature of the case on the facts is that the plaintiff himself, a
surveyor, had led the defendant into his mistaken belief. It would seem unjust that he should be allowed to reap
a benefit from doing so.
In his judgment (at [118]) he stated that he was ‘leaving aside cases where one party’s
mistake is the product of fraud, misrepresentation or unconscionable dealing by the
other, or where one party is aware that the other is proceeding under a mistake as to the
terms of the bargain purportedly being made’. The Court of Appeal does not consider
this aspect of 
Solle
. To what extent is it possible to outflank the decision in 
Great Peace
by submitting that there has been ‘unconscionable dealing’ by the party seeking to
uphold the contract?
The final aspect of 
Great Peace
 
is the reference in paragraph [161] to the flexibility
which mistake in equity injected into the law. The statement that ‘there is scope for
legislation to give greater flexibility to our law of mistake than the common law allows’ is
a little surprising given that it was unnecessary for the Court of Appeal to excise the
equitable jurisdiction in the way that they did. Having judicially removed the flexibility
that was present in the law, they then invite Parliament to re-introduce that flexibility.
The analogy drawn with the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 is also rather
dubious. The 1943 Act (on which see 
21.6
) regulates the remedial consequences of a
contract that has already been discharged, whereas the effect of the decision of the Court
of Appeal in 
Great Peace
 
is to hold that the contract is still binding on the parties and, if
it is still binding, it is difficult to see on what basis a greater degree of flexibility should
be introduced into the law.

Reform?
If there is a desire to introduce a greater degree of flexibility into the law, then
consideration ought to be given to Articles 4:102–4:105 of the Principles of European
Contract Law. Articles 4:103 and 4:105 in particular seem to give the courts greater
flexibility both in terms of the types of mistake which give rise to a claim for relief and in
terms of the remedial powers available to the court.
Article 4:102—Initial impossibility
A contract is not invalid merely because at the time it was concluded performance of the obligation assumed
was impossible, or because a party was not entitled to dispose of the assets to which the contract relates.
Article 4:103—Fundamental mistake as to Facts or Law
A party may avoid a contract for mistake of fact or law existing when the contract was concluded if:
the mistake was caused by information given by the other party; or
the other party knew or ought to have known of the mistake and it was contrary to good
faith and fair dealing to leave the mistaken party in error; or
the other party made the same mistake, and
the other party knew or ought to have known that the mistaken party, had it known the truth,
would not have entered the contract or would have done so only on fundamentally different
terms.
However a party may not avoid the contract if:
in the circumstances its mistake was inexcusable, or
the risk of the mistake was assumed, or in the circumstances should be borne, by it.
Article 4:104—Inaccuracy in communication
An inaccuracy in the expression or transmission of a statement is to be treated as a mistake of the person who
made or sent the statement and Article 4.103 applies.
Article 4:105—Adaptation of contract
If a party is entitled to avoid the contract for mistake but the other party indicates that it is willing to
perform, or actually does perform, the contract as it was understood by the party entitled to avoid it, the
contract is to be treated as if it had been concluded as that party understood it. The other party must
indicate its willingness to perform, or render such performance, promptly after being informed of the
(2)
(3)
(1)
(a)
(b)
(i)
(ii)
(c)
manner in which the party entitled to avoid it understood the contract and before that party acts in
reliance on any notice of avoidance.
After such indication or performance the right to avoid is lost and any earlier notice of avoidance is
ineffective.
Where both parties have made the same mistake, the court may at the request of either party bring the
contract into accordance with what might reasonably have been agreed had the mistake not occurred.
An alternative framework for reform has been put forward by Professor Beale (H Beale,
Mistake and Non-Disclosure of Facts: Models for English Contract Law
 
(Oxford
University Press, 2012)). In his book, based on a series of lectures, he contrasts English
law with the law of a number of other jurisdictions (both common law and civilian) and
in the light of various proposals to harmonize contract law at a European or global level
(including the provisions of the Principles of European Contract Law set out earlier). He
is critical of the narrowness of the doctrine of mistake as it operates in English law,
particularly the rule that relief is not available where one party has made a mistake
about the facts underlying the contract, even if the other party is fully aware both of the
fact that the mistake has been made and that the mistaken party would never have made
the contract had they known the truth. In his view (at p. 30) this rule is ‘difficult to
square with morality’. Instead (at p. 98) he puts forward the following ‘provisional
proposal’ for consideration:
A party may avoid a contract on the ground of a mistake of fact or law if:
the party, but for the mistake, would only have concluded the contract on fundamentally different
terms, or would not have concluded a contract at all, and
the other party knew of the first party’s mistake and its importance but, contrary to good faith
and fair dealing, caused the contract to be concluded by leaving the mistaken party in error
unless
the mistake was merely as to the value of the performance the mistaken party was to give
or receive or
the risk of the mistake was assumed, or in the circumstances should be borne, by the
mistaken party.
A party who had the right to avoid under this provision should also have a right to claim damages
to put him into the position he would have been in had the mistake been pointed out.
While Professor Beale notes (at p. 99) that this proposal would be ‘less certain than the
current law’ he concludes that it would ‘nonetheless be workable’. In addition to his
proposal, he puts forward the following questions for consultation:
Should the same apply when the non-mistaken party did not have actual knowledge of the importance of the
mistake to the mistaken party but should have known of it?
Should the same apply when the non-mistaken party did not have actual knowledge of the fact that the first
party was mistaken but should have known of it?
Do you think that English law should develop along the lines suggested by Professor
Beale?
16.7
 
Rectification
The mistake made by the parties may relate not to the making of the contract but to the
recording of it. In such a case the parties may ask the court to rectify the document in
order to make it accord with the document they intended to draw up. The idea behind
rectification seems straightforward but the remedy has in fact given rise to a
considerable amount of difficulty in recent years.
The first difficulty concerns the relationship between rectification and the principles
applied by the courts to the interpretation of contracts. As we shall see, rectification is a
remedy that is available within narrow limits. To some extent, the restrictive rules on
rectification can be avoided by an application of Lord Hoffmann’s restatement of the
principles by which contractual documents are to be interpreted (see 
11.3
). His fourth
principle recognizes that it is possible to conclude that ‘the parties must, for whatever
reason, have used the wrong words or syntax’ and his fifth principle states that ‘if one
would … conclude from the background that something must have gone wrong with the
language, the law does not require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which
they plainly could not have had’. In 
Cherry Tree Investments Ltd
 
v. 
Landmain Ltd
[2012] EWCA Civ 736, [2013] Ch 305, [62] Arden LJ described this as a process of
‘corrective interpretation, that is, interpretation to correct a mistake’. The power of the
court to engage in ‘corrective interpretation’ appears to be broader than the ability of a
court to order that a contract be rectified, and this has led some commentators to claim
that these developments in the law relating to the interpretation of contracts have
rendered rectification ‘largely superfluous’, at least in the context of the rectification of
contracts for mistakes of fact (see A Burrows, ‘Construction and Rectification’ in A
Burrows and E Peel (eds), 
Contract Terms
 
(Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 77, 99).
This view was noted by Lewison LJ in 
Cherry Tree Investments Ltd
 
v. 
Landmain Ltd
[2012] EWCA Civ 736, [2013] Ch 305, [90]–[91], but he concluded (at [98]) that the
facts of that case demonstrated that ‘there is still a useful role for rectification to play’. In
particular, rectification may be able to reach cases which are beyond ‘corrective
interpretation’. For example, corrective interpretation may not be possible where, as in
Cherry Tree Investments
, the parties have failed to provide for a particular
circumstance or have mistakenly omitted a particular clause. In other words, the more
serious the error or omission, the more likely it is that the courts will conclude that it is
beyond the reach of corrective interpretation and is properly a case where, if there is to
be a remedy, it is to be found in rectification (although it must be conceded that in
Chartbrook Ltd
 
v. 
Persimmon Homes Ltd
 
[2009] UKHL 38, [2009] 1 AC 1101, [25],
Lord Hoffmann stated that there is no ‘limit to the amount of red ink or verbal
rearrangement or correction which the court is allowed’ when engaging in what is now
known as corrective interpretation).
While the rise of corrective interpretation may have resulted in a diminution in the
practical importance of rectification, it would be going too far to conclude that
rectification is now redundant. Rectification remains of practical significance, in large
part because prior negotiations are admissible in evidence in a rectification claim when,
as we have seen (
11.4.4
), they are not generally admissible where the issue is one that
relates to the interpretation of the contract. This means that a court seeking to ascertain
whether something has gone wrong with the language of the contract cannot, when
seeking to interpret the contractual documents, have regard to the prior negotiations but
it can do so when considering whether or not rectify the contract. This is a point of real
practical importance given that it is the prior negotiations that may provide the best
evidence that something has indeed gone wrong with the language of the contract (for
an example of this process see 
Tartsinis
 
v. 
Navona Management Co
 
[2015] EWHC 57
(Comm)). Rectification also differs from interpretation in that the interpretation of a
contract is governed by an objective test of intention, whereas rectification, at least in
certain cases (see later), permits the introduction into evidence of the subjective
intentions of the parties. Finally in this context it should be noted that rectification is an
equitable claim and, as such, is ‘subject to somewhat different rules from interpretation’.
In particular, rectification is a discretionary remedy, albeit that the principles applicable
to such a claim ‘should be as clear and predictable in their application 
as possible’
(
Daventry District Council
 
v. 
Daventry & District Housing Ltd
 
[2011] EWCA Civ 1153,
[2012] 1 WLR 1333, [194]).
The second difficulty with rectification relates to the categorization of the claims that fall
within its scope. It is now customary to divide the cases into two groups. Thus Lord
Hoffmann, speaking extrajudicially (‘Rectifying Rectification’ TECBAR Lecture, 21
November 2018) has stated that ‘we have two forms of rectification, based on altogether
different principles’. The first is rectification of a document because it does not reflect
what the parties have agreed, where the underlying moral principle is ‘that parties
should keep their promises to each other’ and so should be bound by what they agreed
to record in the document and not by a document which does not give effect to that
agreement. The second group consists of cases where one party subjectively knows that
the other party is mistaken about the terms of the contract. In such cases the mistaken
party may be entitled to rectification, and the underlying moral principle is ‘that persons
negotiating a contract have to observe certain standards of good faith’. We shall examine
both groups of cases, commencing with the second group.
This leads to the third difficulty, which lies in determining when a person who
subjectively knows of the mistake of the other party will be precluded from enforcing
these mistaken terms, and the innocent party can obtain rectification of the contract. It
is clear that unilateral mistake will not suffice of itself to entitle a claimant to
rectification. In 
Riverlate Properties Ltd
 
v. 
Paul
 
[1975] Ch 133, 140–141, Russell LJ
stated:
Is the lessor entitled to rescission of the lease on the mere ground that it made a serious mistake in the drafting
of the lease which it put forward and subsequently executed, when (a) the lessee did not share the mistake, (b)
the lessee did not know that the document did not give effect to the lessor’s intention, and (c) the mistake of the
lessor was in no way attributable to anything said or done by the lessee? … In point of principle, we cannot find
that this should be so. If reference be made to principles of equity, it operates on conscience. If conscience is
clear at the time of the transaction, why should equity disrupt the transaction? If a man may be said to have
been fortunate in obtaining a property at a bargain price, or on terms that make it a good bargain, because the
other party unknown to him has made a miscalculation or other mistake, some high-minded men might
consider it appropriate that he should agree to a fresh bargain to cure the miscalculation or mistake,
abandoning his good fortune. But if equity were to enforce the views of those high-minded men, we have no
doubt that it would run counter to the attitudes of much the greater part of ordinary mankind (not least the
world of commerce), and would be venturing upon the field of moral philosophy in which it would soon be in
difficulties.
However, a claimant who can establish that the other party knew of his mistake or
sought to take advantage of it may be entitled to rectification (
A Roberts & Co Ltd
 
v.
Leicestershire County Council
 
[1961] Ch 555). In 
Commissioner for the New Towns
 
v.
Cooper (Great Britain) Ltd
 
[1995] Ch 259, Stuart-Smith LJ stated (at pp. 277–280):
The commonest circumstance in which rectification is granted is where the written contract does not accurately
record the parties’ joint agreement. In other words, there is a mistake common to both parties. In the case of
unilateral mistake, that is to say where only one party is mistaken as to the meaning of the contract, rectification
is not ordinarily appropriate. This follows from the ordinary rule that it is the objective intention of the parties
which determines the construction of the contract and not the subjective intention of one of them. Also, it would
generally be inequitable to compel the other party to execute a contract, which he had no intention of making,
(1)
(2)
simply to accord with the mistaken interpretation of the other party. … But the court will intervene if there are
‘additional circumstances that render unconscionable reliance on the document by the party who has intended
that it should have effect according to its terms’. The debate in this case turns on what amounts to
unconscionable conduct. … It was common ground in this court that fraud, in the form of a dishonest
misrepresentation, will also amount to unconscionable behaviour. … I would hold that where A intends B to be
mistaken as to the construction of the agreement, so conducts himself that he diverts B’s attention from
discovering the mistake by making false and misleading statements, and B in fact makes the very mistake that A
intends, then notwithstanding that A does not actually know, but merely suspects, that B is mistaken, and it
cannot be shown that the mistake was induced by any misrepresentation, rectification may be granted. A’s
conduct is unconscionable and he cannot insist on performance in accordance to the strict letter of the contract;
that is sufficient for rescission. But it may also not be unjust or inequitable to insist that the contract be
performed according to B’s understanding, where that was the meaning that A intended B should put upon it.
Where the parties are involved in arm’s length negotiations, it is no easy task to
persuade a court that there has been ‘unconscionable conduct’. As Sedley LJ observed in
George Wimpey UK Ltd
 
v. 
VI Components Ltd
 
[2005] EWCA Civ 77, [2005] BLR 135,
there is something of ‘a paradox in the notion of what an honourable and reasonable
person would do in the context of an arm’s-length commercial negotiation’. While an
‘honourable’ person would probably draw the attention of the other party to the mistake
that it has made, the ‘reasonable’ person might not do so on the ground that his primary
concern is to protect his own interests or the interests of his principal. Thus the terms
‘honesty and reasonableness’ are no more than ‘a judicial attempt to sketch a line
beyond which conduct may be regarded as unconscionable or inequitable’. But ‘sharp
practice’ has ‘no defined boundary’ and, in deciding whether or not there has been such
sharp practice, the court may have regard to the resources available to the contracting
parties. In other words, arm’s length negotiations between ‘parties of unequal
competence and resources may well place greater constraints of honest and reasonable
conduct on the stronger party than on the weaker’.
The final difficulty, and the issue that has proved to be most controversial in recent
years, relates to those rectification cases where it is said that the document does not
reflect the agreement that the parties have made; that is to say where the document fails
to reflect the common intention of the parties. At a high level, the factors to be taken
into account by the courts in such cases are the subject of general agreement and were
set out by Peter Gibson LJ in 
Swainland Builders Ltd
 
v. 
Freehold Properties Ltd
 
[2002]
2 EGLR 71, 74 in the following terms:
the parties had a common continuing intention, whether or not amounting to an agreement, in respect
of a particular matter in the instrument to be rectified;
there was an outward expression of accord;
(3)
(4)
the intention continued at the time of the execution of the instrument sought to be rectified;
by mistake, the instrument did not reflect that common intention.
However, the particular issue which has given rise to considerable controversy is
whether the test to be applied when seeking to identify the parties’ continuing common
intention is an objective one or a subjective one. This controversy and the issues
surrounding it were recently examined by the Court of Appeal in the following case.
FSHC GROUP HOLDINGS LTD V. GLAS TRUST
CORPORATION LTD
[2019] EWCA Civ 1361, [2020] Ch 365, Court of Appeal
Leggatt LJ
6. Rectification is an equitable remedy by which the court may amend the terms of
a legal document which, because of a mistake, fails accurately to reflect the
intention of the parties to it. As we will discuss, for many years and indeed
centuries it was understood that the intention which the court is concerned to
identify in deciding whether to grant this remedy is the actual intention of the
relevant party or parties as a matter of psychological fact. Recently, however, a
different approach has been proposed where the document is a written contract.
7.
 
In 
Chartbrook Ltd
 
v. 
Persimmon Homes Ltd
 
[2009] UKHL 38; [2009] AC
1101, Lord Hoffmann (in a judgment with which all the other members of the
appellate committee of the House of Lords agreed) expressed the view that, where
the document of which rectification is sought is a written contract, the relevant test
of intention is purely ‘objective’—meaning by this what a reasonable observer with
knowledge of the background facts and prior communications between the parties
would have thought their common intention at the time of contracting to be.
8.
 
The observations about rectification made in the 
Chartbrook
 
case were
recognised by the House of Lords itself to be 
obiter dicta
, which therefore did not
create a binding precedent …
9.
 
In the decade since Lord Hoffmann’s observations were made, they have
proved controversial and have been criticised by both academic commentators
and judges …
10.
 
Uncertainty and dissatisfaction about the present state of the law has
grown … On this appeal the question of which test of common intention is correct
has been put in issue … and we think it necessary to confront it …
46.
 
At a general level, the principle of rectification based on a common mistake
is clear. It is necessary to show that at the time of executing the written contract
the parties had a common intention (even if not amounting to a binding agreement)
which, as a result of mistake on the part of both parties, the document failed
accurately to record. This requires convincing proof to displace the natural
presumption that the written contract is an accurate record of what the parties
agreed …
51.
 
The jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery to correct mistakes in written
instruments by rectification can be tracked back to its roots in canon and Roman
law …
52.
 
There can be no doubt that where, in these and other cases in which
rectification was claimed, judges referred to the ‘intention’ of the parties, they were
referring to what the parties actually intended. Indeed, the use of the term
‘intention’ to refer to what an ‘objective’ observer would reasonably have
understood the parties’ intention to be from their communications (irrespective of
their actual states of mind) is, we believe, a comparatively recent legal artefact …
[The Court of Appeal then engaged in a detailed analysis of the historical
development of rectification, including an analysis of Lord Hoffmann’s judgment in
Chartbrook
 
and his articulation of an objective test of intention, and concluded]
141.
 
… We agree with the reasoning … that, if parties make a binding
agreement to execute a document containing particular terms but instead execute
a document containing different terms, the court may specifically enforce the
agreement by rectifying the document; and that, in such a case, the terms of the
contract to which the subsequent document is made to conform must be
objectively determined in the same way as any other contract.
142.
 
We do not, however, accept that the same reasoning can be applied to a
situation in which parties have not made any prior contract but had a common
continuing intention in respect of a particular matter in the document sought to be
rectified. Where, as we see it, the analysis in the 
Chartbrook
 
case went awry was
in regarding rectification to reflect a common intention where there was no prior
contract as also based on the principle that agreements must be kept. As we have
seen, that was not historically the principle on which equity interfered with written
contracts which mistakenly failed to reflect the common intention of the parties; nor
in our view does it provide a proper basis for such interference. Rather, rectification
to give effect to a ‘common continuing intention’ not amounting to a legally
enforceable contract is justified, and is only capable of being justified, as an
instance of the second form of rectification, based on an equitable principle of
good faith …
146.
 
The justification for rectifying a contractual document to conform to a
‘continuing common intention’ is therefore not to be found in the principle that
agreements (as objectively determined) must be kept. It lies elsewhere. It rests on
the equitable doctrine that a party will not be allowed to enforce the terms of a
written contract, objectively ascertained, when to do so is against conscience
because it is inconsistent with what both parties in fact intended (and mutually
understood each other to intend) those terms to be when the document was
executed. This basis for rectification is entirely concerned with the parties’
subjective states of mind. The underlying moral principle can be characterised, to
adopt Lord Hoffmann’s analysis, as being that persons who make a contract have
to observe certain standards of good faith.
147.
 
It is not, however, a new principle … Nor is it limited … to cases of
unilateral mistake. We have seen that the principle is of ancient origin and was,
historically, the rationale for granting rectification in cases of common mistake.
Moreover, it is just as contrary to good faith—if not more obviously so—for a party
to take advantage of a mistake about the content or effect of a written contract in a
case where both parties were mistaken in believing when the contract was
executed that it faithfully recorded their common intention than it is to do so in a
case where only one party made such a mistake (to the other’s knowledge).
Rectification for unilateral mistake can … be understood as an extension of the
same basic equitable principle. It is fundamental to the doctrine, in either aspect,
that an actual mistake was made by one or more real people in believing that the
written contract gave effect to what either was or was understood by one party to
be the parties’ actual common intention …
176.
 
For all these reasons, we are unable to accept that the objective test of
rectification for common mistake articulated in Lord Hoffmann’s 
obiter
 
remarks in
the 
Chartbrook
 
case correctly states the law. We consider that we are bound by
authority, which also accords with sound legal principle and policy, to hold that,
before a written contract may be rectified on the basis of a common mistake, it is
necessary to show either (1) that the document fails to give effect to a prior
concluded contract or (2) that, when they executed the document, the parties had
a common intention in respect of a particular matter which, by mistake, the
document did not accurately record. In the latter case it is necessary to show not
only that each party to the contract had the same actual intention with regard to the
relevant matter, but also that there was an ‘outward expression of accord’—
meaning that, as a result of communication between them, the parties understood
each other to share that intention.
Commentary
It is unlikely that the decision of the Court of Appeal will be the last word on the issue,
not least because of its departure from the opinion expressed by Lord Hoffmann in the
House of Lords after ‘full’ argument: see 
Chartbrook
 
at [58] (for further analysis of the
case and the issues which it raises see Stevens (2020) 136 
LQR
 
599, Beale and Beale
[2020] 
LMCLQ
 
1, and Peel (2020) 136 
LQR
 
205). The distinction drawn by the Court of
Appeal is between the case where the prior agreement between the parties takes the
form of a binding contract (where the usual objective test is applicable to that prior
contract) and the case where the agreement takes the form of a common understanding
which is not legally binding (where the court is concerned with the subjective intention
of the parties). In the view of the Court of Appeal the two cases respond to different
principles. In the first category the underlying principle is that agreements must be kept
but in the second the principle is that it is against conscience to enforce a contract when
to do so is inconsistent with what both parties subjectively intended.
The distinction thus drawn by the Court of Appeal may be open to question. It does not
appear to fit with powerful dicta in earlier cases. An example is to be found in the
judgment of Denning LJ in 
Frederick E Rose (London) Ltd
 
v. 
William H Pim Jnr & Co
Ltd
 
[1953] 2 QB 450, 461, where he stated that:
[r]ectification is concerned with contracts and documents, not with intentions. In order to get rectification it is
necessary to show that the parties were in complete agreement on the terms of their contract, but by an error
wrote them down wrongly; and in this regard, in order to ascertain the terms of their contract, you do not look
into the inner minds of the parties—into their intentions—any more than you do in the formation of any other
contract. You look at their outward acts, that is, at what they said or wrote to one another in coming to their
agreement, and then compare it with the document which they have signed. If you can predicate with certainty
what their contract was, and that it is, by a common mistake, wrongly expressed in the document, then you
rectify the document; but nothing less will suffice.
This statement appears to provide unequivocal support for an objective test of intention
but it can be explained consistently with the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
FSHC
Group Holdings
 
on the ground that Lord Denning was there concerned with the
question of whether or not there had been a prior contract between the parties, and so
the test applied was, quite properly, an objective one. It was not until the later decision
of the Court of Appeal in 
Joscelyne
 
v. 
Nissen
 
[1970] 2 QB 86 that it was clearly
established that a prior concluded contract was not necessary for rectification and that a
common intention continuing at the time when a contract is made is sufficient, provided
that there has been an ‘outward expression of accord’. And it is in this latter context that
the subjective test of intention is applicable. It should also be noted that in the latter
group of cases evidence of the subjective intention of the parties must be combined with
an outward expression of accord. The Court of Appeal in 
FSHC Group Holdings
 
justified
the latter requirement in the following terms:
77. … the power of the court to rectify a contractual document is not a power to make an agreement for the
parties; it is a power to correct mistakes in recording what the parties have actually agreed. Moreover, the effect
of rectification is not merely to prevent a party from enforcing the written terms of a contract: it is to alter those
terms so as to establish legal rights and obligations which differ from those recorded in the original contractual
document. 
Leaving aside for the time being cases of rectification for unilateral mistake, establishing new
contractual rights and obligations in this way is only justified if they are founded on mutual agreement.
Whether the test applied is subjective or objective, it is fundamental that contractual rights and obligations
should be based on mutual assent which the parties have manifested to each other and not on uncommunicated
intentions which happen, without the parties knowing it, to coincide. Thus, as noted in 
Tartsinis
 
v. 
Navona
Management Co
 
[2015] EWHC 57 (Comm), para 88, it would be capricious if a document which the parties
have agreed as the formal record of their contract could be altered to make it conform to the private intention of
a party just because, although unknown to that party at the time, it turns out that the other party had a similar
intention. We agree with the answer implied to the following question posed by Campbell JA in the Australian
case of 
Ryledar Pty Ltd
 
v. 
Euphoric Pty Ltd
 
[2007] NSWCA 65; [2007] NSWLR 603 at para 315:
‘If two negotiating parties each had a particular intention about the agreement they would enter, and their
intentions were identical, but that intention was disclosed by neither of them, and they later entered
[into] a document that did not accord with that intention, what would be the injustice or
unconscientiousness in either of them enforcing the document according to its terms?’

Non Est Factum
Non est factum
 
is a defence which can be invoked by someone who does not understand
a document that he has signed. However, the defence operates within narrow limits,
largely to protect the interests of third parties who may rely to their detriment on the
validity of a signature contained in a document. A claimant who wishes to invoke the
defence must establish two points. First, he must establish that he was permanently or
temporarily unable through no fault of his own to have without explanation any real
understanding of the document he has signed. Secondly, he must show that there was a
real or substantial difference between the document which he signed and the document
which he believed he was signing. However, a claimant will not be able to invoke the
defence when he has been careless in signing the document or has simply failed to read
the document properly (
United Dominions Trust Ltd
 
v. 
Western
 
[1976] QB 513). In such
a case the party signing the document is bound by his signature (see 
9.2
). The leading
case on 
non est factum
 
is the following decision of the House of Lords:
SAUNDERS (EXECUTRIX OF THE WILL OF ROSE MAUD
GALLIE, DEC’D) V. ANGLIA BUILDING SOCIETY
[1971] AC 1004, House of Lords
Mrs Gallie was a 78-year-old widow. She had a leasehold interest in a house. She
intended to make a gift of her interest to her nephew, Mr Parkin. She gave him the
deeds knowing that he wished to raise money on the house in collaboration with
his business associate, Mr Lee. In June 1962 Mr Lee asked Mrs Gallie to sign a
document. As Mrs Gallie had broken her glasses and could not read the document,
she asked Mr Lee to tell her what it was. He told her that it was a deed of gift of the
house to her nephew. Mrs Gallie signed the document in that belief and her
nephew witnessed her signature. In fact, the document was an assignment of her
interest to Mr Lee for £3,000. Mr Lee never paid the £3,000 and had never
intended to pay it. He 
mortgaged the house for £2,000 with the Anglia Building
Society, used the money raised to pay his debts, and subsequently defaulted on
the mortgage repayments. Anglia sought possession of the house. Mrs Gallie
brought an action against Mr Lee and Anglia seeking a declaration that the
assignment was void on the ground of 
non est factum
. The judge held that the plea
of 
non est factum
 
was made out and granted the declaration. The Court of Appeal
reversed the decision. The House of Lords held that the plea of 
non est factum
 
had
not been established.
Lord Reid
The plea of 
non est factum
 
obviously applies when the person sought to be held
liable did not in fact sign the document. But at least since the sixteenth century it
has also been held to apply in certain cases so as to enable a person who in fact
signed a document to say that it is not his deed. Obviously any such extension
must be kept within narrow limits if it is not to shake the confidence of those who
habitually and rightly rely on signatures when there is no obvious reason to doubt
their validity. Originally this extension appears to have been made in favour of
those who were unable to read owing to blindness or illiteracy and who therefore
had to trust someone to tell them what they were signing. I think it must also apply
in favour of those who are permanently or temporarily unable through no fault of
their own to have without explanation any real understanding of the purport of a
particular document, whether that be from defective education, illness or innate
incapacity.
But that does not excuse them from taking such precautions as they
reasonably can. The matter generally arises where an innocent third party has
relied on a signed document in ignorance of the circumstances in which it was
signed, and where he will suffer loss if the maker of the document is allowed to
have it declared a nullity. So there must be a heavy burden of proof on the person
who seeks to invoke this remedy. He must prove all the circumstances necessary
to justify its being granted to him, and that necessarily involves his proving that he
took all reasonable precautions in the circumstances. I do not say that the remedy
can never be available to a man of full capacity. But that could only be in very
exceptional circumstances: certainly not where his reason for not scrutinising the
document before signing it was that he was too busy or too lazy. In general I do not
think he can be heard to say that he signed in reliance on someone he trusted.
But, particularly when he was led to believe that the document which he signed
was not one which affected his legal rights, there may be cases where this plea
can properly be applied in favour of a man of full capacity.
The plea cannot be available to anyone who was content to sign without taking
the trouble to try to find out at least the general effect of the document. Many
people do frequently sign documents put before them for signature by their solicitor
or other trusted advisers without making any inquiry as to their purpose or effect.
But the essence of the plea 
non est factum
 
is that the person signing believed that
the document he signed had one character or one effect whereas in fact its
character or effect was quite different. He could not have such a belief unless he
had taken steps or been given information which gave him some grounds for his
belief. The amount of information he must have and the sufficiency of the
particularity of his belief must depend on the circumstances of each case.
Further, the plea cannot be available to a person whose mistake was really a
mistake as to the legal effect of the document, whether that was his own mistake
or that of his adviser. That has always been the law and in this branch of the law at
least I see no reason for any change.
We find in many of the authorities statements that a man’s deed is not his deed
if his mind does not go with his pen. But that is far too wide. It would cover cases
where the man had taken no precautions at all, and there was no ground for his
belief that he was signing something different from that which in fact he signed. I
think that it is the wrong approach to start from that wide statement and then
whittle it down by excluding cases where the remedy will not be granted. It is for
the person who seeks the remedy to show that he should have it.
Finally, there is the question as to what extent or in what way must there be a
difference between that which in fact he signed and that which he believed he was
signing. In an endeavour to keep the plea within bounds there have been many
attempts to lay down a dividing line. But any dividing line suggested has been
difficult to apply in practice and has sometimes led to unreasonable results. In
particular I do not think that the modern division between the character and the
contents of a document is at all satisfactory. Some of the older authorities suggest
a more flexible test so that one can take all factors into consideration. There was a
period when here, as elsewhere in the law, hard-and-fast dividing lines were
sought, but I think that experience has shown that often they do not produce
certainty but do produce unreasonable results.
I think that in the older authorities difference in practical result was more
important than difference in legal character. If a man thinks he is signing a
document which will cost him £10 and the actual document would cost him £1,000
it could not be right to deny him this remedy simply because the legal character of
the two was the same. It is true that we must then deal with questions of degree,
but that is a familiar task for the courts and I would not expect it to give rise to a
flood of litigation.
There must, I think, be a radical difference between what he signed and what
he thought he was signing—or one could use the words ‘fundamental’ or ‘serious’
or ‘very substantial’. But what amounts to a radical difference will depend on all the
circumstances. If he thinks he is giving property to A whereas the document gives
it to B, the difference may often be of vital importance, but in the circumstances of
the present case I do not think that it is. I think that it must be left to the courts to
determine in each case in light of all the facts whether there was or was not a
sufficiently great difference. The plea 
non est factum
 
is in a sense illogical when
applied to a case where the man in fact signed the deed. But it is none the worse
for that if applied in a reasonable way.
I would dismiss this appeal.
Lord Wilberforce
The plea of 
non est factum
 
has a long history. In medieval times, when contracts
were made by deeds, and the deed had a kind of life in the law of its own, illiterate
people who either could not read, or could not understand, the language in which
the deed was written, were allowed this plea (that is what ‘
non est factum
’ is—a
plea): the result of it, if successful, was that the deed was not their deed. I think
that three things can be said about the early law. First, that no definition was given
of the nature or extent of the difference which must exist between what was
intended and what was done—whether such as later appeared as the distinction
between ‘character’ and ‘contents’ or otherwise. … Secondly, the … cases are for
the most part as between the original parties to the deed, or if a third party is
concerned … he is a successor to the estate granted. Thirdly, there is some
indication that the plea was not available where the signer had been guilty of a lack
of care in signing what he did: there is no great precision in the definitions of the
disabling conduct …
In the nineteenth century, the emphasis had shifted towards the consensual
contract, and the courts, probably unconscious of the fact, had a choice. They
could either have discarded the whole doctrine on which 
non est factum
 
was
based, as obsolete, or they could try to adapt it to the prevailing structure of
contract. … They chose the course of adaptation, and, as in many other fields of
the law, this process of adaptation has not been logical, or led to a logical result.
The modern version still contains some fossilised elements.
We had traced, in arguments at the Bar, the emergence of the distinction, which
has come to be made between a difference (of intention from result) of character,
which may render a document void, and a difference of contents which at most
makes it voidable. … It was really the language used in the second leading case of
Howatson
 
v. 
Webb
 
[1907] 1 Ch 537 which has given rise to difficulty. There, in a
judgment of Warrington J which has carried 
much conviction and authority, we find
that, although the judgment of Byles J in 
Foster
 
v. 
Mackinnon
 
(1869) LR 4 CP 704
is quoted, the use of the word ‘contents’ is switched to mean what the deed
actually (as a matter of detail) contains, and contrasted with what is called its legal
character (see p. 549: ‘The misrepresentation was as to the contents of the deed,
and not as to the character and class of the deed’).
The distinction, as restated, is terminologically confusing and in substance
illogical, as the judgments in the Court of Appeal demonstrate. On the one hand, it
cannot be right that a document should be void through a mistake as to the label it
bears, however little this mistake may be fundamental to what the signer intends:
on the other hand, it is not satisfactory that the document should be valid if the
mistake is merely as to what the document contains, however radical this mistake
may be and however cataclysmic its result.
The existing test, or at least its terminology, may be criticised, but does it follow
that there are no definable circumstances in which a document to which a man has
put his signature may be held to be not his document, and so void rather than
merely voidable? The judgment of the learned Master of the Rolls seems at first
sight to suggest that there are not and that the whole doctrine ought to be
discarded, but a closer reading shows that he is really confining his observations to
the plainest, and no doubt commonest, cases where a man of full understanding
and capacity forbears, or negligently omits, to read what he has signed. That, in
the present age, such a person should be denied the 
non est factum
 
plea I would
accept. … But there remains a residue of difficult cases. There are still illiterate or
senile persons who cannot read, or apprehend, a legal document; there are still
persons who may be tricked into putting their signature on a piece of paper which
has legal consequences totally different from anything they intended. Certainly the
first class may in some cases, even without the plea, be able to obtain relief, either
because no third party has become involved, or, if he has, with the assistance of
equitable doctrines, because the third party’s interest is equitable only and his
conduct such that his rights should be postponed. … Certainly, too, the second
class may in some cases fall under the heading of plain forgery, in which event the
plea of 
non est factum
 
is not needed, or indeed available … and in others be
reduced if the signer is denied the benefit of the plea because of his negligence.
But accepting all that has been said by learned judges as to the necessity of
confining the plea within narrow limits, to eliminate it altogether would, in my
opinion, deprive the courts of what may be, doubtless on sufficiently rare
occasions, an instrument of justice.
How, then, ought the principle, on which a plea of 
non est factum
 
is admissible,
to be stated? In my opinion, a document should be held to be void (as opposed to
voidable) only when the element of consent to it is totally lacking, that is, more
concretely, when the transaction which the document purports to effect is
essentially different in substance or in kind from the transaction intended. Many
other expressions, or adjectives, could be used—‘basically’ or ‘radically’ or
‘fundamentally’ …
To this general test it is necessary to add certain amplifications. First, there is
the case of fraud. The law as to this is best stated in the words of the judgment in
Foster
 
v. 
Mackinnon
 
(1869) LR 4 CP 704, 711 where it is said that a signature
obtained by fraud:
‘is invalid not merely on the ground of fraud, where fraud exists, but on the
ground that the mind of the signer did not accompany the signature; in other
words, that he never intended to sign, and therefore in contemplation of law never
did sign, the contract to which his name is appended.’
In other words, it is the lack of consent that matters, not the means by which
this result was brought about. Fraud by itself may do no more than make the
contract voidable.
Secondly, a man cannot escape from the consequences, as regards innocent
third parties, of signing a document if, being a man of ordinary education and
competence, he chooses to sign it without informing himself of its purport and
effect …
Thirdly, there is the case where the signer has been careless in not taking
ordinary precautions against being deceived. This is a difficult area. … In my
opinion, the correct rule, and 
that which in fact prevailed until 
Bragg
’s case
[
Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Company
 
v. 
Bragg
 
[1911] 1 KB 489], is that,
leaving aside negotiable instruments to which special rules may apply, a person
who signs a document, and parts with it so that it may come into other hands, has
a responsibility, that of the normal man of prudence, to take care what he signs,
which, if neglected, prevents him from denying his liability under the document
according to its tenor. I would add that the onus of proof in this matter rests upon
him, i.e. to prove that he acted carefully, and not upon the third party to prove the
contrary….
The preceding paragraphs contemplate persons who are adult and literate: the
conclusion as to such persons is that, while there are cases in which they may
successfully plead 
non est factum
 
these cases will, in modern times, be rare.
As to persons who are illiterate, or blind, or lacking in understanding, the law is
in a dilemma. On the one hand, the law is traditionally, and rightly, ready to relieve
them against hardship and imposition. On the other hand, regard has to be paid to
the position of innocent third parties who cannot be expected, and often would
have no means, to know the condition or status of the signer. I do not think that a
defined solution can be provided for all cases. The law ought, in my opinion, to
give relief if satisfied that consent was truly lacking but will require of signers even
in this class that they act responsibly and carefully according to their
circumstances in putting their signature to legal documents.
This brings me to the present case. Mrs Gallie was a lady of advanced age,
but, as her evidence shows, by no means incapable physically or mentally. It
certainly cannot be said that she did not receive sympathetic consideration or the
benefit of much doubt from the judge as to the circumstances in which the
assignment was executed. But accepting all of this, I am satisfied, with Russell LJ,
that she fell short, very far short, of making the clear and satisfactory case which is
required of those who seek to have a legal act declared void and of establishing a
sufficient discrepancy between her intentions and her act …
I would dismiss the appeal.
Lord Pearson
In my opinion, the plea of 
non est factum
 
ought to be available in a proper case for
the relief of a person who for permanent or temporary reasons (not limited to
blindness or illiteracy) is not capable of both reading and sufficiently understanding
the deed or other document to be signed. By ‘sufficiently understanding’ I mean
understanding at least to the point of detecting a fundamental difference between
the actual document and the document as the signer had believed it to be. There
must be a proper case for such relief. There would not be a proper case if (a) the
signature of the document was brought about by negligence of the signer in failing
to take precautions which he ought to have taken, or (b) the actual document was
not fundamentally different from the document as the signer believed it to be. …
The principle as stated is limited to a case in which it is apparent on the face of
the document that it is intended to have legal consequences. … I wish to reserve
the question whether the plea of 
non est factum
 
would ever be rightly successful in
a case where (1) it is apparent on the face of the document that it is intended to
have legal consequences; (2) the signer of the document is able to read and
sufficiently understand the document; (3) the document is fundamentally different
from what he supposes it to be; (4) he is induced to sign it without reading it. It
seems unlikely that the plea ought ever to succeed in such a case, but it is
inadvisable to rule out the wholly exceptional and unpredictable case.
Lord Hodson
 
and 
Viscount Dilhorne
 
delivered concurring speeches.
Commentary
The facts of the case demonstrate the conflicting interests at stake. On the one hand we
have the desire to protect Mrs Gallie from being taken advantage of by her nephew and
his associate, while on the other hand we can see the need to protect the building society
who, as a third party, advanced money on the validity of Mrs Gallie’s signature. The
defence of 
non est factum
 
is drawn by the House of Lords in narrow terms, with a view
to protecting third parties, but, at the same time, there is an attempt to avoid creating
arbitrary distinctions both in terms of the persons entitled to invoke the defence and in
relation to the nature of the mistake that must be established in order to entitle a party
to rely on the defence. The category of parties able to invoke the defence is not confined
to the blind or the illiterate. It encompasses a much broader range of people but at the
same time it does not extend to adults of full capacity who do not take the time to
protect their own interests by reading the document they have signed. In relation to the
type of mistake that entitles a party to invoke the defence, the House of Lords rejects the
technical approach taken in 
Howatson
 
v. 
Webb
 
[1907] 1 Ch 537 (see the speech of Lord
Wilberforce extracted earlier) and adopts a broader approach which simply requires that
the difference between the document as it was and as it was believed to be must be
radical or substantial or fundamental.

Misrepresentation
Central Issues
The law of misrepresentation is, in many ways, the law of induced
mistake: that is to say one party is induced to enter into a contract as
a result of a false statement of fact made to him by the defendant or by
a third party. The ground on which the relief is sought in these cases
does not rest on the mistake made by the claimant but rather rests on
the fact that the mistake was induced by the false statement of fact
that was made to the claimant and which induced him to enter into the
contract.
A claimant who wishes to seek relief on the ground of
misrepresentation must, first of all, establish that a misrepresentation
was made to him. A misrepresentation is an unambiguous false
statement of fact, made to the claimant, which induced him to enter
into a contract. This definition has given rise to a number of difficulties
in the case-law. Can a statement of opinion or a statement of intention
constitute a misrepresentation? Can a misrepresentation be made by
conduct? Must a misrepresentation be ‘material’? When will a
misrepresentation be held to have induced a claimant to enter into a
contract? All of these questions will be explored in this chapter.
English law does not generally recognize the existence of a duty of
disclosure. However, in certain circumstances, a failure to disclose
information may give rise to a claim for misrepresentation. These
circumstances will be examined in this chapter.
A claimant who has been induced to enter into a contract by a
misrepresentation made to him by the other party to the contract is, in
principle, entitled to set aside (or ‘rescind’) that contract. Rescission is
an extremely powerful remedy because it sets aside a contract for all
purposes. There are, however, a number of ‘bars’ to rescission and the
5.
6.
scope of these bars will be examined in this chapter. Rescission for
misrepresentation must be distinguished from the termination of a
contract for breach. Rescission for misrepresentation aims to unwind
the contract so that it is set aside both retrospectively and
prospectively. Termination for breach, by contrast, discharges the
contract prospectively but not retrospectively.
Damages are also available as a remedy for misrepresentation. Prior
to 1963 only a fraudulent misrepresentation gave rise to a claim for
damages (in the tort of deceit). The right to claim damages for
misrepresentation was extended by the House of Lords in 1963 when it
was recognized that, in certain circumstances, a negligent
misrepresentation could give rise to a claim for damages in tort. The
final step was taken in 1967 when section 2 of the Misrepresentation
Act 1967 created a statutory right to recover damages in respect of
negligent misrepresentations and in respect of some innocent
misrepresentations. Section 2 is now the most important source of the
right to recover damages for misrepresentation. Section 2 has proved
to be a controversial provision and the controversies associated with
it will be examined in this chapter.
Attempts to exclude or restrict liability for misrepresentation are
regulated by section 3 of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 which
subjects such clauses to a test of reasonableness. The question
whether an entire agreement clause falls within the scope of section 3
has proved to be a contentious issue and will be examined at the end
of the chapter.
17.1
 
Introduction
The law of misrepresentation inhabits a borderland between contract, tort, and
restitution (or unjust enrichment). A misrepresentation induces a party to enter into a
contract but is often not part of the contract itself; a fraudulent or negligent
misrepresentation can give rise to a claim for damages in tort; and a personal and
(possibly) a proprietary restitutionary claim can be brought to recover the value of
benefits conferred under a contract which has been set aside (or ‘rescinded’) for
misrepresentation. The role of the law of tort and the law of restitution will be examined
when discussing the remedial consequences of a misrepresentation. A further possible
source of redress open to a consumer is to be found under the Consumer Protection
from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/1277) as amended by the Consumer
Protection (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (SI 2014/870). The giving of false
information to a consumer may amount to an unfair commercial practice entitling the
consumer to unwind the contract, to obtain a discount, or to recover damages. These
rights are additional to those given to consumers by the common law (including equity)
but cannot be exercised in combination with such rights. These statutory rights will not
be discussed in any detail in this book.
The proposition that a misrepresentation induces a party to enter into a contract but is
often not part of the contract itself requires further elaboration. Not every statement
made prior to entry into a contract is incorporated into the contract as a term. It can in
fact be a difficult task to determine in any given case whether a pre-contractual
statement is simply a representation which has induced entry into the contract but is not
part of the contract or whether it is in fact a term of the contract. The tests applied by
the courts to distinguish between a term and a representation have been examined
already (see 
8.3
) and it is not necessary to go over the same ground again. Here, it
suffices to state that the distinction between a term and a representation does have
remedial consequences. Where the 
statement is a term of the contract, a failure to
comply with it, without lawful excuse, will constitute a breach of contract, and the
remedies available will be those available in a breach of contract claim (on which see
Chapters 22–24
). On the other hand, where the representation is not a term of the
contract then the claimant’s claim will be one for misrepresentation and not for breach
of contract. The remedies for misrepresentation will be discussed in this chapter.
It is, of course, possible for a pre-contractual statement to be incorporated into the
contract as a term. In such a case the claimant will have an action for breach of contract
in the event of a breach of the term and the usual remedies for breach will be available to
him. But it may also be possible for a claimant in such a case to bring a claim for
misrepresentation and seek rescission of the contract or damages. Section 1(a) of the
Misrepresentation Act 1967 provides that a party who has entered into a contract after a
misrepresentation has been made to him may rescind the contract for
misrepresentation, even in the case where the misrepresentation is subsequently
incorporated into the contract as a term, provided that he is entitled to rescind the
contract without alleging fraud. The scope of this subsection is, in some respects,
unclear but its general effect is to make provision for the survival of the right to rescind
for misrepresentation in the case where a statement of fact has been incorporated into a
contract as a term, but at the same time the subsection does not purport to take away
any remedies available to the claimant for breach of contract (
Salt
 
v. 
Stratstone
Specialist Ltd
 
[2015] EWCA Civ 745, [2015] 2 CLC 269). This being the case, the
claimant would appear to have available to him the usual array of remedies for breach of
contract but also has the possibility of rescinding the contract for misrepresentation
where he can establish an entitlement to do so.
The remainder of this chapter is devoted solely to liability for misrepresentation and
does not deal with the complications that can arise where the statement has also been
incorporated into the contract as a term. The remainder of the chapter is divided into
five sections. The next section (
17.2
) examines the definition of a misrepresentation; 
17.3
deals with the extent to which English law recognizes the existence of a duty of
disclosure; the subject matter of 
17.4
 
is rescission; 
17.5
 
explores the extent to which a
misrepresentation can give rise to a claim for damages; and 
17.6
 
examines the extent to
which it is possible to exclude liability for misrepresentation.
17.2
 
What Is a Misrepresentation?
A misrepresentation can be defined as an unambiguous false statement of fact which is
addressed to the party misled and which induces that party to enter into a contract.
There may be further elements to the definition. One issue of controversy has been
whether or not the misrepresentation must also be ‘material’. The definition of a
misrepresentation has proved to be surprisingly troublesome and it has given rise to a
considerable amount of litigation. It is therefore necessary to examine the constituent
elements of a misrepresentation in greater detail before using some cases to illustrate
the difficulties that have arisen.
First, the misrepresentation must have been ‘unambiguous’. An ambiguous statement
will not generally give rise to a right of action for misrepresentation except in the case
where a party makes an ambiguous statement intending it to convey a meaning which he
knows is not true and the party to whom the statement is made reasonably understands
it in the sense which is not true.
Secondly, the representation must have been ‘false’. A statement which is true obviously
cannot give rise to a claim for misrepresentation.
Thirdly, there must have been a ‘statement’. The requirement that the misrepresentation
take the form of a ‘statement’ draws attention to the fact that there must be some
positive conduct on the part of the representor. A mere failure to disclose information
will not, as a general rule, give rise to an action for misrepresentation (see 
17.3
). The
statement commonly takes the form of a written or an oral communication. But it need
not do so. A representation can be made by conduct. Cases involving representations by
conduct can give rise to acute difficulties in terms of identifying the meaning that was
conveyed by the conduct.
Fourthly, the statement must generally be one ‘of fact’. There are a number of issues
here. First, this requirement serves to distinguish a representation from a promise. A
promise is more than a statement of fact. It is an undertaking to do something or not to
do something. A representation, by contrast, simply asserts the existence of a given state
of affairs which is either true or false. The statement invites reliance upon it but it does
not constitute an undertaking to bring about that state of affairs. Secondly, it has proved
to be difficult to distinguish a statement of fact from other types of statement that can be
made, such as a statement of law, of opinion, or of intention. The distinction between
these different types of statement is not as rigid as it once was because it is now clear
that statements of law, opinion, and intention can, in certain circumstances, give rise to
a claim for misrepresentation. Thus it is now established that a mistake of law can, in an
appropriate case, entitle the mistaken party to set aside a contract entered into as a
result of the mistake (
Brennan
 
v. 
Bolt Burden (a firm)
 
[2004] EWCA Civ 1017, [2005]
QB 303) and that a misrepresentation of law can found a cause of action (
Pankhania
 
v.
London Borough of Hackney
 
[2002] EWHC 2441 (Ch)). Statements of opinion are more
difficult. While authority can be found to support the proposition that a statement of
opinion does not suffice to give a claim for misrepresentation (
Bisset
 
v. 
Wilkinson
 
[1927]
AC 177, see 
17.2.1
), more recent authority has held statements of opinion to be
actionable where the person who makes the statement of opinion has some special skill
but fails to exercise it (see 
Esso Petroleum Ltd
 
v. 
Mardon
 
[1976] QB 801, 
8.3.1
). A
statement of intention, on the other hand, cannot generally constitute a
misrepresentation unless the person making the statement mis-states his present
intention (see 
Edgington
 
v. 
Fitzmaurice
 
(1885) 29 Ch D 459, 
17.2.2
).
Fifthly, the statement must have been ‘addressed to the party misled’. This can be done
in one of two ways. First, it can be made directly as in the case where one party speaks to
another or writes to him. Secondly, it can be done indirectly. A statement can be
addressed to a person ‘indirectly’ when the statement is made by the maker of the
statement to a third party with the intention that the third party pass on the information
to the claimant. An example is information conveyed by one bank to another with the
intention that the recipient bank convey the information to one of its customers (see, for
example, 
Commercial Banking of Sydney
 
v. 
R.H. Brown and Co
 
[1972] 2 Lloyd’s Rep
360).
Sixthly, there is a debate as to whether or not the misrepresentation must have been
‘material’. The judgments in 
Bisset
 
v. 
Wilkinson
 
[1927] AC 177 (
17.2.1
), 
Redgrave
 
v.
Hurd
 
(1881) 20 Ch D 1 (
17.4.1
), and 
Edgington
 
v. 
Fitzmaurice
 
(1885) 29 Ch D 459
(
17.2.2
) make frequent references to the existence or otherwise of a ‘material’ statement.
There are two difficulties here. The first relates to the meaning of ‘material’. It would
appear that a ‘material’ statement is one that would affect the mind of a reasonable
person in deciding whether or not to enter into a contract. The second difficulty relates
to the role played by materiality in the case-law. Many of the references appear to be in
the context of deciding whether or not the misrepresentation was an inducement to
entry into the contract. But it is possible to argue 
that the requirement of ‘materiality’ (if
there is such a requirement) is analytically distinct from the question of inducement.
The difficult case is the case in which a party is induced to enter into a contract by a
misrepresentation which is objectively immaterial. Such cases are unlikely to arise in
practice because a court in such a case will, in all probability, find on the facts that the
representation did not induce the party concerned to enter into the contract. The
authorities suggest that the courts adopt the following approach: where the
misrepresentation is of such a nature that it would have induced a reasonable person to
enter into the contract then the court will presume that it did induce the representee to
enter into the contract and the onus of proof then switches to the party who made the
statement to show that the representee did not in fact rely on the representation in
entering into the contract (
Museprime Properties Ltd
 
v. 
Adhill Properties Ltd
 
(1991) 61
P & CR 111, 124). By contrast, in the case where the statement would not have induced a
reasonable person to enter into a contract in reliance upon the statement, the onus of
proof rests upon the recipient of the statement to show that the misrepresentation did in
fact induce him to enter into the contract (
Dadourian Group International Inc
 
v. 
Simms
[2009] EWCA Civ 169, [2009] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 601, [99]–[101]). In any event, the
materiality requirement does not apply where the representation was made fraudulently
(
Ross River Ltd
 
v. 
Cambridge City Football Club Ltd
 
[2007] EWHC 2115 (Ch), [2008] 1
All ER 1004).
Seventhly, the misrepresentation must have induced the claimant to enter into the
contract. This apparently straightforward statement has, however, given rise to some
real difficulties. That said, some points can be established with a high degree of
certainty. First, a misrepresentation which is the ‘but for’ cause of the representee
entering into the contract on the represented terms satisfies the text for the existence of
an inducement. Second, and at the other end of the spectrum, a misrepresentation
which had no impact whatsoever on the decision of the representee to enter into the
contract is not an inducement to entry into the contract. So, if the representee would
have acted in exactly the same way in the absence of the misrepresentation, a claim
brought by the representee in respect of the misrepresentation will fail (
Versloot
Dredging BV
 
v. 
HDI Gerling Industrie Versicherung AG
 
[2016] UKSC 45, [2017] AC 1,
[29]). A misrepresentation may have no impact on the representee for a number of
reasons. For example, the representee may have been unaware of the existence of the
statement at the time of entry into the contract (
Horsfall
 
v. 
Thomas
 
(1862) 1 H & C 90),
the representee may have placed his reliance upon a third party when entering into the
contract (
Atwood
 
v. 
Small
 
(1838) 6 C & F 232), or the representor may have corrected
his misrepresentation and actually drawn the representee’s attention to the correction
prior to any reliance upon it (
Peekay Intermark Ltd
 
v. 
Australia and New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd
 
[2006] EWCA Civ 386, [2006] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 511). Third, the fact
that the representee could have discovered the true position by acting in a more diligent
fashion does not, of itself, prevent him from asserting that he was induced to enter into
the contract in reliance upon the misrepresentation made (see 
Redgrave
 
v. 
Hurd
 
(1881)
20 Ch D 1, 
17.4.1
). Fourth, the onus of proof is upon the representee to prove that the
misrepresentation induced him to enter into the contract (
BV Nederlandse Industrie
van Eiprodukten
 
v. 
Rembrandt Enterprises Inc
 
[2019] EWCA Civ 596, [2020] QB 551,
[15]).
Matters get more difficult in the case where the representee cannot satisfy the ‘but for’
test for causation. In such a case, on one view, the representee must fail because the
requisite threshold has not been overcome (see N Venkatesan (2021) 137 
LQR
 
503). But
there is also authority for the proposition that it suffices for the representee to prove
that the misrepresentation was actively present to his mind at the time at which he
entered into the contract (
BV Nederlandse Industrie van Eiprodukten
 
v. 
Rembrandt
Enterprises Inc
 
[2019] EWCA Civ 
596, [2020] QB 551, [32]). The context for this
lowered threshold is frequently a claim in respect of a fraudulent misrepresentation and
one can understand the sentiment that leads the court to be reluctant to allow a
fraudulent party to escape liability by asserting that his false representation, while an
inducement to entry into the contract, was not important enough to satisfy the ‘but for’
test. Tempting though it is to relax the relevant threshold, the ‘but for’ test is an
important rule given that it is ‘fundamental that the representee must have acted on the
misrepresentation’ (
Versloot Dredging BV
 
v. 
HDI Gerling Industrie Vershicherung AG
[2016] UKSC 45, [2017] AC 1, [29]) and it should not be lightly departed from. While the
misrepresentation need not have been the only inducement to entry into the contract
(
Edgington

Fitzmaurice
 
(1885) 29 Ch D 459,

) it should nevertheless satisfy the
‘but for’ test of causation if it is to give rise to a claim in respect of that
misrepresentation.
These principles can be seen at work in the following three cases:
17.2.1
 
Statements of Opinion
BISSET V. WILKINSON
[1927] AC 177, Privy Council
In May 1919 Wilkinson agreed to purchase from Bisset two adjoining blocks of
land in New Zealand called ‘Homestead’ and ‘Hogan’s’. Wilkinson purchased the
land for the purpose of sheep farming. In accordance with the agreement
Wilkinson paid part of the purchase price on the signing of the agreement. The
balance was payable in May 1924 and interest was to be paid half-yearly in the
meantime. Wilkinson took possession of the land but soon after experienced
difficulties and did not make the interest payments when they fell due. When Bisset
brought an action to recover the overdue interest payments Wilkinson sought to
have the agreement rescinded, alleging that Bisset had misrepresented that the
land ‘had a carrying capacity of 2000 sheep if only one team were employed in the
agricultural work of the land’. Bisset argued that the representation was a
statement of opinion, which he honestly held, and so was not actionable. The New
Zealand Court of Appeal held that the representation was an untrue statement of
fact and set aside the agreement. The Privy Council allowed Bisset’s appeal and
held that the representation was a statement of opinion, which Bisset honestly held
and was not actionable.
Lord Merrivale
[delivering the judgment of the Board]
In an action for rescission, as in an action for specific performance of an
executory contract, when misrepresentation is the alleged ground of relief of the
party who repudiates the contract, it is, of course, essential to ascertain whether
that which is relied upon is a representation of a specific fact, or a statement of
opinion, since an erroneous opinion stated by the party affirming the contract,
though it may have been relied upon and have induced the contract on the part of
the party who seeks rescission, gives no title to relief unless fraud is established.
The application of this rule, however, is not always easy, as is illustrated in a good
many reported cases, as well as in this. A representation of fact may be inherent in
a statement of opinion and, at any rate, the existence of the opinion in the 
person
stating it is a question of fact … In 
Smith
 
v. 
Land and House Property Corporation
(1884) 28 Ch D 7, 15 there came in question a vendor’s description of the tenant of
the property sold as ‘a most desirable tenant’—a statement of his opinion, as was
argued on his behalf in an action to enforce the contract of sale. This description
was held by the Court of Appeal to be a misrepresentation of fact, which, without
proof of fraud, disentitled the vendor to specific performance of the contract of
purchase. ‘It is often fallaciously assumed’, said Bowen LJ, ‘that a statement of
opinion cannot involve the statement of fact. In a case where the facts are equally
well known to both parties, what one of them says to the other is frequently nothing
but an expression of opinion. The statement of such opinion is in a sense a
statement of fact, about the condition of the man’s own mind, but only of an
irrelevant fact, for it is of no consequence what the opinion is. But if the facts are
not equally well known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by one who
knows the facts best involves very often a statement of a material fact, for he
impliedly states that he knows facts which justify his opinion.’ The kind of
distinction which is in question is illustrated again in a well-known case of 
Smith
 
v.
Chadwick
 
(1884) 9 App Cas 187; (1882) 20 Ch D 27. There the words under
consideration involved the inquiry in relation to the sale of an industrial concern
whether a statement of ‘the present value of the turnover or output’ was of
necessity a statement of fact that the produce of the works was of the amount
mentioned, or might be and was a statement that the productive power of the
works was estimated at so much. The words were held to be capable of the
second of these meanings. The decisive inquiries came to be: what meaning was
actually conveyed to the party complaining; was he deceived, and, as the action
was based on a charge of fraud, was the statement in question made fraudulently?
In the present case, as in those cited, the material facts of the transaction, the
knowledge of the parties respectively, and their relative positions, the words of
representation used, and the actual condition of the subject matter spoken of, are
relevant to the two inquiries necessary to be made: What was the meaning of the
representation? Was it true?
In ascertaining what meaning was conveyed to the minds of the now
respondents by the appellant’s statement as to the two thousand sheep, the most
material fact to be remembered is that, as both parties were aware, the appellant
had not and, so far as appears, no other person had at any time carried on sheep-
farming upon the unit of land in question. That land as a distinct holding had never
constituted a sheep-farm. The two blocks comprised in it differed substantially in
character. Hogan’s block was described by one of the respondents’ witnesses as
‘better land’. ‘It might carry’, he said, ‘one sheep or perhaps two or even three
sheep to the acre’. He estimated the carrying capacity of the land generally as little
more than half a sheep to the acre. And Hogan’s land had been allowed to
deteriorate during several years before the respondents purchased. As was said
by Sim J: ‘In ordinary circumstances, any statement made by an owner who has
been occupying his own farm as to its carrying capacity would be regarded as a
statement of fact. … This, however, is not such a case. The defendants knew all
about Hogan’s block and knew also what sheep the farm was carrying when they
inspected it. In these circumstances … the defendants were not justified in
regarding anything said by the plaintiff as to the carrying capacity as being
anything more than an expression of his opinion on the subject.’ In this view of the
matter their Lordships concur.
Whether the appellant honestly and in fact held the opinion which he stated
remained to be considered. This involved examination of the history and condition
of the property. If a reasonable man with the appellant’s knowledge could not have
come to the conclusion he stated, the description of that conclusion as an opinion
would not necessarily protect him against rescission for misrepresentation. But
what was actually the capacity in competent 
hands of the land the respondents
purchased had never been, and never was, practically ascertained. The
respondents, after two years’ trial of sheep-farming, under difficulties caused in
part by their inexperience, found themselves confronted by a fall in the values of
sheep and wool which would have left them losers if they could have carried three
thousand sheep. As is said in the judgment of Ostler J: ‘Owing to sheep becoming
practically valueless, they reduced their flock and went in for cropping and dairy-
farming in order to make a living’. …
After attending to the close and very careful examination of the evidence which
was made by learned counsel for each of the parties their Lordships entirely
concur in the view which was expressed by the learned judge who heard the case.
The defendants failed to prove that the farm if properly managed was not capable
of carrying two thousand sheep.
Commentary
Bisset
 
was narrowly interpreted by the Court of Appeal in 
Esso Petroleum Ltd
 
v.
Mardon
 
[1976] QB 801 (see 
8.3.1
). Lord Denning there distinguished 
Bisset
 
on the
ground that ‘the land had never been used as a sheep farm and both parties were equally
able to form an opinion as to its carrying capacity’. The key fact would therefore appear
to be that the vendor was not possessed of any special skill or expertise in relation to
sheep farming. The position is otherwise where, as in 
Esso
, the maker of the statement
does profess to have some special skill or expertise in relation to the subject matter of
his statement of opinion. In such a case the courts will readily imply that the maker of
the statement is subject to a duty to make the statement with reasonable care and skill.
The effect of this implication is to leave the maker of the statement potentially exposed
to a claim for misrepresentation when he makes the statement without exercising
reasonable care and skill. It should be noted that the Privy Council in 
Bisset
 
did not deny
the possibility that a claim for misrepresentation could arise out of a statement which
could be classified as one of opinion. Lord Merrivale cites with approval a passage from
the judgment of Bowen LJ in 
Smith
 
v. 
Land and House Property Corporation
 
(1884) 28
Ch D 7, 15 where he states that:
if the facts are not equally well known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by one who knows the facts
best involves very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly states that he knows facts which justify
his opinion.
On the facts of 
Smith
 
a vendor of property described a tenant as ‘a most desirable
tenant’ when the vendor knew that part of the tenant’s rent remained unpaid and other
instalments had only been paid under the threat of legal proceedings. The vendor
argued that his statement was a statement of opinion which was not actionable. His
argument was rejected on the basis that his statement was held to contain an implied
assertion that he knew of no facts which would lead to the conclusion that the tenant
was not in fact a ‘most desirable tenant’. It is, however, important to note that Bowen LJ
is here dealing with the case where the ‘facts are not equally well known to both sides’.
In the case where there is no such imbalance in knowledge, a court may refuse to make
the implication (see, for example, 
Economides
 
v. 
Commercial Union Assurance Co plc
[1998] QB 587). Equally, a representor who declines 
to assume responsibility for the
accuracy of the information which he has passed on to the claimant; in such a case, the
express refusal to assume responsibility is likely to negate any implication that the
representor knows facts which justify his opinion (

17.2.2
 
Statements of Intention and Inducement
EDGINGTON V. FITZMAURICE
(1885) 29 Ch D 459, Court of Appeal
The plaintiff, Mr Edgington, was a shareholder in a company of which the
defendants were officers. The directors issued a prospectus which invited
shareholders to subscribe to debenture bonds. It stated that the bonds were being
issued for the purpose of (i) making improvements to a property recently
purchased by the company, (ii) the development of a transport service for the
company through the purchase of horses and vans, and (iii) the further
development of their business of supplying cheap fish from the coast. The plaintiff
also wrote to the company secretary and asked whether or not the debentures
would be a first charge on the property. The company secretary confirmed that
they would be.
The company was later wound up and the assets were insufficient to pay the
debenture holders more than a small dividend. The plaintiff brought an action
against the defendants to recover the sum of money advanced by him on the
ground that he had been induced to pay the money by fraudulent
misrepresentations for which the defendants were responsible. The defendants
denied liability. The Court of Appeal held, affirming the decision of Denman J, that
the plaintiff was entitled to recover the money in an action in deceit on the basis
that he had been induced to pay the money to the company by the fraudulent
misrepresentation of the defendants as to the purpose for which the debentures
were issued.
Bowen LJ
This is an action for deceit, in which the Plaintiff complains that he was induced to
take certain debentures by the misrepresentations of the Defendants, and that he
sustained damage thereby …
The alleged misrepresentations were three [he considered the first two
misrepresentations and concluded that there was insufficient proof that the
misrepresentations had been made fraudulently and continued]
But when we come to the third alleged misstatement I feel that the Plaintiff’s
case is made out. I mean the statement of the objects for which the money was to
be raised. These were stated to be to complete the alterations and additions to the
buildings, to purchase horses and vans, and to develop the supply of fish. A mere
suggestion of possible purposes to which a portion of the money might be applied
would not have formed a basis for an action of deceit. There must be a
misstatement of an existing fact: but the state of a man’s mind is as much a fact as
the state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state of a
man’s mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as
anything else. A misrepresentation as to the state of a man’s mind is, therefore, a
misstatement of fact. Having applied as careful consideration to the evidence as I
could, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the true objects of the
Defendants in raising the money were not those stated in the circular …
Then the question remains—Did this misstatement contribute to induce the
Plaintiff to advance his money? … What is the first question which a man asks
when he advances money? It is, what is it wanted for? Therefore I think that the
statement is material, and that the Plaintiff would be unlike the rest of his race if he
was not influenced by the statement of the objects for which the loan was required.
The learned Judge in the Court below came to the conclusion that the
misstatement did influence him, and I think he came to a right conclusion.
Fry LJ
It is clear that their [the defendants’] object in raising the money was to meet their
pressing liabilities. … But the statement in the prospectus was that a large sum of
money had been already expended in improving the building … and that the
directors intended to apply the money raised by the debentures in further
improving the buildings. This statement was therefore false …
The next inquiry is whether this statement materially affected the conduct of the
Plaintiff in advancing his money. He has sworn that it did, and the learned Judge
who tried the action has believed him. On such a point I should not like to differ
from the Judge who tried the action, even though I were not myself convinced, but
in this case the natural inference from the facts is in accordance with the Judge’s
conclusion. The prospectus was intended to influence the mind of the reader. Then
this question has been raised: the Plaintiff admits that he was induced to make the
advance not merely by this false statement, but by the belief that the debentures
would give him a charge on the company’s property, and it is admitted that this was
a mistake of the Plaintiff. Therefore it is said that the Plaintiff was the author of his
own injury. It is quite true that the Plaintiff was influenced by his own mistake, but
that does not benefit the Defendants’ case. The Plaintiff says: I had two
inducements, one my own mistake, the other the false statement of the
Defendants. The two together induced me to advance the money. But in my
opinion if the false statement of fact actually influenced the Plaintiff, the
Defendants are liable, even though the Plaintiff may have been also influenced by
other motives. I think, therefore, the Defendants must be held liable. The appeal
must therefore be dismissed.
Cotton LJ
 
delivered a concurring judgment.
Commentary
On the facts of this case, the plaintiff had no effective claim against the company
(because it was insolvent) and so he brought the claim against the directors instead. Two
points of significance emerge from the case. The first is that it demonstrates that a
statement of intention can be actionable in a case where the maker of the statement mis-
states his present intention. In Bowen LJ’s memorable phrase, ‘the state of a man’s mind
is as much a fact as the state of his digestion’. As Bowen LJ acknowledges, it can be
extremely difficult to prove that a person has in fact mis-stated his present intention. A
party who truly states his present intention but then changes his mind does not commit
a misrepresentation. In the absence of a binding promise not to change his mind, the
maker of the statement is free to change his mind without incurring any liability for
doing so (
Kleinwort Benson Ltd
 
v. 
Malaysia Mining Corporation Berhad
 
[1989] 1 WLR
379; 
Wales
 
v. 
Wadham
 
[1977] 1 WLR 199).
The second point to note is that the plaintiff advanced the money under the erroneous
belief that he was entitled to a first charge on the property of the company. This was
therefore 
not a case in which the plaintiff was relying solely upon the statements
contained in the prospectus. This was held to be no barrier to the plaintiff’s action. As
Fry LJ stated, provided that the false statement of fact actually influenced the plaintiff,
he was entitled to succeed in his claim notwithstanding the fact that he was also
influenced to enter into the transaction by other factors.
17.2.3
 
Statements Made by Conduct
SPICE GIRLS LTD V. APRILIA WORLD SERVICE BV
[2002] EWCA Civ 15, [2002] EMLR 27, Court of Appeal
The claimants, Spice Girls Ltd (‘SGL’), entered into a contract with the defendants,
Aprilia World Service (‘AWS’), a manufacturer of motorcycles and scooters,
according to which the latter agreed to sponsor the Spice Girls’ concert tour in
return for promotional work carried out by the group. The contract between the
parties was signed on 6 May 1998. One of the members of the Spice Girls, Ms
Geri Halliwell, left the band on 27 May 1998. The defendants subsequently
discovered that Ms Halliwell had informed the other members of the group of her
decision to leave prior to the conclusion of the contract with the defendants. In
these circumstances the defendants claimed that they had been induced to enter
into the contract by a misrepresentation made by the claimants. The claimants
denied that any misrepresentation had been made and, for this purpose, relied
upon a clause in the contract which stated that the defendants were entitled to the
‘endorsement rights of the group of individuals performing under the professional
name “Spice Girls” (currently comprising … )’. In their submission, this statement
was true because Ms Halliwell was a member of the band at the time the contract
was concluded and the risk that one of the members of the group would
subsequently decide to leave had been allocated to AWS.
The misrepresentation relied upon by AWS was that SGL did not know and had
no reasonable grounds to believe at or before the time of entry into the agreement
that any of the Spice Girls had an existing declared intention to leave the group
during the minimum term of the agreement. The trial judge, Arden J, concluded
that there had been a misrepresentation by conduct in that all five members of the
group participated in a commercial photo shoot on 4 May 1998 at considerable
cost to the defendants at a time when they knew, but the defendants did not, that
Geri Halliwell intended to leave the group. The Court of Appeal affirmed the
decision of Arden J but did so on a wider basis. It relied upon a number of factors
in reaching the conclusion that the claimants had, by their conduct, conveyed to
the defendants the impression that all members of the group were committed to
the contract with the defendants and that none of them had an existing, declared
intention to leave the group.
Morritt V-C
[delivering the judgment of the court]
The representation
51. At the outset it is necessary to reiterate certain well-established principles.
First, though the representation must be one of fact representations as to the
future or of opinion frequently contain implied representations with regard to the
present or to the knowledge of 
the representor. … Second, a representation once
made is likely to have continuing effect. So if made for the purpose of an intended
transaction it will continue until the transaction is completed or abandoned or the
representation ceases to be operative on the mind of the representee; 
With
 
v.
O’Flanagan
 
[1936] 1 Ch 575, at 585. Third, if at a time when it is continuing the
representor discovers that the representation was false when made or has become
false since he should correct it. The principle is most clearly expounded in the
judgment of Romer LJ in 
With
 
v. 
O’Flanagan
 
[1936] 1 Ch 575 [see 
17.3
] … Fourth,
the meaning and effect of a statement or of conduct must be ascertained in the
light of the circumstances pertaining at the time. Those circumstances will include
the course of the negotiations and any earlier representations.
52.
 
The representation for which AWS has contended ever since it amended
its defence and counterclaim in December 1999 is that ‘SGL did not know and had
no reasonable grounds to believe at or before the time of entry into the agreement
that any of the Spice Girls had an existing declared intention to leave the group
during the minimum term of the Agreement’, i.e. before March 1999. This was
accepted by the judge … but only in respect of the commercial shoot on May 4,
1998 and ‘other promotional material depicting the five Spice Girls which was
intended to be used at any time during the period of the agreement’.
53.
 
In our view the judge took too limited a view of the effect of the course of
the negotiations as a whole and the specific documents and conduct relied on. We
have already described the course of negotiations in some detail. Accordingly at
this stage it is sufficient to highlight the most salient facts and events.
54.
 
First, shortly after the conclusion of the heads of agreement on March 4,
1998 SGL supplied the logos, images and designs depicting each of the Spice
Girls which were to be used by Aprilia in the promotion of the scooters. It must
have been quite obvious from all such material and the judge’s finding … that the
same five girls were required for all of them. AWS was entitled to use them
throughout the period of 12 months. … As we understand it such material was
consistently used thereafter so as to generate a connection in the public eye
between the Spice Girls and the scooters. In our view the representation
contended for is necessarily implicit in that conduct from early March 1998
onwards. …
55.
 
Second, the events of March 9, 1998 [when Geri Halliwell told the
members of the group, shortly before they went on stage in Milan, that she had
had enough and definitely intended to leave the group in September] were such as
to bring to the attention of four of the other five directors of SGL the fact that Ms
Halliwell had declared her intention to leave in September 1998. It follows that the
representation implicit in the approval and use of the promotional material was
false when made, or to the extent it was made before March 9, became false on
March 9, 1998. The fact that the other Spice Girls mistakenly as it turned out did
not take Ms Halliwell seriously is immaterial.
56.
 
Third, the subsequent events merely served to affirm, not correct, the initial
representation and its falsity. …
57.
 
Fourth, the fax of March 30, 1998 … was an express assurance that each
Spice Girl was fully committed to all the matters contained in the heads of
agreement and in the draft agreement then circulating for the full term of 12
months. There is implicit in such assurance the representation for which AWS
contends. That representation was false when made because of the declaration of
intention made by Ms Halliwell on March 9, 1998 and never qualified or withdrawn.
The fact that Mr Pettett did not consider that he was making such a representation
is irrelevant. … Knowledge of the fax is to be attributed to SGL because KLP was
its agent …
58.
 
Fifth, the events of the meeting held at Wembley on April 25, 1998 [when
Geri Halliwell confirmed at a meeting of the group and their legal advisers that she
was going to leave the group at the end of their American tour] demonstrated quite
conclusively the falsity of all the representations previously made. Whichever
formulation of the principle enunciated in 
With
 
v. 
O’Flanagan
 
is adopted and
whatever view is taken of the declaration made by Ms Halliwell on March 9, 1998 it
is quite clear that SGL could no longer deal with AWS on the previous basis
without disclosing Ms Halliwell’s expressed intention …
59.
 
Sixth, it is clear that far from correcting the previous misrepresentations
SGL continued and affirmed them. There was the draft agreement originally issued
on March 24 and reissued on April 30. No doubt the phrase ‘currently comprising’
points primarily to the present (whether at the time of the draft or as of the
imminent time when the Agreement was executed) and in that limited sense was
true. But to our minds, in the context of the surrounding circumstances, it was
concerned with an agreement which would continue into the future, in much the
same sense as the conduct of SGL in approving the promotional material or of the
Spice Girls in participating in the commercial shoot, in each case, for future use. In
these two latter senses there was implicit in the representation derived from the
conduct of SGL in circulating the draft agreement with the phrase ‘currently
comprising’ the representation for which AWS contends. It follows that, in that
context, to say that the Spice Girls currently comprised the five named individuals
without going on to say that one of them was going to leave within the period of the
Agreement was false when made. What was omitted rendered that which was
actually stated false or misleading in the context in which it was made: see 
Chitty
on Contracts
 
(1999, 28th ed), Volume 1, paragraph 6–016.
60.
 
Seventh, as the judge held, participation in the commercial shoot
necessarily carried the same implication and was likewise false. It did nothing to
correct the previous misrepresentations, indeed it gave them additional force. …
63.
 
Whilst it is necessary to give each episode separate consideration it is also
necessary to have regard to their cumulative effect. This is not a case of an
isolated representation made at an early stage of ongoing negotiations. It is the
case of a series of continuing representations made throughout the two months’
negotiations leading to the Agreement. Later representations gave added force to
the earlier ones; earlier representations gave focus to the later ones. It is in this
context, not the much more limited one the judge adopted, that the submissions for
SGL as to inducement and reliance must be considered. …
73.
 
For all these reasons, while we consider that the judge took too narrow a
view as to what representations were made and when, we do not accept the
submissions for SGL that section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 is
inapplicable. Subject to proof of damage, we conclude that SGL is liable to AWS
under that provision.
Commentary
Spice Girls
 
neatly illustrates the problems that can arise from the fact that English law
neither recognizes a duty of disclosure (
17.3
) nor a duty of good faith in the negotiation
of a contract (
Chapter 15
). The source of AWS’s complaint was that SGL had failed to
inform them that Geri Halliwell had already decided to leave the group before the
contract was concluded. But they could not plead the claim on this basis nor could they
rely on a failure to act in good faith. Instead, they had to spell out from the conduct of
SGL a representation which would give them a cause of action. While AWS were
prepared to take the risk that one of the members of the group would decide to leave the
group during the currency of the agreement 
(this risk seems inherent in the phrase
‘currently comprising’), they were not prepared to take the risk that one of the members
had already decided to leave the group prior to the conclusion of the contract and told
other members of the group of her decision, but did not tell the defendants. The basis on
which counsel for AWS formulated the representation can be found in paragraph [52] of
the judgment of the Court of Appeal. If this was the representation, when did it become
a misrepresentation? Arden J took a narrow view and concluded that it became a
misrepresentation at the point at which the Spice Girls, including Geri Halliwell,
participated in the commercial shoot on 4 May 1998. She stated ([2000] EMLR 479 at
[112] of her judgment):
Given that the benefits of the commercial shoot could not be enjoyed by Aprilia if one of the Spice Girls left the
group before March 1999, participation in the shoot in my judgment carried with it a representation by conduct
that SGL did not know, and had no reasonable ground to believe, that any of the Spice Girls had an existing
declared intention to leave the group before that date. Nothing was done to correct that representation which
was a continuing representation. It was on the facts found material to Aprilia’s decision to enter into the
agreement that none of the Spice Girls was intending to leave in the contract period. Accordingly, SGL had a
duty to correct its misrepresentation. What I have said about the commercial shoot must equally apply to other
promotional material depicting the five Spice Girls which was intended to be used at any time during the period
of the agreement.
The Court of Appeal took a broader view of the facts and relied upon a range of factors
(set out in [54]–[60] of their judgment). While these factors, standing alone, might not
have been decisive, taken together (see [63]) they painted a picture which was false and
therefore amounted to a misrepresentation.
Spice Girls
 
would have been a much easier case for AWS if English law had recognized a
duty of disclosure or a duty of good faith. The arguments for and against the
introduction of a doctrine of good faith in English law have been canvassed in 
Chapter
15
 
but here it is necessary to consider the law relating to the existence, or otherwise, of a
duty of disclosure.
17.3
 
Duty of Disclosure
English law does recognize a limited group of cases in which a duty of disclosure is
imposed upon the parties to the contract. These are known as contracts of the utmost
good faith or contracts ‘
uberrimae fidei
’. Very few contracts fall into this category. The
leading example is a contract of insurance where the insured is subject to a duty to
disclose all facts which a reasonable or prudent insurer would regard as material to his
decision to enter into the particular contract of insurance (although, in the case of a
consumer insurance contract, the duty owed by the consumer is now one to take
reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to the insurer, and this duty replaces
any duty of disclosure previously owed by the consumer to the insurer in such
circumstances: Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012, section
2). English law also imposes a duty of disclosure in certain categories of fiduciary
relationship where one party reposes trust and confidence in the other party. The party
in whom trust and confidence is reposed may be subject to a duty of disclosure.
As a general rule, however, English law does not recognize the existence of a duty to
disclose material facts known to one party but not to the other (
Keates
 
v. 
Cadogan
(1851) 10 CB 591). As Viscount Maugham stated in 
Bradford Third Equitable Benefit
Building Society
 
v. 
Borders
 
[1941] 2 All ER 205, 211 ‘mere silence, however morally
wrong, will not support an action of deceit’. The word ‘mere’ is important. Something
more than silence is therefore required in order to constitute a representation of fact.
But that ‘something more’ can take many different forms. English law does not require
that the representation take the form of words. As 
Spice Girls
 
demonstrates, the
representation can be made by conduct or can be inferred from the facts and
circumstances of the case. In particular, the courts have been willing to find the
existence of a misrepresentation in cases where one party has actively sought to conceal
a defect in the subject matter of the contract from the other party. A number of
examples can be provided of this phenomenon.
First, a misrepresentation can be made by conduct. Information can be conveyed as
much by conduct as by words, and the courts have generally been willing to imply
representations by conduct in ordinary dealings. Thus a buyer who orders goods
impliedly represents that he intends to pay for them (
Re Shackleton, ex parte Whittaker
(1875) LR 10 Ch App 446, 449 per Sir G Mellish LJ), and a person who sits down in a
restaurant and orders a meal impliedly represents that he has the means to pay for the
meal (
DPP
 
v. 
Ray
 
[1974] AC 370). The proposition that representations can be made by
conduct is also demonstrated by the 
Spice Girls
 
case. Further support for the
proposition that a representation can be made by conduct can be derived from the case
of 
Walters
 
v. 
Morgan
 
(1861) 3 D F & G 718, 723–724, where Lord Campbell LC stated
that, while simple reticence does not amount to a legal fraud:
a nod or a wink, or a shake of the head, or a smile from the purchaser intended to induce the vendor to believe
the existence of a non-existing fact, which might influence the price of the subject to be sold
would be a sufficient ground for refusing to enforce a contract.
Secondly, a court may be prepared to infer a misrepresentation where there has been an
active attempt to conceal a defect. This proposition is illustrated by the case of 
Schneider
v. 
Heath
 
(1813) 3 Camp 506 which concerned the sale of a ship ‘to be taken with all
faults’. The plaintiff purchased the vessel and, after taking possession of it, he took it to a
shipwright to be examined, where it was discovered that the bottom of the ship was
worm-eaten and the keel broken. The plaintiff brought an action to recover the deposit
paid for the purchase of the vessel on the ground that he had been induced to enter into
the contract by the misrepresentation and fraud on the part of the vendor. It was held
that he was entitled to recover his deposit. Mansfield CJ stated (at p. 509) that ‘it
appears here that means were taken fraudulently to conceal the defect in the ship’s
bottom’ in that the captain removed the vessel from a dry dock and kept her afloat until
the sale was over. He did so for the purpose of preventing potential buyers from
discovering the true state of the vessel and this was held to amount to a fraudulent
misrepresentation (see to similar effect 
Gordon
 
v. 
Selico
 
(1985) 275 EG 899 (Goulding
J) and (1986) 11 HLR 219 (CA), where it was held that the vendors had made a
misrepresentation when they covered up dry rot in a flat before putting the flat up for
sale).
Thirdly, a partial non-disclosure may amount to a misrepresentation (see 
Spice Girls
Ltd
 
v. 
Aprilia World Service BV
, [59]). In 
Peek
 
v. 
Gurney
 
(1873) 8 LR 6 HL 377 Lord
Chancellor Chelmsford stated (at pp. 391–392) that:
[i]t is said that the prospectus is true as far as it goes, but half a truth will sometimes amount to a real falsehood;
and I go farther and say, that to my mind it contains a positive misrepresentation.
And in 
Arkwright
 
v. 
Newbold
 
(1881) 17 Ch D 301, 318 James LJ stated:
Supposing you state a thing partially, you may make as false a statement as much as if you misstated it
altogether. Every word may be true, but if you leave out something which qualifies it you may make a false
statement. For instance, if pretending to set out the report of a surveyor, you set out two passages in his report,
and leave out a third passage which qualifies them, that is an actual misstatement.
Suppression of material facts can also render a statement false. In 
Dimmock
 
v. 
Hallett
(1866) LR 2 Ch App 21 a vendor of land told a purchaser that all the farms on the land
were fully let but did not inform him that the tenants had given notice to quit. This was
held to be a misrepresentation (see also 
Central Railway Co of Venezuela
 
v. 
Kisch
(1867) LR 2 HL 99, 114). A statement may also amount to a misrepresentation if it is
literally true but it implies certain additional facts which are themselves false. In
Goldsmith
 
v. 
Rodger
 
[1962] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 249 a purchaser of a yacht negotiated a
reduction in the price of the yacht after he told the seller that he had found defects in the
yacht’s keel. The statement that he had found defects in the keel was held to amount to a
representation that he had taken the boat out and discovered the defect in the keel. The
purchaser not having done this, it was held that his statement amounted to a
misrepresentation.
Fourthly, a statement which is literally true but is nevertheless misleading because the
maker of the statement has failed to disclose all the relevant information may amount to
a misrepresentation. This could be regarded as another example of a partial non-
disclosure. In 
Notts Patent Brick and Tile Co
 
v. 
Butler
 
(1866) 16 QBD 778 a purchaser of
land asked the vendor’s solicitors whether the land was subject to restrictive covenants.
The solicitor replied that he was not aware of any, but did not say that the reason for his
ignorance was that he had not bothered to check. It was held that, although the
solicitor’s statement was literally true, it nevertheless amounted to a misrepresentation.
Lord Esher MR stated (at pp. 787–788) that:
the evidence has been read to us, and I am sorry to say that I have come to the conclusion that the defendant’s
solicitor allowed himself to be carried away by his zeal for his client, and that he did not act with that candour to
the other side with which a solicitor is bound to act under such circumstances. He allowed himself, in his zeal
for his client, to make statements which were calculated to lead the other side to believe that he was stating facts
within his own knowledge, and his statements in fact misled them, so that what he said amounts to a mis-
statement of facts.
Finally, a person may be held to have made a misrepresentation where he fails to correct
a representation which, when made was true, but which subsequently, to his knowledge,
has 
become false or which, at the time of making it, he believed to be true, but which he
has subsequently discovered to be false. The leading example of a case in this category is
the following decision of the Court of Appeal.
WITH V. O’FLANAGAN
[1936] Ch 575, Court of Appeal
In January 1934, the plaintiffs entered into negotiations for the purchase of the
defendant’s medical practice. Dr O’Flanagan represented that the takings of the
practice were £2,000 per annum. This statement was true at the time that it was
made but, when Dr O’Flanagan subsequently fell seriously ill and a number of
locums ran the practice, the takings fell to an average of £5 per week. This change
in circumstances was not revealed to the plaintiffs before the contract was signed
in May 1934. The plaintiffs brought an action for rescission of the agreement. The
trial judge refused to set aside the agreement on the basis that the representation
was true when it was made and that there was no duty on the defendant to
disclose the change in circumstances. The Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiffs’
appeal and held that the defendant had made a misrepresentation in failing to
reveal the change of circumstances and that, accordingly, the agreement between
the parties should be set aside.
Lord Wright MR
[set out the facts and continued]
As to the law, which has been challenged, I want to say this. I take the law to
be as it was stated by Fry J in 
Davies
 
v. 
London and Provincial Marine Insurance
Co
. 8 Ch D 469. …
The learned judge points out (at p. 474): ‘Where parties are contracting with
one another, each may, unless there be a duty to disclose, observe silence even in
regard to facts which he believes would be operative upon the mind of the other;
and it rests upon those who say that there was a duty to disclose, to shew that the
duty existed’. Then the learned judge points out that in many cases there is such a
duty as between persons in a confidential or a fiduciary relationship where the pre-
existing relationship involves the duty of entire disclosure. Then his Lordship says:
‘In the next place, there are certain contracts which have been called contracts
uberrimae fidei where, from their nature, the Court requires disclosure from one of
the contracting parties’. The learned judge refers to contracts of partnership and
marine insurance. Then he goes on (at p. 475): ‘Again, in ordinary contracts the
duty may arise from circumstances which occur during the negotiation. Thus, for
instance, if one of the negotiating parties has made a statement which is false in
fact, but which he believes to be true and which is material to the contract, and
during the course of the negotiation he discovers the falsity of that statement, he is
under an obligation to correct his erroneous statement; although if he had said
nothing he very likely might have been entitled to hold his tongue throughout’.
Then he adds what was material in that case and what is material in this case: ‘So,
again, if a statement has been made which is true at the time, but which during the
course of the negotiations becomes untrue, then the person who knows that it has
become untrue is under an obligation to disclose to the other the change of
circumstances’.
The matter, however, may be put in another way though with the same effect,
and that is on the ground that a representation made as a matter of inducement to
enter into a contract is to be treated as a continuing representation. That view of
the position was put in 
Smith
 
v. 
Kay
 
7 HLC 750, 769 by Lord Cranworth. He says
of a representation made in negotiation 
some time before the date of a contract: ‘It
is a continuing representation. The representation does not end for ever when the
representation is once made; it continues on. The pleader who drew the bill, or the
young man himself, in stating his case, would say, Before I executed the bond I
had been led to believe, and I therefore continued to believe, that it was executed
pursuant to the arrangement.’ …
On these grounds, with great respect to the learned judge, I think he ought to
have come to the conclusion that the plaintiffs have established their case and
there ought to be a declaration rescinding the contract with the consequences
which follow upon such a declaration.
Romer LJ
I agree. The only principle invoked by the appellants in this case is as follows. If A
with a view to inducing B to enter into a contract makes a representation as to a
material fact, then if at a later date and before the contract is actually entered into,
owing to a change of circumstances, the representation then made would to the
knowledge of A be untrue and B subsequently enters into the contract in ignorance
of that change of circumstances and relying upon that representation, A cannot
hold B to the bargain. There is ample authority for that statement and, indeed, I
doubt myself whether any authority is necessary, it being, it seems to me, so
obviously consistent with the plainest principles of equity.
The only questions therefore that we have to decide in the present case are,
first, what was the representation made on January 21, secondly, had that
representation, owing to the change of circumstances to which the Master of the
Rolls has referred, become untrue by May 1 when the contract was entered into?
The representation was this. It was made originally by Dr O’Flanagan’s agent and
subsequently confirmed by Dr O’Flanagan himself that the practice was doing at
the rate of 2000l. a year and he, that is Dr O’Flanagan, was asking 4000l. for it,
that is to say, two years’ purchase. The reference to two years’ purchase makes it
plain to me that the statement that the practice was doing at the rate of 2000l. a
year was intended to be a statement as to an essential feature of the practice, that
is to say, a representation to the proposing purchasers that if they bought the
practice they would be buying what might properly be called a 2000l. a year
practice. Had that statement become untrue by May 1? It appears to me plainly it
had. It is stated by Dr Stern, who was the locum tenens during the last of the three
periods that Dr O’Flanagan was unwell, that he only took on an average 5l. a week
during three weeks and, as the Master of the Rolls pointed out, of that 15l., 10l.
was received from one patient …
Clauson J
 
concurred.
Commentary
There are two possible bases for this decision. The first is that there was a continuing
representation by the defendant and the second is that the defendant was subject to a
duty to communicate to the plaintiffs the change of circumstances. In any event the
principle only comes into play when the maker of the initial representation has
knowledge of the fact that his representation has been falsified by later events. The
1.

(d)
principle laid down in 
With
 
was one of the elements relied upon by the Court of Appeal
in 
Spice Girls
 
in concluding that a misrepresentation had been made on the facts of that
case.
The cases examined in this section can either be explained as cases of actual
misrepresentation, or as cases in which there is a duty to disclose certain facts by reason
of the facts actually stated. It can be argued that they do not go far enough, particularly
in cases where it is alleged that the defendant has been fraudulent. In 
HIH Casualty and
General Insurance Ltd
 
v. 
Chase Manhattan Bank
 
[2001] EWCA Civ 1250, [2001] 2
Lloyd’s Rep 483 Rix LJ stated (at [48]):
The general rule is that mere non-disclosure does not constitute misrepresentation, and that in the absence of a
duty to speak there can be no liability in fraud, however dishonest the silence. However, in certain
circumstances a combination of silence together with a positive representation may itself create a
misrepresentation. Such a situation may be called partial non-disclosure, and such cases may be explained as
either instances of actual misrepresentation or as cases where a duty to speak arises. …
In terms of policy the problematic sentence is the first one. While some judges have
inclined to the view that a remedy in damages may be available in a case of ‘dishonest’
non-disclosure (see, for example, 
Conlon
 
v. 
Simms
 
[2006] EWCA Civ 1749, [2008] 1
WLR 428), the orthodox view is that no such remedy is available in a case of pure non-
disclosure. Should English law continue to hold that silence cannot amount to a
misrepresentation, even when the silence is ‘dishonest’? Article 4:107 of the Principles of
European Contract Law states:
Article 4:107—Fraud
A party may avoid a contract when it has been led to conclude it by the other party’s fraudulent
representation, whether by words or conduct, or fraudulent non-disclosure of any information which in
accordance with good faith and fair dealing it should have disclosed.
A party’s representation or non-disclosure is fraudulent if it was intended to deceive.
In determining whether good faith and fair dealing required that a party disclose particular information,
regard should be had to all the circumstances, including:
whether the party had special expertise;
the cost to it of acquiring the relevant information;
whether the other party could reasonably acquire the information for itself; and
the apparent importance of the information to the other party.
Should English law adopt such a provision?
17.4
 
Rescission
17.4.1
 
What Is Rescission and When Is it
Available?
Rescission is a remedy that is available in principle for all types of misrepresentation;
that is to say it is available whether the misrepresentation made was fraudulent,
negligent, or innocent. A contract which is rescinded for misrepresentation is set aside
for all purposes. It is set aside both retrospectively and prospectively with the aim of
restoring the parties, 
as far as possible, to the position which they were in before they
entered into the contract. Rescission is a potent remedy and its availability in cases of
innocent misrepresentation can seem harsh. Its potential harshness is demonstrated by
the following case:
REDGRAVE V. HURD
(1881) 20 Ch D 1, Court of Appeal
Redgrave was an elderly solicitor due to retire. He placed an advertisement in the
Law Times
 
seeking a successor to his practice who would buy his house for
£1,600. Hurd answered the advertisement. At a meeting Redgrave stated that the
business brought in about £300 a year. Hurd asked for information about the
amount of business done for the last three years. At a second meeting Redgrave
provided papers showing business of not quite £200 a year. When Hurd asked
how the difference was made up, Redgrave showed him further papers which he
said related to other business. Hurd did not examine the further papers which
actually showed only a small amount of business. In fact the gross returns of the
business were only about £200 a year. Hurd agreed to buy Redgrave’s house for
£1,600 and paid a deposit. Redgrave refused to include any reference to the
business in the agreement. Hurd took possession of the property but on finding the
business to be ‘utterly worthless’ refused to complete. Redgrave sought specific
performance. Hurd disputed his right to specific performance and sought
rescission of the contract and damages on the ground of Redgrave’s
misrepresentations. Fry J held that Redgrave was entitled to specific performance
because Hurd, having had the opportunity to discover the truth of Redgrave’s
representations and not having done so, had not relied on them. On Hurd’s appeal
to the Court of Appeal it was held that Hurd was entitled to rescind the contract and
to the return of the deposit.
Jessel MR
As regards the rescission of a contract, there was no doubt a difference between
the rules of Courts of Equity and the rules of Courts of Common Law—a difference
which of course has now disappeared by the operation of the Judicature Act, which
makes the rules of equity prevail. According to the decisions of Courts of Equity it
was not necessary, in order to set aside a contract obtained by material false
representation, to prove that the party who obtained it knew at the time when the
representation was made that it was false. It was put in two ways, either of which
was sufficient. One way of putting the case was, ‘A man is not to be allowed to get
a benefit from a statement which he now admits to be false. He is not to be
allowed to say, for the purpose of civil jurisdiction, that when he made it he did not
know it to be false; he ought to have found that out before he made it’. The other
way of putting it was this: ‘Even assuming that moral fraud must be shewn in order
to set aside a contract, you have it where a man, having obtained a beneficial
contract by a statement which he now knows to be false, insists upon keeping that
contract. To do so is a moral delinquency: no man ought to seek to take advantage
of his own false statements’. The rule in equity was settled, and it does not matter
on which of the two grounds it was rested. As regards the rule of Common Law
there is no doubt it was not quite so wide. There were, indeed, cases in which,
even at Common Law, a contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation,
although it could not be shewn that the person making it knew the representation
to be false. They are variously stated, but I think, according to the later decisions,
the statement must have been made recklessly and without care, whether it was
true or false, and not with the belief that it was true …
There is another proposition of law of very great importance which I think it is
necessary for me to state, because, with great deference to the very learned
Judge from whom this appeal comes, I think it is not quite accurately stated in his
judgment. If a man is induced to enter into a contract by a false representation it is
not a sufficient answer to him to say, ‘If you had used due diligence you would
have found out that the statement was untrue. You had the means afforded you of
discovering its falsity, and did not choose to avail yourself of them’. … Nothing can
be plainer, I take it, on the authorities in equity than that the effect of false
representation is not got rid of on the ground that the person to whom it was made
has been guilty of negligence. One of the most familiar instances in modern times
is where men issue a prospectus in which they make false statements of the
contracts made before the formation of a company, and then say that the contracts
themselves may be inspected at the offices of the solicitors. It has always been
held that those who accepted those false statements as true were not deprived of
their remedy merely because they neglected to go and look at the contracts.
Another instance with which we are familiar is where a vendor makes a false
statement as to the contents of a lease, as, for instance, that it contains no
covenant preventing the carrying on of the trade which the purchaser is known by
the vendor to be desirous of carrying on upon the property. Although the lease
itself might be produced at the sale, or might have been open to the inspection of
the purchaser long previously to the sale, it has been repeatedly held that the
vendor cannot be allowed to say, ‘You were not entitled to give credit to my
statement’. It is not sufficient, therefore, to say that the purchaser had the
opportunity of investigating the real state of the case, but did not avail himself of
that opportunity. It has been apparently supposed by the learned Judge in the
Court below that the case of 
Attwood
 
v. 
Small
 
6 Cl & F 232 conflicts with that
proposition …
[He considered 
Attwood
 
in some detail and continued]
In no way, as it appears to me, does the decision, or any of the grounds of
decision, in 
Attwood
 
v. 
Small
, support the proposition that it is a good defence to
an action for rescission of a contract on the ground of fraud that the man who
comes to set aside the contract inquired to a certain extent, but did it carelessly
and inefficiently, and would, if he had used reasonable diligence, have discovered
the fraud.
[He then turned to the facts of the case and considered whether the defendant
relied upon the statement made by the defendant and concluded]
[T]he learned Judge came to the conclusion either that the Defendant did not
rely on the statement, or that if he did rely upon it he had shewn such negligence
as to deprive him of his title to relief from this Court. As I have already said, the
latter proposition is in my opinion not founded in law, and the former part is not
founded in fact; I think also it is not founded in law, for when a person makes a
material representation to another to induce him to enter into a contract, and the
other enters into that contract, it is not sufficient to say that the party to whom the
representation is made does not prove that he entered into the contract, relying
upon the representation. If it is a material representation calculated to induce him
to enter into the contract, it is an inference of law that he was induced by the
representation to enter into it, and in order to take away his title to be relieved from
the contract on the ground that the representation was untrue, it must be shewn
either that he had knowledge of the facts contrary to the representation, or that he
stated in terms, or shewed clearly by his conduct, that he did not rely on the
representation. If you tell a man, ‘You may enter into partnership with me, my
business is bringing in between £300 and £400 a year’, the man who makes that
representation must know that it is a material inducement to the other to enter into
the partnership, and you cannot investigate as to whether it was more or less
probable that the inducement would operate on the mind of the party to whom the
representation was made. 
Where you have neither evidence that he knew facts to
shew that the statement was untrue, or that he said or did anything to shew that he
did not actually rely upon the statement, the inference remains that he did so rely,
and the statement being a material statement, its being untrue is a sufficient
ground for rescinding the contract. For these reasons I am of opinion that the
judgment of the learned Judge must be reversed and the appeal allowed.

Lush LJJ

Commentary
Two points of significance emerge from 
Redgrave
. The first is that it demonstrates that
the availability of rescission is not confined to cases of fraudulent misrepresentation. It
extends to non-fraudulent misrepresentations (that is, misrepresentations made
negligently or innocently). In some ways this is surprising. The justification offered by
Lord Esher MR is that ‘a man is not allowed to get a benefit from a statement which he
now
 
admits to be false’ (emphasis added). The word ‘now’ is important because it
demonstrates that there need not have been knowledge of the falsity of the statement at
the time at which it was made. Should the fact that the maker of the statement
subsequently discovers that his statement was false inevitably give to the other party the
right to set aside the contract? Contrast 
Redgrave
 
with 
Hart
 
v. 
O’Connor
 
[1985] AC
1000, where the defendant was held to be entitled to hold the plaintiff to the terms of his
contract despite the fact that the plaintiff had an inadequate understanding of the
transaction into which he was entering. The Privy Council focused on the defendant’s
knowledge of the plaintiff’s capacity 
at the time of entry into
 
the contract, and not upon
the knowledge which he gained subsequent to the making of the contract. In other
words, the fact that the defendant subsequently realized that the plaintiff did not
understand the nature of the transaction into which he had entered did not give to the
plaintiff a right to set aside the contract. Should a similar principle not apply here so
that rescission is in principle available in all cases of fraudulent and negligent
misrepresentation but not in all cases of innocent misrepresentation? It can in fact be
argued that English law has now reached a very similar position by virtue of the
enactment of section 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 (on which see 
17.4.2
).
The second point to note is that the Court of Appeal held that the defendant had relied
upon the plaintiff’s misrepresentation notwithstanding the fact that he failed to take the
opportunity that was given to him to discover the truth. The defendant was held to be
entitled to set aside the contract notwithstanding his own carelessness. At the time the
defendant could not have brought a claim for damages against the plaintiff (see 
17.5
).
Today the remedy of damages is more widely available, and it is suggested that the
carelessness of the representee can be taken into account when assessing damages
(unless the misrepresentation was made fraudulently). Thus it has been argued (Atiyah’s
An Introduction to the Law of Contract
 
(6th edn, Oxford University Press, 2006), p.
257) that:
[i]t is no defence to a plea of misrepresentation to allege that the other party might have discovered the true
facts by reasonable diligence. Provided that the innocent party relied at least in part on the false statements, she
is entitled to have the contract rescinded, although she might easily have discovered the falsity of the
statements. All the same, an extreme want of due care by the representee would show that his reliance was
unreasonable. And although the courts have not recognized this as a principle, it seems to be an implicit feature
in many 
cases where relief is denied. Moreover, where the misrepresentation is being used to found a claim in
tort for damages, it seems it would today be possible to take account of contributory negligence for the purposes
of apportioning damages. Naturally the primary responsibility for a false statement must always lie with the
maker of the statement but there are some circumstances in which apportionment would be justified. Of course,
in situations where the claimant’s claim is for rescission of the contract, this alternative is not possible.
Redgrave
 
therefore demonstrates that rescission is in principle available in all cases of
misrepresentation. Rescission does not, however, occur automatically. A party who
wishes to rescind a contract for misrepresentation must take positive steps to do so. This
requires him to bring his decision to the attention of the other party and, according to
Dyson LJ in 
Islington London Borough Council
 
v. 
UCKAC
 
[2006] EWCA Civ 340,
requires him also to obtain a court order. He stated that a voidable contract continues to
exist ‘until and unless it is set aside by an order of rescission made by the court at the
instance of a party seeking to terminate it or bring it to an end’. The requirement that he
obtain a court order is unwarranted. The decision whether or not to rescind the contract
is one that resides with the parties to the contract and not with the court. The court can
validly decide whether or not a party was entitled to rescind a contract and, in this
sense, can review the decision which has been made. But the court itself does not
actually rescind the contract by virtue of the order which it makes. What matters is that
the party seeking to set aside the contract notifies the representor but the notice need
not take the form of initiating legal action to set aside the contract. In 
Redgrave
 
the
point was taken by way of defence to the plaintiff’s action for specific performance. The
general rule is that a party who wishes to rescind a contract must bring his decision to
rescind to the attention of the other party to the contract. There is one exception to this
notification requirement and that arises where the representor absconds so that it is no
longer possible for the party to whom the representation was made to communicate
with him. As the next case demonstrates, in such a case it suffices for the party wishing
to set aside the contract to take such steps as are reasonable to demonstrate that he is
setting the contract aside (usually by notice to the police or some other official or quasi-
official body).
CAR AND UNIVERSAL FINANCE CO V. CALDWELL
[1965] 1 QB 525, Court of Appeal
The defendant, Caldwell, was the owner of a Jaguar car. He sold the car to Norris
for £975 in return for a cheque for £965 and a £10 deposit. The cheque was
dishonoured the following day (13 January). The defendant immediately informed
the police and the Automobile Association what had happened. Norris
subsequently sold the car to Motobella Co Ltd, and the car then changed hands on
a number of occasions until the plaintiff bought it in all good faith. The car was later
seized by police authorities, and in interpleader proceedings, one of the issues that
arose was whether the defendant had validly rescinded the contract for the sale of
the car on 13 January. The Court of Appeal held that he had done so.
Sellers LJ
This appeal raises a primary point in the law of contract. The question has arisen
whether a contract which is voidable by one party can in any circumstances be
terminated by that party without his rescission being communicated to the other
party. Lord Denning MR has held in the circumstances of this case that there can
be rescission without communication where the seller of a motor car, who
admittedly had the right to rescind the contract of sale on the ground of fraudulent
misrepresentation, terminated the contract by an unequivocal act of election which
demonstrated clearly that he had elected to rescind it and to be no longer bound
by it. The general rule, no doubt, is that where a party is entitled to rescind a
contract and wishes to do so the contract subsists until the opposing party is
informed that the contract has been terminated. The difficulty of the seller in this
case was that, when he learnt of the fraud and, therefore, ascertained his right to
terminate the bargain, he could not without considerable delay find either the
fraudulent buyer or the car which had been sold. Such circumstances would not
appear to be so rare in transactions in motor cars (or horses in earlier days) that
they would not, it might be thought, have given rise to litigation and an authoritative
decision, but it seems that over the years the point in issue has not been decided
in any reported cases in similar or comparable circumstances …
An affirmation of a voidable contract may be established by any conduct which
unequivocally manifests an intention to affirm it by the party who has the right to
affirm or disaffirm. Communication of an acceptance of a contract after knowledge
of a fundamental breach of it by the other party or of fraud affecting it is, of course,
evidence establishing affirmation but it is not essential evidence. A party cannot
reject goods sold and delivered if he uses them after knowledge of a right to reject,
and the judgment cites a case where an instruction to a broker to re-sell was
sufficient affirmation of the contract in question even though that conduct was not
communicated. It may be said that a contract may be more readily approved and
accepted than it can be terminated where a unilateral right to affirm or disaffirm
arises. The disaffirmation or election to avoid a contract changes the relationship of
the parties and brings their respective obligations to an end, whereas an
affirmation leaves the contract effective though subject to a claim for damages for
its breach. Where a contracting party could be communicated with, and modern
facilities make communication practically world-wide and almost immediate, it
would be unlikely that a party could be held to have disaffirmed a contract unless
he went so far as to communicate his decision so to do. It would be what the other
contracting party would normally require and unless communication were made
the party’s intention to rescind would not have been unequivocally or clearly
demonstrated or made manifest. But in circumstances such as the present case,
the other contracting party, a fraudulent rogue who would know that the vendor
would want his car back as soon as he knew of the fraud, would not expect to be
communicated with as a matter of right or requirement, and would deliberately, as
here, do all he could to evade any such communication being made to him. In such
exceptional contractual circumstances, it does not seem to me appropriate to hold
that a party so acting can claim any right to have a decision to rescind
communicated to him before the contract is terminated. To hold that he could
would involve that the defrauding party, if skilful enough to keep out of the way,
could deprive the other party to the contract of his right to rescind, a right to which
he was entitled and which he would wish to exercise, as the defrauding party
would well know or at least confidently suspect. The position has to be viewed, as I
see it, between the two contracting parties involved in the particular contract in
question. That another innocent party or parties may suffer does not in my view of
the matter justify imposing on a defrauded seller 
an impossible task. He has to
establish, clearly and unequivocally, that he terminates the contract and is no
longer to be bound by it. If he cannot communicate his decision he may still satisfy
a judge or jury that he had made a final and irrevocable decision and ended the
contract. I am in agreement with Lord Denning MR who asked ‘How is a man in the
position of Caldwell ever to be able to rescind the contract when a fraudulent
person absconds as Norris did here?’ and answered that he can do so ‘ … if he at
once, on discovering the fraud, takes all possible steps to regain the goods even
though he cannot find the rogue nor communicate with him’.
Upjohn LJ
Where one party to a contract has an option unilaterally to rescind or disaffirm it by
reason of the fraud or misrepresentation of the other party, he must elect to do so
within a reasonable time, and cannot do so after he has done anything to affirm the
contract with knowledge of the facts giving rise to the option to rescind. In principle
and on authority, however, he must, in my judgment, in the ordinary course
communicate his intention to rescind to the other party. This must be so because
the other party is entitled to treat the contractual nexus as continuing until he is
made aware of the intention of the other to exercise his option to rescind. So the
intention must be communicated and an uncommunicated intention, for example,
by speaking to a third party or making a private note, will be ineffective …
Such in my view must be the general principle. Does it admit of any exception?
…
If one party, by absconding, deliberately puts it out of the power of the other to
communicate his intention to rescind which he knows the other will almost certainly
want to do, I do not think he can any longer insist on his right to be made aware of
the election to determine the contract. In these circumstances communication is a
useless formality. I think that the law must allow the innocent party to exercise his
right of rescission otherwise than by communication or repossession. To hold
otherwise would be to allow a fraudulent contracting party by his very fraud to
prevent the innocent party from exercising his undoubted right. I would hold that in
circumstances such as these the innocent party may evince his intention to
disaffirm the contract by overt means falling short of communication or
repossession.
Davies LJ
 
delivered a concurring judgment.
Commentary
The court in 
Caldwell
 
was required to carry out the familiar exercise of deciding which
of two innocent parties should bear the loss caused by the fraud of a third party. The
Court of Appeal decided that the loss should be borne by the plaintiff purchaser on the
basis that the seller had taken all reasonable steps to notify the fraudster of his decision
to rescind the contract and on the ground that the fraudster did not wish to receive any
communication from the defendant seller. A different result was reached in Scotland in
Macleod
 
v. 
Kerr
, 1965 SC 253 where the Court of Session came down on the side of the
innocent purchaser on the basis that notification given to the police by the seller did not
suffice to rescind a contract with a third party (the fraudster).
Caldwell
 
appears to be an example of rescission operating as a proprietary
restitutionary remedy in the sense that the effect of rescission was to revest ownership of
the car in Mr Caldwell.
17.4.2
 
Loss of the Right to Rescind
While the right to rescind is, in principle, available in all cases of misrepresentation, the
right can be lost in a range of circumstances. These circumstances are generally referred
to as ‘bars’ to rescission. There are a number of such ‘bars’. The first is that a claimant
cannot rescind the contract if he affirms the contract after discovering that a
misrepresentation was made to him. Secondly, the right to rescind is lost if a bona fide
third party purchaser for value acquires the goods which are the subject matter of the
contract before the contract has been set aside. This was the principle that was invoked
by the plaintiff purchaser in 
Caldwell
, discussed earlier, but his attempt to invoke the
principle failed on the ground that the defendant had validly set aside the contract
before Norris sold the car on to any bona fide third party purchaser for value. Thirdly,
the right to rescind can be lost by the lapse of a reasonable time such that it would be
inequitable in all the circumstances to grant rescission. In 
Salt
 
v. 
Stratstone Specialist
Ltd
 
[2015] EWCA Civ 745, [2015] 2 CLC 269 the claimant agreed to buy a car from the
defendant, which was described to the claimant by an employee of the defendant as a
Cadillac CTS 3.6 litre Sport Luxury car that was ‘brand new’. The car was delivered to
the claimant on 29 September 2007 and he paid £21,895 for it. It transpired that the car
was not in fact brand new because, although it had never had a registered owner, it had
been manufactured and delivered to the defendant in 2005, had been involved in a
collision, and had required various repairs. On 16 September 2008 the claimant tried to
reject the car and did not use it subsequently. The Court of Appeal held that the claimant
had not lost the right to rescind the contract. In so concluding, Roth J stated that it was
‘something of a misnomer to say that rescission may be barred by lapse of time’ and
Longmore LJ concluded that it did not seem to him that ‘lapse of time on its own can be
a bar to rescission in this case’. The words ‘on its own’ are important. This bar to
rescission would now appear to have been absorbed within the principle of laches
according to which it is ‘only the lapse of a reasonable time such that it would be
inequitable in all the circumstances to grant rescission which constitutes a bar to the
remedy’. In this respect the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Leaf
 
v. 
International
Galleries
 
[1950] 2 KB 86 may now require re-consideration. There the plaintiff
purchased a painting in 1944 after a representation had been made to him that it was
the work of John Constable. When the plaintiff attempted to sell the painting in 1949 he
was informed that the painting was not in fact a Constable. The plaintiff then returned
the painting to the defendant and sought to recover from him the £85 he had paid for it.
The Court of Appeal held that he was not entitled to rescind the contract, albeit different
reasons were given for this conclusion. Jenkins LJ relied on the lapse of time between
the purchase of the painting and the attempt to rescind the contract. This reasoning
would now appear to be incorrect. On the other hand, the lapse of time in 
Leaf
 
was
much greater than that which had elapsed in 
Salt
 
and so it is not inevitable that 
Leaf
would be decided differently today, although it would now be incumbent on the
defendant to show that it was inequitable to permit the plaintiff to rescind the contract
and recover the purchase price if it were to succeed in its attempt to resist rescission of
the contract between the parties.
The right to rescind is often said to be lost where it is impossible to restore the parties to
their pre-contractual position. There is some confusion as to the exact basis of this
requirement. Is it the case that it must be possible to restore both parties to their pre-
contractual position or is the case that a claimant can obtain rescission provided that he
makes restitution to the defendant for any benefit which he has obtained under the
contract? The use of the phrase ‘
restitutio in integrum
’ suggests that the aim is to
restore the parties to their pre-contractual position but it is suggested that the case-law
is in fact consistent with the latter 
rationale: that is to say the concern of the courts is to
ensure that the claimant is not unjustly enriched as a result of rescission. For example, a
claimant cannot get back the purchase price he has paid for the goods and keep the
goods themselves. He must return the goods and may also have to make an allowance to
the vendor for the use that he has made of the goods. But a defendant cannot resist
rescission on the basis that he has suffered a loss which cannot be made good so that he
cannot be restored to his pre-contractual position (
McKenzie
 
v. 
Royal Bank of Canada
[1934] AC 468). The aim is therefore to prevent the unjust enrichment of the claimant
and not to restore both parties to the position they were in before the contract was
concluded (
Halpern
 
v. 
Halpern (No 2)
 
[2007] EWCA Civ 291, [2008] QB 195).
The common law took an extremely restrictive view of the right of the claimant to
rescind the contract. In order to be able to rescind the contract the claimant had to be
able to restore to the defendant the very benefit which he had obtained from the
defendant. In 
Clarke
 
v. 
Dickson
 
(1858) EB & E 148 Crompton J stated:
The plaintiff must rescind the contract in toto or not at all; he cannot both keep the shares and recover the
whole price. That is founded on the plainest principles of justice. If he cannot return the article he must keep it,
and sue for his real damage in an action on the deceit. Take the case I put in argument, of a butcher buying live
cattle, killing them, and even selling the meat to his customers. If the rule of law were as the plaintiff contends,
that butcher might, upon discovering a fraud on the part of the grazier who sold him the cattle, rescind the
contract and get back the whole price: but how could that be consistently with justice? The true doctrine is, that
a party can never repudiate a contract after, by his own act, it has become out of his power to restore the parties
to their original condition.
A more flexible approach was taken in equity and that approach has prevailed. In
Erlanger
 
v. 
New Sombrero Phosphate Co
 
(1878) 3 App Cas 1218 the defendants, who
were promoters of the plaintiff company, sold a phosphate mine to the plaintiff for
£110,000. After it had worked the mine for a period of time, the plaintiff sought to
rescind the contract of sale on the ground that the defendants had breached the
fiduciary duty which they owed to the plaintiff by failing to disclose that they had bought
the mine for £55,000 a few days before the sale to the plaintiff. The defendants
submitted that the plaintiff was not entitled to rescission because the parties could not
be restored to their pre-contractual position. It was held that the plaintiff was entitled to
rescind the contract and recover the purchase price on terms of giving up possession of
the mine and accounting to the defendants for any profits made from working the mine.
Lord Blackburn stated (at pp. 1278–1279):
It would be obviously unjust that a person who has been in possession of property under the contract which he
seeks to repudiate should be allowed to throw that back on the other party’s hands without accounting for any
benefit he may have derived from the use of the property, or if the property, though not destroyed, has been in
the interval deteriorated, without making compensation for that deterioration. But as a Court of Law has no
machinery at its command for taking an account of such matters, the defrauded party, if he sought his remedy
at law, must in such cases keep the property and sue in an action for deceit, in which the jury, if properly
directed, can do complete justice by giving as damages a full indemnity for all that the party has lost: see 
Clarke
v. 
Dixon
 
EB & E 148 and the cases there cited.
But a Court of Equity could not give damages, and, unless it can rescind the contract, can give no relief. And,
on the other hand, it can take accounts of profits, and make allowance for 
deterioration. And I think the practice
has always been for a Court of Equity to give this relief whenever, by the exercise of its powers, it can do what is
practically just, though it cannot restore the parties precisely to the state they were in before the contract. And a
Court of Equity requires that those who come to it to ask its active interposition to give them relief, should use
due diligence, after there has been such notice or knowledge as to make it inequitable to lie by. And any change
which occurs in the position of the parties or the state of the property after such notice or knowledge should tell
much more against the party 
in morâ
, than a similar change before he was 
in morâ
 
should do.
The key phrase here is ‘practical justice’ (see also 
Spence
 
v. 
Crawford
 
[1939] 3 All ER
271) and the principal issue is the extent to which the courts are willing to allow a party
who wishes to rescind a contract to offer a money allowance for the benefit that he
cannot physically give back. The greater the willingness of the court to allow the
claimant to make a money payment in this way, the less significant this barrier to
rescission will become. In 
Salt
 
v. 
Stratstone Specialist Ltd
 
[2015] EWCA Civ 745, [2015]
2 CLC 269 the Court of Appeal affirmed that the courts do enjoy a considerable degree
of flexibility when deciding whether or not it is possible to restore the parties to their
pre-contract position. The emphasis was placed on the need to achieve a ‘practically just’
outcome and, to this end, where it is impossible physically to restore the parties (or the
subject matter of their contract) to the pre-contract position, the court should consider
whether a monetary award can restore the parties in substance to that position. On this
basis this barrier to rescission is likely to reduce significantly. As Longmore LJ observed,
rescission will in future be prima facie available if ‘practical justice’ can be done as
between the parties. Further, if ‘practical justice’ requires a representor to be
compensated for depreciation, it is for the representor to so assert and prove its
entitlement to compensation and the same principle applies where the representor
asserts that account should be taken of use made by the representee of the subject
matter of the contract.
The final circumstance in which the right to rescind may be lost is where the court
exercises its discretion under section 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 to award
the claimant damages in lieu of rescission. At this point it is important to remember that
rescission is an attractive remedy for a claimant who has entered into a bad bargain
because it provides him with an exit route from his contract. This may be very harsh on
a defendant, particularly a defendant who has made an innocent misrepresentation.
Section 2(2) can come to the aid of such a defendant by confining the claimant to a
remedy in damages. We shall return to the basis upon which the courts assess damages
under section 2(2) at a later stage (see 
17.5.4
). Here our concern is with the basis upon
which the court will exercise its discretion not to grant rescission and to confine the
claimant to a remedy in damages. Section 2(2) provides:
[W]here a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him otherwise than
fraudulently, and he would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract, then, if it is
claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract, that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded, the
court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, if of the opinion
that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would
be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party.
An example of the willingness of the court to use section 2(2) in order to stop a claimant
escaping from a bad bargain is provided by the following case:
WILLIAM SINDALL PLC V. CAMBRIDGESHIRE COUNTY
COUNCIL
[1994] 1 WLR 1016, Court of Appeal
In December 1988 William Sindall plc agreed to buy development land from
Cambridgeshire County Council for £5,082,500. Before the sale was completed,
Sindall made various inquiries of the council regarding rights of easement and
other public rights affecting the land. The council replied on a standard form stating
that, so far as it was aware, there were no rights of easement or public rights
affecting the property other than those disclosed in the contract. The sale was
completed in March 1989. In October 1989 Sindall discovered a private foul sewer
which had been built on the land in 1970. They alleged that the existence of this
foul sewer meant that the council had made a misrepresentation when they stated
that there were no such matters affecting the site. By this time the value of the land
had halved so Sindall brought an action for a declaration that the contract had
been rescinded and for repayment of the purchase price. The judge granted the
declaration. On appeal the court held that there had been no misrepresentation by
the council, negligent or otherwise, but if there had been any misrepresentation,
damages would be awarded under section 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967
in lieu of rescission.
Hoffmann LJ
[Having concluded that no misrepresentation had been made nevertheless turned
to consider section 2(2) of the Act]
6.
 
Discretion
My conclusion that there are no grounds for rescission, either for
misrepresentation or mistake, mean that it is unnecessary to consider whether the
judge correctly exercised his discretion under section 2(2) of the Misrepresentation
Act 1967 not to award damages in lieu of rescission. But in case this case goes
further, I should say that in my judgment the judge approached this question on a
false basis, arising from his mistake about the seriousness of the defect. This
vitiated the exercise of the discretion and would have made it necessary, if we
thought that Sindall would otherwise have been entitled to rescind for
misrepresentation, to exercise our own discretion under section 2(2) …
[He set out section 2(2) and continued]
This provision was adopted as a result of the Tenth Report of the Law Reform
Committee (1962) (Cmnd. 1782) which also recommended abolishing the bar on
rescission after completion. The relevant paragraphs of the report were 11 and 12:
‘11. A more fundamental objection which may be advanced against our recommendation [to abolish the
bar on rescission after completion] concerns the drastic character of the remedy to which the plaintiff
would be entitled. Unless the court’s power to grant rescission is made more elastic than it is at present,
the court will not be able to take account 
of the relative importance or unimportance of the facts which
have been misrepresented. A car might be returned to the vendor because of a misrepresentation about
the mileage done since the engine was last overhauled, or a transfer of shares rescinded on account of
an incorrect statement about the right to receive the current dividend. In some cases the result could be
as harsh on the representor as the absence of a right to rescind under the current law can be on the
representee. Moreover, the conflict between remedies for misrepresentation and those for breach of
contract would be aggravated. There is already the anomaly that a statement embodied in the contract
and constituting a minor term of it is treated as a warranty, the breach of which gives only a right to
damages, whereas the same statement as a representation inducing the contract enables the latter to be
rescinded. Before the contract is executed and at a time when the parties can be relatively easily
restored to their original positions, this anomaly may not matter very much, but the position would be
different if the court had no option but to order rescission after the contract had been executed.
12. To meet these objections we recommend that wherever the court has power to order rescission it
should, as an alternative, have a discretionary power to award damages if it is satisfied that these would
afford adequate compensation to the plaintiff, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and
the fact that the injury suffered by the plaintiff is small compared with what rescission would involve. The
courts were given power to award damages in addition to or in substitution for an injunction or a decree
of specific performance by section 2 of Lord Cairns’s Act (the Chancery Procedure Amendment Act
1858), and since the decision of the House of Lords in 
Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society Ltd
 
v. 
Slack
[1924] AC 851, the power has been exercised on principles similar to those we have just mentioned.’
The discretion conferred by section 2(2) is a broad one, to do what is equitable.
But there are three matters to which the court must in particular have regard.
The first is the nature of the misrepresentation. It is clear from the Law Reform
Committee’s report that the court was meant to consider the importance of the
representation in relation to the subject matter of the transaction. I have already
said that in my view, in the context of a £5m. sale of land, a misrepresentation
which would have cost £18,000 to put right and was unlikely seriously to have
interfered with the development or resale of the property was a matter of relatively
minor importance.
The second matter to which the court must have regard is ‘the loss that would
be caused by [the misrepresentation] if the contract were upheld’. The section
speaks in terms of loss suffered rather than damages recoverable but clearly
contemplates that if the contract is upheld, such loss will be compensated by an
award of damages …
[He then considered the basis on which the court is to award damages under
section 2(2), on which see 
17.5.4
]
The third matter to be taken into account under section 2(2) is the loss which
would be caused to Cambridgeshire by rescission …
Having regard to these matters, and in particular the gross disparity between
the loss which would be caused to Sindall by the misrepresentation and the loss
which would be caused to Cambridgeshire by rescission, I would have exercised
my discretion to award damages in lieu of rescission.
Evans LJ
 
delivered a concurring judgment. 
Russell LJ
 
concurred.
Commentary
This case is an excellent example of a court being willing to use its discretion under
section 2(2) to relegate a claimant to an award of damages. Hoffmann LJ identifies and
applies the three factors identified as relevant by section 2(2), while at the same time
emphasizing that the discretion given to the court under section 2(2) is a broad one. As
we shall see (
17.5.4
), there are difficulties in discerning the basis on which damages are
to be awarded under section 2(2). Nevertheless, section 2(2) is a useful provision in so
far as it enables a court to do what the Court of Appeal did on the facts of this case,
namely block an attempt to use an innocent misrepresentation as a pretext to get out of
what has become a bad bargain.
17.5
 
Damages
Until relatively recently only a fraudulent misrepresentation gave rise to an action for
damages. This point has to be borne in mind when reading cases pre-1963. Prior to the
decision of the House of Lords in 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Heller & Partners Ltd
[1964] AC 465 the courts could not award damages for a negligent or an innocent
misrepresentation. In these circumstances courts were sometimes tempted to find that
what seemed to be a mere representation was in fact a term of a collateral contract so
that a deserving plaintiff had a claim for damages for breach of contract (
De Lassalle
 
v.
Guildford
 
[1901] 2 KB 215, 
8.3
). The need for such subterfuge has gone. Parliament has
now created a right to damages under section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967
and the right so created is an extraordinarily generous one. We shall therefore start with
the right to damages created by the Act before turning to other alternatives open to a
claimant who wishes to recover damages in respect of a misrepresentation made by the
defendant.
17.5.1
 
Section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act
1967
Section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 provides:
Where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party
thereto and as a result thereof he has suffered loss then, if the person making the misrepresentation would be
liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently, that person shall be so
liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently, unless he proves that he had
reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time that the contract was made that the facts
represented were true.
This subsection has been stated to create ‘a statutory tort’ (
First Tower Trustees Ltd
 
v.
CDS (Superstores International) Ltd
 
[2018] EWCA Civ 1396, [2019] 1 WLR 637, [98]).
It creates a right of action for damages where the misrepresentation has been made by
the other party to the contract. Where the misrepresentation has been made by a third
party, the claimant cannot rely upon section 2(1) but must bring his claim in tort. But in
the case where the 
misrepresentation has been made by the other party to the contract,
then section 2(1) is the obvious remedy for a claimant who wishes to recover damages.
The advantages that can be obtained through an action for damages under section 2(1)
are illustrated by the following two cases:
ROYSCOT TRUST LTD V. ROGERSON
[1991] 2 QB 297, Court of Appeal
In May 1987 Maidenhead Honda Centre Ltd, a car dealer, agreed to sell to
Rogerson a car on hire-purchase terms for £7,600, £1,200 of which was payable
as a deposit. Royscot Trust Ltd, a finance company, agreed to purchase the car
from Maidenhead and to enter into a hire-purchase agreement with Rogerson. In
its proposal to Royscot, Maidenhead innocently misrepresented the purchase price
as £8,000 and the deposit as £1,600. Royscot had a policy of not entering into
hire-purchase agreements unless the deposit was at least 20 per cent of the
purchase price, and on the basis of Maidenhead’s misrepresentations, agreed to
pay Maidenhead £6,400 for the car. Rogerson paid some of the outstanding
instalments to Royscot but in August 1987 dishonestly sold the car. Rogerson
informed Royscot of the sale in August 1988 and stopped making instalment
payments in September 1988. Royscot brought an action against Maidenhead for
damages for misrepresentation under section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act
1967. The trial judge awarded damages of £1,600 for the difference between the
amount paid by Royscot to Maidenhead (£6,400) and the amount Royscot would
have paid to Maidenhead if the deposit of £1,200 had been 20 per cent of the
purchase price (£4,800). The Court of Appeal awarded damages of £3,625.24 for
the difference between the amount paid by Royscot to Maidenhead (£6,400) and
the amount paid by Rogerson to Royscot (£2,774.76).
Balcombe LJ
[set out the facts and continued]
So I turn to the issue on this appeal which the dealer submits raises a pure
point of law: where (a) a motor dealer innocently misrepresents to a finance
company the amount of the sale price of, and the deposit paid by the intended
purchaser of, the car, and (b) the finance company is thereby induced to enter into
a hire-purchase agreement with the purchaser which it would not have done if it
had known the true facts, and (c) the purchaser thereafter dishonestly disposes of
the car and defaults on the hire-purchase agreement, can the finance company
recover all or part of its losses on the hire-purchase agreement from the motor
dealer?
The finance company’s cause of action against the dealer is based on section
2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 which reads:
[He set out the terms of the subsection and continued]
As a result of some dicta by Lord Denning MR in two cases in the Court of
Appeal—
Gosling
 
v. 
Anderson
 
[1972] EGD 709 and 
Jarvis
 
v. 
Swan Tours Ltd
 
[1973]
QB 233, 237—and the decision at first instance in 
Watts
 
v. 
Spence
 
[1976] Ch 165,
there was some doubt whether the measure of damages for an innocent
misrepresentation giving rise to a cause of action under the Act of 1967 was the
tortious measure, so as to put the representee in the position in which he would
have been if he had never entered into the contract, or the contractual measure, so
as to put the representee in the position in which he would have been if the
misrepresentation had been true, and thus in some cases give rise to a claim for
damages for 
loss of bargain. Lord Denning MR’s remarks in 
Gosling
 
v. 
Anderson
were concerned with an amendment to a pleading, while his remarks in 
Jarvis
 
v.
Swan Tours Ltd
 
were clearly obiter. 
Watts
 
v. 
Spence
 
was disapproved by this court
in 
Sharneyford Supplies Ltd
 
v. 
Edge
 
[1987] Ch 305, 323. However, there is now a
number of decisions which make it clear that the tortious measure of damages is
the true one. … One at least, 
Chesneau
 
v. 
Interhome Ltd
 
(1983) 134 NLJ 341;
Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No 238 of 1983, is a decision of this
court. The claim was one under section 2(1) of the Act of 1967 and the appeal
concerned the assessment of damages. In the course of his judgment Eveleigh LJ
said:
‘[Damages] should be assessed in a case like the present one on the same principles as damages are
assessed in tort. The subsection itself says: “if the person making the misrepresentation would be liable
to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently, that person shall be so
liable …” By “so liable” I take it to mean liable as he would be if the misrepresentation had been made
fraudulently.’
In view of the wording of the subsection it is difficult to see how the measure of
damages under it could be other than the tortious measure and, despite the initial
aberrations referred to above, that is now generally accepted. Indeed counsel
before us did not seek to argue the contrary.
The first main issue before us was: accepting that the tortious measure is the
right measure, is it the measure where the tort is that of fraudulent
misrepresentation, or is it the measure where the tort is negligence at common
law? The difference is that in cases of fraud a plaintiff is entitled to any loss which
flowed from the defendant’s fraud, even if the loss could not have been foreseen:
see 
Doyle
 
v. 
Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd
 
[1969] 2 QB 158. In my judgment the wording
of the subsection is clear: the person making the innocent misrepresentation shall
be ‘so liable’, i.e., liable to damages as if the representation had been made
fraudulently. This was the conclusion to which Walton J came in 
F & B
Entertainments Ltd
 
v. 
Leisure Enterprises Ltd
 
(1976) 240 EG 455, 461. See also
the decision of Sir Douglas Frank QC, sitting as a High Court judge, in 
McNally
 
v.
Welltrade International Ltd
 
[1978] IRLR 497. In each of these cases the judge held
that the basis for the assessment of damages under section 2(1) of the Act of 1967
is that established in 
Doyle
 
v. 
Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd
. This is also the effect of the
judgment of Eveleigh LJ in 
Chesneau
 
v. 
Interhome Ltd
 
already cited: ‘By “so liable”
I take it to mean liable as he would be if the misrepresentation had been made
fraudulently’.
This was also the original view of the academic writers. In an article, ‘The
Misrepresentation Act 1967’ (1967) 30 
MLR
 
369 by P.S. Atiyah and G.H. Treitel,
the authors say, at pp. 373–374:
‘The measure of damages in the statutory action will apparently be that in an action of deceit. … But
more probably the damages recoverable in the new action are the same as those recoverable in an
action of deceit … ’
Professor Treitel has since changed his view. In Treitel, 
The Law of Contract
, 7th
ed. (1987), p. 278, he says:
‘Where the action is brought under section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, one possible view is
that the deceit rule will be applied by virtue of the fiction of fraud. But the preferable view is that the
severity of the deceit rule can only be justified in cases of actual fraud and that remoteness under
section 2(1) should depend, as in actions based on negligence, on the test of foreseeability.’
The only authority cited in support of the ‘preferable’ view is 
Shepheard
 
v. 
Broome
[1904] AC 342, a case under section 38 of the Companies Act 1867, which
provided that in certain 
circumstances a company director, although not in fact
fraudulent, should be ‘deemed to be fraudulent’. As Lord Lindley said, at p. 346: ‘To
be compelled by Act of Parliament to treat an honest man as if he were fraudulent
is at all times painful’, but he went on to say:
‘but the repugnance which is naturally felt against being compelled to do so will not justify your Lordships
in refusing to hold the appellant responsible for acts for which an Act of Parliament clearly declares he is
to be held liable.’
The House of Lords so held.
It seems to me that that case, far from supporting Professor Treitel’s view, is
authority for the proposition that we must follow the literal wording of section 2(1),
even though that has the effect of treating, so far as the measure of damages is
concerned, an innocent person as if he were fraudulent. 
Chitty on Contracts
, 26th
edn. (1989), vol. 1, p. 293, para 439, says:
‘[I]t is doubtful whether the rule that the plaintiff may recover even unforeseeable losses suffered as the
result of fraud would be applied; it is an exceptional rule which is probably justified only in cases of
actual fraud.’
No authority is cited in support of that proposition save a reference to the passage
in Professor Treitel’s book cited above.
Professor Furmston in 
Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s Law of Contract
, 11th
ed. (1986), p. 286, says:
‘“It has been suggested”—and the reference is to the passage in Atiyah and Treitel’s article cited above
—“that damages under section 2(1) should be calculated on the same principles as govern the tort of
deceit”. This suggestion is based on a theory that section 2(1) is based on a “fiction of fraud”. We have
already suggested that this theory is misconceived. On the other hand the action created by section 2(1)
does look much more like an action in tort than one in contract and it is suggested that the rules for
negligence are the natural ones to apply.’
The suggestion that the ‘fiction of fraud’ theory is misconceived occurs at p. 271, in
a passage which includes:
‘Though it would be quixotic to defend the drafting of the section, it is suggested that there is no such
“fiction of fraud” since the section does not say that a negligent misrepresentor shall be treated for all
purposes as if he were fraudulent. No doubt the wording seeks to incorporate by reference some of the
rules relating to fraud but, for instance, nothing in the wording of the subsection requires the measure of
damages for deceit to be applied to the statutory action.’
With all respect to the various learned authors whose works I have cited above, it
seems to me that to suggest that a different measure of damage applies to an
action for innocent misrepresentation under the section than that which applies to
an action for fraudulent misrepresentation (deceit) at common law is to ignore the
plain words of the subsection and is inconsistent with the cases to which I have
referred. In my judgment, therefore, the finance company is entitled to recover from
the dealer all the losses which it suffered as a result of its entering into the
agreements with the dealer and the customer, even if those losses were
unforeseeable, provided that they were not otherwise too remote.
[Balcombe LJ went on to consider whether Rogerson’s wrongful sale of the car
was a 
novus actus interveniens
 
breaking the chain of causation between
Maidenhead’s innocent misrepresentations and Royscot’s loss. He held that the
reasonable foreseeability of the sale was relevant to this issue and that, as the
sale was reasonably foreseeable, it was not a 
novus actus interveniens
.]
Ralph Gibson LJ
 
delivered a concurring judgment.
Commentary
This is an extraordinary decision because its effect is to require a defendant who may
not even have been negligent (in the sense that the claimant is not required to prove that
the defendant had been negligent in order to recover damages under section 2(1)) to pay
damages as if he had been fraudulent. The justification offered for this conclusion is the
reference to ‘fraud’ in section 2(1). The reference had been known as the ‘fiction of fraud’
but the Court of Appeal held that it was no fiction as far as defendants are concerned
because it requires them to pay damages on the basis that the claim brought against
them is one for fraud. As Professor Hooley has pointed out (‘Damages and the
Misrepresentation Act 1967’ (1991) 107 
LQR
 
547, 549), the ‘effect of the Court of
Appeal’s decision is to treat the foolish but honest man as if he were dishonest’. In 
Smith
New Court Securities Ltd
 
v. 
Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd
 
[1997] AC
254, 283 Lord Steyn stated:
The question is whether the rather loose wording of the statute compels the court to treat a person who was
morally innocent as if he was guilty of fraud when it comes to the measure of damages. There has been
trenchant academic criticism of the 
Royscot
 
case [he refers to the article by Richard Hooley]. Since this point
does not directly arise in the present case, I express no concluded view on the correctness of the decision in the
Royscot
 
case.
The decision in 
Royscot
 
can be attacked on the ground that judges in other cases have
not given so much weight to the ‘fiction of fraud’. This can be seen in 
Gran Gelato Ltd
 
v.
Richcliff (Group) Ltd
 
[1992] Ch 560 where Sir Donald Nicholls V-C, in considering
whether the defence of contributory negligence was available in a case brought under
section 2(1), stated (at p. 573):
[I]n short, liability under the 1967 Act is essentially founded on negligence, in the sense that the defendant, the
representor, did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true. (Of course, if he
did not so believe the facts represented were true he will be liable for fraud.) This being so, it would be very odd
if the defence of contributory negligence were not available to a claim under that Act. It would be very odd if
contributory negligence were available as a defence to a claim for damages based on a breach of a duty to take
care in and about the making of a particular representation, but not available to a claim for damages under the
1967 Act in respect of the same representation.
The interesting point here is that the analogy is drawn with the tort of negligence (see to
the same effect 
Taberna Europe CDO II plc
 
v. 
Selskabet AF1 (formerly Roskilde Bank
A/S)
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 1262, [2017] QB 633, [52]) and not with the tort of deceit (where
contributory negligence is not available as a defence: see 
Standard Chartered Bank
 
v.
Pakistan National Shipping Corporation
 
[2002] UKHL 43, [2003] 1 AC 959). Why is it
that the analogy is drawn with the tort of deceit when fixing the measure of recovery, but
that the analogy is drawn with the tort of negligence when considering the defences that
are available to the claim brought by the claimant? The law presently lacks coherence
and, as Hamblen J observed, there is a ‘real possibility’ that 
Royscot
 
will be reversed
when the issue is at some future time considered by the Supreme Court (
Cheltenham
Borough Council
 
v. 
Laird
 
[2009] EWHC 1253 (QB), [2009] IRLR 621, [524]). But we
have not yet reached that point and it should be noted that Lord Steyn in 
Smith New
Court Securities
 
refrained from expressing a 
‘concluded view’ on the correctness of the
decision. This being the case, 
Royscot
 
currently remains good law and it is a decision
that is binding on the Court of Appeal and lower courts (see the reluctant acceptance of
this point by Leggatt J in 
Yam Seng Pte Ltd
 
v. 
International Trade Corporation Ltd
[2013] EWHC 111 (QB), [2013] 1 All ER (Comm) 321, [206]).
The primary significance of 
Royscot
 
lies, not so much in the measure of recovery, but in
the remoteness rule applicable. It is agreed that the basic measure of recovery in a claim
brought under section 2(1) should aim to put the claimant in the position he would have
been in had the representation not been made. This reflects the basic measure of
recovery in both the tort of deceit and the tort of negligence. When assessing damages it
is relevant to consider what, if any, other transaction the claimant would have entered
into if the misrepresentation had not been made (
Yam Seng Pte Ltd
 
v. 
International
Trade Corporation Ltd
 
[2013] EWHC 111 (QB), [2013] 1 All ER (Comm) 321, [217]). It is
principally in the context of the remoteness rules that the differences become apparent.
In negligence the remoteness test is based on the reasonable foreseeability of the kind of
harm suffered by the claimant (see 
The Wagon Mound (No 1)
 
[1961] AC 388), whereas
in deceit the defendant is liable for all losses which flow directly from the representation
whether or not they were reasonably foreseeable (
Smith New Court Securities Ltd
 
v.
Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd
 
[1997] AC 254). 
Royscot
 
almost renders
the tort of deceit a dead letter in relation to a claimant who can bring his claim within
the fold of section 2(1). Why should a claimant take on the arduous task of proving that
a defendant was fraudulent when he can recover exactly the same amount of money by
way of damages under section 2(1) by simply proving that the misrepresentation was
made by the other party to the contract? Once he has demonstrated that a
misrepresentation has been made he can collect damages on the basis that the
defendant has been fraudulent unless the defendant can show that he had reasonable
grounds to believe, and did believe, that his statement was true. As the next case
demonstrates, it is no easy task for a defendant to discharge this burden.
HOWARD MARINE AND DREDGING CO LTD V. A OGDEN
& SONS (EXCAVATIONS) LTD
[1978] QB 574, Court of Appeal
The plaintiffs, Howard Marine and Dredging Co Ltd, owned two sea-going barges.
The defendants, A Ogden & Sons (Excavations) Ltd, were contractors who wanted
to hire the barges to carry clay out to sea for dumping. In negotiations for the hire
of the barges an employee of Howard, O’Loughlin, told Ogden that the capacity of
each barge was 850 cubic metres which was equivalent to ‘about 1,600 tonnes
deadweight carrying capacity, subject to weather, fuel load and time of year’.
O’Loughlin based that figure on an entry in the Lloyd’s Register. However, there
was a mistake in the Register and the correct figure for deadweight capacity was
only 1,055 tonnes. The correct figure was stated in the ship’s documents in
Howard’s possession. A charterparty containing an exclusion clause was agreed
by Howard and Ogden but never signed. Ogden took delivery of the barges and
used them for about six months. When Ogden discovered that the deadweight
capacity of the barges was only 1,055 tonnes, they refused to pay the full amount
for hire. Howard brought an action to recover the outstanding hire charges. Ogden
counterclaimed for damages. Four issues arose at trial: (i) whether O’Loughlin’s
statement as to deadweight capacity was a collateral warranty which Howard had
breached, (ii) whether O’Loughlin’s statement breached a common law duty of
care owed by Howard to Ogden, (iii) whether O’Loughlin’s statement was a
misrepresentation for which Howard was liable under section 2(1) of the
Misrepresentation Act 1967, and (iv) the effect of the exclusion clause. The trial
judge held that Ogden were liable to pay for the hire of the barges. Ogden
appealed to the Court of Appeal who, by a majority, allowed their appeal.
In the Court of Appeal all three judges held on the first issue that there was
nothing in the pre-contractual negotiations which could amount to a collateral
warranty. On the second issue Shaw LJ held that Howard were liable in negligence
at common law as the nature of the transaction imposed on them a duty of care in
giving information on matters peculiarly within their knowledge. Lord Denning MR
held that Howard were under no duty of care at common law. Bridge LJ doubted
whether Howard were under a duty of care at common law and, if they were,
whether they had breached the duty, but expressed no concluded view. On the
third issue Bridge and Shaw LJJ held that Howard were liable to Ogden for
O’Loughlin’s misrepresentation and had not discharged the burden in section 2(1)
of the Act of 1967 of proving that O’Loughlin had a reasonable ground for believing
that his representation was true. Lord Denning MR held that Howard had
discharged the burden contained in section 2(1). On the fourth issue Bridge and
Shaw LJJ held that Howard could not escape liability by reliance on the exclusion
clause. The clause was a provision which would ‘exclude or restrict … any liability
to which a party to a contract might be subject by reason of any misrepresentation
made by him’ within section 3 of the Act of 1967, and it was not ‘fair and
reasonable’ to allow Howard to rely on it. Accordingly, the clause was of no effect.
Lord Denning MR held that it was ‘fair and reasonable’ to allow Howard to rely on
the exclusion clause as the parties were of equal bargaining power, and Ogden
could easily have obtained advice that the barges were not fit for their purposes
before concluding the contract. The extracts below concern only the second and
third issues.
Lord Denning MR
[dissenting]
[Having concluded that Howard did not owe a duty of care at common law, he
turned to consider Howard’s liability under section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act
1967]
This enactment imposes a new and serious liability on anyone who makes a
representation of fact in the course of negotiations for a contract. If that
representation turns out to be mistaken—then however innocent he may be—he is
just as liable as if he made it fraudulently. But how different from times past! For
years he was not liable in damages at all for innocent misrepresentation: see
Heilbut, Symons & Co
 
v. 
Buckleton
 
[1913] AC 30. Quite recently he was made
liable if he was proved to have made it negligently: see 
Esso Petroleum Co Ltd
 
v.
Mardon
 
[1976] QB 801. But now with this Act he is made liable—unless he proves
—and the burden is on him to prove—that he had reasonable ground to believe
and did in fact believe that it was true.
Section 2(1) certainly applies to the representation made by Mr O’Loughlin on
July 11, 1974, when he told Ogdens that each barge could carry 1,600 tonnes. The
judge found that it was a misrepresentation: that he said it with the object of getting
the hire contract for Howards. They got it: and, as a result, Ogdens suffered loss.
But the judge found that Mr O’Loughlin was not negligent: and so Howards were
not liable for it.
The judge’s finding was criticised before us: because he asked himself the
question: was Mr O’Loughlin negligent? Whereas he should have asked himself:
did Mr O’Loughlin have reasonable ground to believe that the representation was
true? I think that criticism is not fair to the judge. By the word ‘negligent’ he was
only using shorthand for the longer phrase contained in section 2(1) which he had
before him. And the judge, I am sure, had the burden of proof in mind: for he had
come to the conclusion that Mr O’Loughlin was not negligent. 
The judge said in
effect: ‘I am satisfied that Mr O’Loughlin was not negligent’: and being so satisfied,
the burden need not be further considered: see 
Robins
 
v. 
National Trust Co Ltd
[1927] AC 515, 520.
It seems to me that when one examines the details, the judge’s view was
entirely justified. He found that Mr O’Loughlin’s state of mind was this: Mr
O’Loughlin had examined Lloyd’s Register and had seen there that the deadweight
capacity of each barge was 1,800 tonnes. That figure stuck in his mind. The judge
found that ‘the 1,600 tonnes was arrived at by knocking off what he considered a
reasonable margin for fuel, and so on, from the 1,800 tonnes summer deadweight
figure in Lloyd’s Register, which was in the back of his mind’. The judge said that
Mr O’Loughlin had seen at some time the German shipping documents and had
seen the deadweight figure of 1,055.135 tonnes: but it did not register. All that was
in his mind was the 1,800 tonnes in Lloyd’s Register which was regarded in
shipping circles as the Bible. That afforded reasonable ground for him to believe
that the barges could each carry 1,600 tonnes pay load: and that is what Mr
O’Loughlin believed.
So on this point, too, I do not think we should fault the judge. It is not right to
pick his judgment to pieces—by subjecting it—or the shorthand note—to literal
analysis. Viewing it fairly, the judge (who had section 2 (1) in front of him) must
have been of opinion that the burden of proof was discharged.
Bridge LJ
… the remaining, and to my mind the more difficult, question raised in this appeal
is whether Mr O’Loughlin’s undoubted misrepresentation gives rise to any liability
in tort either under the provisions of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 or at common
law for breach of a duty of care owed to Ogdens with respect to the accuracy of
the information given. I will consider first the position under the statute.
[He set out section 2(1) of the Act and continued]
The first question then is whether Howards would be liable in damages in
respect of Mr O’Loughlin’s misrepresentation if it had been made fraudulently, that
is to say, if he had known that it was untrue. An affirmative answer to that question
is inescapable. The judge found in terms that what Mr O’Loughlin said about the
capacity of the barges was said with the object of getting the hire contract for
Howards, in other words, with the intention that it should be acted on. This was
clearly right. Equally clearly the misrepresentation was in fact acted on by Ogdens.
It follows, therefore, on the plain language of the statute that, although there was
no allegation of fraud, Howards must be liable unless they proved that Mr
O’Loughlin had reasonable ground to believe what he said about the barges’
capacity.
It is unfortunate that the judge never directed his mind to the question whether
Mr O’Loughlin had any reasonable ground for his belief. The question he asked
himself, in considering liability under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, was whether
the innocent misrepresentation was negligent. He concluded that if Mr O’Loughlin
had given the inaccurate information in the course of the April telephone
conversations he would have been negligent to do so but that in the circumstances
obtaining at the Otley interview in July there was no negligence. I take it that he
meant by this that on the earlier occasions the circumstances were such that he
would have been under a duty to check the accuracy of his information, but on the
later occasions he was exempt from any such duty. I appreciate the basis of this
distinction, but it seems to me, with respect, quite irrelevant to any question of
liability under the statute. If the representee proves a misrepresentation 
which, if
fraudulent, would have sounded in damages, the onus passes immediately to the
representor to prove that he had reasonable ground to believe the facts
represented. In other words the liability of the representor does not depend upon
his being under a duty of care the extent of which may vary according to the
circumstances in which the representation is made. In the course of negotiations
leading to a contract the statute imposes an absolute obligation not to state facts
which the representor cannot prove he had reasonable ground to believe.
[Bridge LJ considered the evidence of the grounds for O’Loughlin’s belief. He
noted the findings of the trial judge that: (i) O’Loughlin looked at the ship’s
documents and saw, but did not register, the figure of 1,055.135 tonnes; and (ii)
O’Loughlin looked up the Lloyd’s Register and saw the figure of 1,800 tonnes,
which stayed in his mind. However Bridge LJ also noted O’Loughlin’s oral evidence
at trial. In particular: (i) O’Loughlin saw and understood the figure of 1,055.135
tonnes in the ship’s documents and never said that the figure ‘did not register’ with
him; and (ii) the only explanation O’Loughlin could provide for relying on the figure
in the Lloyd’s Register rather than the figure in the ship’s documents was that the
ship’s documents stated the freshwater deadweight capacity rather than the
saltwater cubic capacity.]
I am fully alive to the dangers of trial by transcript and it is to be assumed that
Mr O’Loughlin was perfectly honest throughout. But the question remains whether
his evidence, however benevolently viewed, is sufficient to show that he had an
objectively reasonable ground to disregard the figure in the ship’s documents and
to prefer the Lloyd’s Register figure. I think it is not. The fact that he was more
interested in cubic capacity could not justify reliance on one figure of deadweight
capacity in preference to another. The fact that the deadweight figure in the ship’s
documents was a freshwater figure was of no significance since, as he knew, the
difference between freshwater and sea water deadweight capacity was minimal.
Accordingly I conclude that Howards failed to prove that Mr O’Loughlin had
reasonable ground to believe the truth of his misrepresentation to Mr Redpath.
Having reached a conclusion favourable to Ogdens on the issue of liability
under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, I do not find it necessary to express a
concluded view on the issue of negligence at common law. As at present advised I
doubt if the circumstances surrounding the misrepresentation at the Otley interview
were such as to impose on Howards a common law duty of care for the accuracy
of the statement. If there was such a duty, I doubt if the evidence established a
breach of it.
Shaw LJ
There remains the issue raised by the claim under section 2(1) of the
Misrepresentation Act 1967. I do not regard the telephone conversation of April
and the interview of July 11, 1974, as being so casual as to give rise to no legal
consequences. Certainly I find myself unable to dismiss what was said at the
interview in July as inconsequential. I share the opinion expressed in this regard in
the judgment of Bridge LJ which is based on the finding of the judge. I entirely
agree, furthermore, with Bridge LJ’s analysis of the evidence, together with the
judge’s findings in this regard, and I agree also with the views expressed by Bridge
LJ as to the operation and effect of the relevant provisions of the Misrepresentation
Act. I cannot do better than respectfully to adopt his reasoning without seeking to
repeat it, and I agree with his conclusions.
On this ground as well as in relation to the claim based on negligence at
common law I would allow the appeal.
Commentary
The competition here was between a claim under section 2(1) and a claim in the tort of
negligence (rather than, as in 
Royscot
, a competition between section 2(1) and the tort
of deceit). Once again section 2(1) emerged as the victor. The outcome of the tort claim
was inconclusive in that Shaw LJ was of the opinion it would succeed, Lord Denning was
of the view that it failed, while Bridge LJ doubted whether it would succeed. But the
defendants did succeed in their appeal under section 2(1), albeit by a majority. The case
demonstrates the significance of the shift in the onus of proof. The plaintiffs relied upon
an extremely reliable source of information (which was, unusually, incorrect) but they
were nevertheless unable to discharge the onus of proof because they had the correct
information in their possession at the relevant time. This suggests that it will be no easy
task for a representor to show that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts
represented were true. In many ways 
Howard Marine
 
underlines the oddity of the
fiction of fraud because, on the basis of the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Royscot
,
the plaintiffs in 
Howard Marine
 
were liable to pay damages as if they had been
fraudulent. Yet the defendants never even succeeded in proving that they had been
negligent!
When deciding whether or not the party had reasonable grounds to believe and did
believe that the facts represented were true, it is the belief of the representor that is
relevant and not an agent of the representor. Thus it will not suffice for a representor to
show that an agent had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe that the facts
represented were true. Section 2(1) is concerned with the liability of the ‘other party’ to
the contract (and the ‘other party’ for this purpose does not include the agent of that
party: 
Resolute Maritime Inc
 
v. 
Nippon Kaiji Kyokai, The Skopas
 
[1983] 1 WLR 857).
Thus, where the ‘other party’ is a company, it is only the belief of a party who can be
identified with the company itself that is relevant (
MCI WorldCom International Inc
 
v.
Primus Telecommunications Inc
 
[2003] EWHC 2182 (Comm), [2004] 1 All ER (Comm)
138).
Section 2(1) is therefore a very powerful weapon in the hands of a claimant. It is better
than a claim in the tort of negligence because the remoteness rule is more generous,
there is no need to show that the defendant owed a duty of care to the claimant, nor is it
necessary for the claimant to show that the defendant has breached his duty of care. A
claim under section 2(1) is also more advantageous than a claim in deceit because the
claimant can recover the same measure of damages as in a deceit claim without having
to prove that the defendant had been fraudulent. Are there any circumstances in which a
claimant would find it preferable to invoke the tort of deceit or the tort of negligence?
The obvious circumstance is where the claimant is not in a contractual relationship with
the party who made the misrepresentation. In such a case the claimant must bring a
claim in tort and cannot bring a claim under section 2(1). Secondly, a claimant who has
himself been careless might find it advantageous to bring a claim in the tort of deceit in
order to avoid the defence of contributory negligence (see earlier in this section).
Thirdly, a court may hesitate to find the existence of a misrepresentation in a claim
brought under section 2(1) given the Draconian consequences which can flow from the
finding that there has been a misrepresentation: 
Avon Insurance plc
 
v. 
Swire Fraser Ltd
[2000] 1 All ER (Comm) 573, 633 and 
Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG
 
v. 
Royal
Bank of Scotland plc
 
[2010] EWHC 1392 (Comm), [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 123, [85]. In
such a case a claimant may want to consider bringing an action in the tort of negligence.
Fourthly, it may be the case that section 2(1) cannot be applied to a case in which the
misrepresentation is to be found in the contract itself but was not made before the
contract was entered into (
Leofelis SA
 
v. 
Lonsdale 
Sports Ltd
 
[2008] EWCA Civ 460,
[2008] All ER (D) 87 (Jul), [141]). In such a case the claimant cannot state that it has
entered into a contract ‘after’ a misrepresentation has been made to it. Fifthly, the
section is concerned only with representations made by a person who enters into a
contract with the representee and with losses arising as a result of entering into that
contract. There is nothing in the section to support the conclusion that, where A is
induced to enter into a contract with B as a result of a misrepresentation made by C (C
not acting as the agent of B), A can recover damages from C under the subsection. The
subsection entitles the representee to recover only such damages as flow from its having
entered into a contract with the representor (
Taberna Europe CDO II plc
 
v. 
Selskabet
AF1 (formerly Roskilde Bank A/S)
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 1262, [2017] QB 633). Finally,
section 2(4) of the 1967 Act provides that a claimant who has a right to redress under
Part 4A of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (SI
2008/1277) is not entitled to be paid damages under section 2(1) in respect of conduct
constituting the misrepresentation.
17.5.2
 
Common Law Negligence
A claimant may be able to bring an action for damages in the tort of negligence. In order
to do so a claimant must prove that the defendant owes to him a duty of care and that he
has breached that duty of care (in other words, that he has been careless). The decision
of the House of Lords in 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465
transformed this area of the law. A discussion of 
Hedley Byrne
 
liability can be found in
the judgments of the Court of Appeal in 
Howard Marine
 
(
17.5.1
; for more modern
analysis of the scope of 
Hedley Byrne
 
liability, see S Deakin and Z Adams, 
Markesinis
and Deakin’s Tort Law
 
(8th edn, Oxford University Press, 2019), pp. 127–137). The
advantages of a claim under section 2(1) over a claim in the tort of negligence are
discussed at 
17.5.1

17.5.3
 
Deceit
Thirdly, a claimant may be able to bring an action for damages in the tort of deceit. Prior
to the decision of the House of Lords in 
Hedley Byrne
 
a plaintiff who wished to recover
damages for misrepresentation had to prove that the misrepresentation was made
fraudulently and fraud is no easy matter to prove. The leading case is:
DERRY V. PEEK
(1889) 14 App Cas 337, House of Lords
The defendants were directors of a tramways company. They issued a prospectus
stating that the company had the right to use steam power instead of horses when,
in fact, under the terms of the relevant Act, the consent of the Board of Trade was
required. The plaintiff subscribed for shares in the company on the strength of the
prospectus. The Board of Trade subsequently refused to consent to the use of
steam power and the company was wound up. The plaintiff brought an action in
deceit against the directors. The trial judge found against the plaintiff, but the Court
of Appeal reversed the trial judge’s decision. The House of Lords reversed the
decision of the Court of Appeal, on the basis that an action in deceit requires actual
fraud, which is not satisfied merely by the absence of a reasonable basis for the
erroneous belief. As the defendants honestly believed that their statement was
true, the plaintiff’s action failed.
Lord Herschell
‘This action is one which is commonly called an action of deceit, a mere common
law action.’ This is the description of it given by Cotton LJ in delivering judgment. I
think it important that it should be borne in mind that such an action differs
essentially from one brought to obtain rescission of a contract on the ground of
misrepresentation of a material fact. The principles which govern the two actions
differ widely. Where rescission is claimed it is only necessary to prove that there
was misrepresentation; then, however honestly it may have been made, however
free from blame the person who made it, the contract, having been obtained by
misrepresentation, cannot stand. In an action of deceit, on the contrary, it is not
enough to establish misrepresentation alone; it is conceded on all hands that
something more must be proved to cast liability upon the defendant, though it has
been a matter of controversy what additional elements are requisite …
I think the authorities establish the following propositions: First, in order to
sustain an action of deceit, there must be proof of fraud, and nothing short of that
will suffice. Secondly, fraud is proved when it is shewn that a false representation
has been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly,
careless whether it be true or false. Although I have treated the second and third
as distinct cases, I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who
makes a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the truth
of what he states. To prevent a false statement being fraudulent, there must, I
think, always be an honest belief in its truth. And this probably covers the whole
ground, for one who knowingly alleges that which is false, has obviously no such
honest belief. Thirdly, if fraud be proved, the motive of the person guilty of it is
immaterial. It matters not that there was no intention to cheat or injure the person
to whom the statement was made …
In my opinion making a false statement through want of care falls far short of,
and is a very different thing from, fraud, and the same may be said of a false
representation honestly believed though on insufficient grounds …
I have arrived with some reluctance at the conclusion to which I have felt
myself compelled, for I think those who put before the public a prospectus to
induce them to embark their money in a commercial enterprise ought to be vigilant
to see that it contains such representations only as are in strict accordance with
fact, and I should be very unwilling to give any countenance to the contrary idea. I
think there is much to be said for the view that this moral duty ought to some
extent to be converted into a legal obligation, and that the want of reasonable care
to see that statements, made under such circumstances, are true, should be made
an actionable wrong. But this is not a matter fit for discussion on the present
occasion. If it is to be done the legislature must intervene and expressly give a
right of action in respect of such a departure from duty. It ought not, I think, to be
done by straining the law, and holding that to be fraudulent which the tribunal feels
cannot properly be so described. I think mischief is likely to result from blurring the
distinction between carelessness and fraud, and equally holding a man fraudulent
whether his acts can or cannot be justly so designated.

Commentary
The opening paragraph from the judgment of Lord Herschell demonstrates the
difference between a claim for rescission and a claim for damages. A claim to rescind a
contract has never required proof of fraud, whereas an action for damages, until 1963,
did require such proof. As the judgment of Lord Herschell makes clear, fraud is not an
easy matter to prove and, indeed, it should not even be pleaded unless there is a
substantial basis for the allegation of fraud. This being the case, section 2(1) of the 1967
Act offers a much more attractive route for a claimant who is in a contractual
relationship with the defendant misrepresentor because it gives the claimant the
advantages of a claim in deceit without having to assume the difficult task of alleging
and proving fraud.
17.5.4
 
Section 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act
1967
Section 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 gives the court a discretion to award
damages in lieu of rescission (see 
17.4.2
). What is the measure of damages recoverable
under section 2(2)? This issue was considered by the Court of Appeal in 
William Sindall
plc
 
v. 
Cambridgeshire County Council
 
[1994] 1 WLR 1016 (
17.4.2
) in the following
terms:
Hoffmann LJ
The section speaks in terms of loss suffered rather than damages recoverable but clearly contemplates that if the
contract is upheld, such loss will be compensated by an award of damages. Section 2(2) therefore gives a power
to award damages in circumstances in which no damages would previously have been recoverable.
Furthermore, such damages will be compensation for loss caused by the misrepresentation, whether it was
negligent or not. This is made clear by section 2(3), which provides:
‘Damages may be awarded under subsection (2) of this section whether or not he is liable to damages
under subsection (1) thereof, but where he is so liable any award under subsection (2) shall be taken into
account in assessing his liability under the said subsection (1).’
Damages under section 2(2) are therefore damages for the misrepresentation as such. What would be the
measure of such damages? This court is not directly concerned with quantum, which would be determined at an
inquiry. But since the court, in the exercise of its discretion, needs to know whether damages under section 2(2)
would be an adequate remedy and to be able to compare such damages with the loss which rescission would
cause to Cambridgeshire, it is necessary to decide in principle how the damages would be calculated.
The Law Reform Committee drew the analogy with Lord Cairns’s Act (the Chancery Amendment Act 1858
(21 & 22 Vict. c. 27)) and in some respects this analogy is a good one. But it breaks down when one comes to
decide the measure of damages. Under Lord Cairns’s Act, the plaintiff who is refused specific performance or an
injunction is left to his damages in contract or tort. The measure of such damages is exactly what it would be at
common law: see 
Johnson
 
v. 
Agnew
 
[1980] AC 367, 400. The only change made by the Act was to give a remedy
for purely equitable rights, such as breach of a restrictive covenant to which the plaintiff was not a party. But in
such cases the common law analogy enabled a suitable measure of damages to be devised. Section 2(2), on the
other hand, creates a power to award damages in a wholly new situation.
Under section 2(1), the measure of damages is the same as for fraudulent misrepresentation, i.e. all loss
caused by the plaintiff having been induced to enter into the contract: 
Cemp Properties (UK) Ltd
 
v. 
Dentsply
Research & Development Corporation
 
[1991] 2 EGLR 197. This means that the misrepresentor is invariably
deprived of the benefit of the bargain (e.g. any difference between the price paid and the value of the thing sold)
and may have to pay additional damages for consequential loss suffered by the representee on account of having
entered into the contract. In my judgment, however, it is clear that this will not necessarily be the measure of
damages under section 2(2).
First, section 2(1) provides for damages to be awarded to a person who ‘has entered into a contract after a
misrepresentation has been made to him by another party and as a result thereof’—[that is to say] of having
entered into the contract—‘he has suffered loss’. In contrast, section 2(2) speaks of ‘the loss which would be
caused by it’—[that is to say] the misrepresentation—‘if the contract were upheld’. In my view, section 2(1) is
concerned with the damage flowing from having entered into the contract, while section 2(2) is concerned with
damage caused by the property not being what it was represented to be.
Secondly, section 2(3) contemplates that damages under section 2(2) may be less than damages under
section 2(1) and should be taken into account when assessing damages under the latter subsection. This only
makes sense if the measure of damages may be different.
Thirdly, the Law Reform Committee report makes it clear that section 2(2) was enacted because it was
thought that it might be a hardship to the representor to be deprived of the whole benefit of the bargain on
account of a minor misrepresentation. It could not possibly have intended the damages in lieu to be assessed on
a principle which would invariably have the same effect.
The Law Reform Committee drew attention to the anomaly which already existed by which a minor
misrepresentation gave rise to a right of rescission whereas a warranty in the same terms would have grounded
no more than a claim for modest damages. It said that this anomaly would be exaggerated if its
recommendation for abolition of the bar on rescission after completion were to be implemented. I think that
section 2(2) was intended to give the court a power to eliminate this anomaly by upholding the contract and
compensating the plaintiff for the loss he has suffered on account of the property not having been what it was
represented to be. In other words, damages under section 2(2) should never exceed the sum which would have
been awarded if the representation had been a warranty. It is not necessary for present purposes to discuss the
circumstances in which they may be less.
If one looks at the matter when Sindall purported to rescind, the loss which would be caused if the contract
were upheld was relatively small: the £18,000 it would have cost to divert the sewer, the loss of a plot and
interest charges on any consequent delay at the rate of £2,000 a day. If one looks at the matter at the date of
trial, the loss would have been nil because the sewer had been diverted.
Evans LJ
Section 2(3) makes it clear that the statutory power to award damages under section 2(2) is distinct from the
plaintiff’s right to recover damages under section 2(1) …
There is … much room for debate as to the ‘loss that would be caused if the contract were upheld’. The
subsection assumes, as I read it, that this loss will be compensated by the damages awarded, if the contract is
upheld. But if the measure is the same as those awarded in respect of a fraudulent misrepresentation (
Doyle
 
v.
Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd
 
[1969] 2 QB 
158) or under section 2(1) (
Cemp Properties (UK) Ltd
 
v. 
Dentsply
Research and Development Corporation
 
[1991] 2 EGLR 197; cf. 
Royscot Trust Ltd
 
v. 
Rogerson
 
[1991] 2 QB
297) in cases where the contract continues in force, then two consequences seem to follow. First damages under
section 2(2) are co-extensive with those under section 2(1), whereas section 2(3) suggests that they are or may
be different. Secondly, an innocent and non-negligent defendant will be liable under section 2(2) for damages
which he is specifically excused under section 2(1). Furthermore, if the plaintiff recovers full compensation
under section 2(2), if the contract is upheld, then he will not suffer any net loss, assuming that the damages are
paid.
In my judgment, it is not correct that the measure of damages under section 2(2) for the loss that would be
caused by the misrepresentation if the contract were upheld is the same measure as under section 2(1). The
latter is established by the common law and it is the amount required to compensate the party to whom the
misrepresentation was made for all the losses which he has sustained by reason of his acting upon it at the time
when he did. But the damages contemplated by section 2(2) are damages in lieu of rescission. The starting point
for the application of the sub-section is the situation where a plaintiff has established a right to rescind the
contract on grounds of innocent misrepresentation: its object is to ameliorate for the innocent misrepresentor
the harsh consequences of rescission for a wholly innocent (meaning, non-negligent as well as non-fraudulent)
misrepresentor, in a case where it is fairer to uphold the contract and award damages against him. Such an
award of damages was not permitted in law or equity before 1967. The court, therefore, exercises a statutory
jurisdiction and it does so having regard to the circumstances at the date of the hearing, when otherwise
rescission would be ordered. …
When the court is required to form its own view of what is equitable between the parties at the date of the
hearing, it is dangerous to lay down any hard-and-fast rule to the effect that no account can be taken of changed
market values. Apart from the capital value of the subject matter of the contract, as here, which might rise or fall
during the intervening period, there might be relevant market trading conditions which the court could properly
take into account: cf. 
The Lucy
 
[1983] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 188. Moreover, if it is right to take account of the current
market value in assessing the loss which would be sustained by the council, if rescission were ordered, then it
would be ‘inequitable’ not to have regard to this factor in the case of the builders also. But the effect of doing so
is merely to restate the issue which the court has to decide: in the circumstances of the case, should the loss of
market remain where it presently lies?
Viewed in this way, it would be substantially unjust, in my judgment, to deprive Cambridgeshire of the
bargain which it made in 1988, albeit that the bargain was induced by a misrepresentation innocently made, but
which was of little importance in relation to the contract as a whole. That misrepresentation apart, Sindall made
what has proved to be so far an unfortunate bargain for them (although they remain owners of an important
potential development site in what is a notoriously cyclical market). To permit them to transfer the financial
consequences to Cambridgeshire, in the circumstances of this case, could properly be described as a windfall for
them.
For the above reasons, and taking into account the nature of the alleged representation and the history of the
matter generally, including Sindall’s deliberate failure to make any serious attempt to find a solution to the
difficulty which arose when the sewer was discovered, the equitable balance, in my judgment, lies in favour of
upholding the contract and awarding damages in lieu of rescission in this case. If there were a live issue under
section 2(2), I would award damages in lieu of rescission and order the amount of such damages to be assessed.
There remains the question of whether these damages should include the decline in the market value of the
land since the contract was made. As indicated, above in my judgment they should not … The recovery of such
damages in the present case, even if the tortious measure 
under section 2(2) applies, appears to be barred by
the following three obstacles: (1) such damage was caused, not by the misrepresentation, but by the subsequent
fall in market values, an extraneous cause; (2) the authorities suggest that the plaintiff’s loss has to be assessed
at the date when the property was transferred: 
McGregor on Damages
, 15th ed., para 1727 citing 
Waddell
 
v.
Blockey
 
(1879) 4 QBD 678; and (3) if a subsequent rise, or fall, in market values is relevant at the date of trial,
then a chance element enters into the calculation, whether the contract is rescinded or not. I should add,
however, that the reported authorities are sparse, as McGregor emphasises, and as I read them they do not
purport to decide the question whether a decline in value until the time of discovery of the true facts is
necessarily excluded.
It is sufficient for present purposes to say that an award of damages in lieu of rescission under section 2(2)
should in my view be calculated as I have described above.
For these reasons, as well as those given by Hoffmann LJ, I would allow this appeal.
Russell LJ
 
concurred with both judgments.
Commentary
Since 
William Sindall
 
was decided, the House of Lords has held in 
South Australia
Asset Management Corporation
 
v. 
York Montague Ltd
 
[1997] AC 191 that the scope of
the duty of care owed by a valuer to a lender did not extend to a fall in the value of the
property market subsequent to the valuation. The damages recoverable were held to be
confined to the difference between the correct valuation of the property at the time at
which the valuation was done and the valuation negligently provided by the defendant.
It has been suggested (H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell,
2021), para 9–117) that the same approach should be taken to a claim under section 2(2)
so that damages ‘should be limited to any difference between the contract price and the
actual value of the property taking account of the misrepresentation but not taking into
account the general fall in the value of the property’.
It should be noted that section 2(2) does not confer on a claimant a right to recover
damages. It confers a 
discretion
 
on the court to award damages in lieu of rescission. The
court only has jurisdiction to award damages under section 2(2) if it also has jurisdiction
to rescind the contract at the date of the hearing or the date on which the innocent party
purported to rescind the contract (see 
Salt
 
v. 
Stratstone Specialist Ltd
 
[2015] EWCA Civ
745, [2015] 2 CLC 269). The unavailability of rescission thus deprives the court of the
jurisdiction to award damages under section 2(2). The discretion is one to award
damages ‘in lieu of’ rescission so that a claimant who wishes to rescind the contract
cannot invoke section 2(2) in order to recover damages. Section 2(4) of the 1967 Act
provides that a claimant who has a right to redress under Part 4A of the Consumer
Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/1277) is not entitled to be
paid damages under section 2(2) in respect of conduct constituting the
misrepresentation.
17.5.5
 
Rescission and an ‘Indemnity’
A claimant who rescinds a contract may also be able to bring a claim for what is often
referred to as an indemnity, although it is probably more accurate to describe it as a
personal restitutionary claim. In 
Whittington
 
v. 
Seale-Hayne
 
(1900) 82 LT 49 the
plaintiff entered into a lease of a farm which he intended to use for breeding prize
poultry. He was induced to enter into the lease by misrepresentations made by the
defendant that the premises were in a good 
state of repair and in a sanitary condition.
The premises were not sanitary and the buildings were in a state of disrepair. As a result
the plaintiff became ill and many of the birds died. The plaintiff claimed that he was
entitled to set aside the lease and recover an indemnity in respect of the losses which he
had suffered in the performance of the contract before it was set aside. It was held that
he was not entitled to recover an indemnity in respect of the loss of his birds and the
illness which he suffered. At the time at which the case was decided damages could only
be recovered in respect of a fraudulent misrepresentation (see 
17.5
) and the plaintiff
could not establish that the defendant had made the misrepresentations fraudulently.
But the plaintiff was able to recover the rent paid and the cost of the repair work that
had been done pursuant to an order issued by the local authority. These obligations were
imposed on him by the terms of the lease. The reason for his entitlement to recover
these payments was that they had resulted in an enrichment to the defendant (either
through the direct payment of rent or by carrying out the work ordered by the local
authority) and, when the lease was set aside, the defendant became subject to a
restitutionary liability to repay to the plaintiff the value of the benefits which he had
received as a result of the plaintiff’s performance of his obligations under the lease. But
he was not subject to any wider liability to pay compensation to the plaintiff for the
losses which he had suffered.
17.6
 
Exclusion of Liability for
Misrepresentation
A party cannot exclude liability for his own fraudulent misrepresentation (
S Pearson &
Son Ltd
 
v. 
Dublin Corporation
 
[1907] AC 351). The question whether English law allows
a party to exclude liability for the fraud of his employee or agent is presently unclear.
The Court of Appeal in 
HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd
 
v. 
Chase Manhattan
Bank
 
[2001] EWCA Civ 1250, [2001] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 483 at [103] held that liability for the
fraud or dishonesty of employees and agents in the 
performance
 
of a contract could be
excluded but left open the question whether or not it was possible to exclude liability for
the fraud of one’s employee or agent in the negotiation of a contract. On appeal the
House of Lords also left the latter point open (see [2003] UKHL 6, [2003] 2 Lloyd’s Rep
61). Two views are possible. The first is that it is not possible as a matter of law to
exclude liability for the dishonesty of one’s employee or agent in the negotiation of a
contract. The second is that it is possible to exclude liability for the dishonesty of one’s
employee or agent in the negotiation of a contract provided that sufficiently clear words
are used. However, the difference between the two views may not matter a great deal in
practice because of the insistence on the part of the courts that parties use clear
language if they wish to exclude liability for the fraud of their agents (and the
unlikelihood of a party using such clear language). Thus in 
HIH Casualty and General
Insurance Ltd
 
v. 
Chase Manhattan Bank
 
Lord Bingham stated (at [16]):
For it is in my opinion plain beyond argument that if a party to a written contract seeks to exclude the ordinary
consequences of fraudulent or dishonest misrepresentation or deceit by his agent, acting as such, inducing the
making of the contract, such intention must be expressed in clear and unmistakable terms on the face of the
contract. The decision of the House in 
Pearson
 
v. 
Dublin Corporation
 
does at least make plain that general
language will not be construed to relieve a principal of liability for the fraud of an 
agent: see in particular the
speeches of Lord Loreburn LC at page 354, Lord Ashbourne at page 360 and Lord Atkinson at page 365.
General words, however comprehensive the legal analyst might find them to be, will not serve: the language
used must be such as will alert a commercial party to the extraordinary bargain he is invited to make. It is no
doubt unattractive for a contracting party to propose a term clearly having such effect, because of its predictable
effect on the mind of the other contracting party, and this may explain why the point of principle left open in
Pearson
 
v. 
Dublin Corporation
 
has remained unresolved for so long.
The ability of a contracting party to exclude liability for misrepresentation is regulated
(1)
(a)
(b)
(2)
by section 3 of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 which provides:
If a contract contains a term which would exclude or restrict—
any liability to which a party to a contract may be subject by reason of any misrepresentation
made by him before the contract was made; or
any remedy available to another party to the contract by reason of such a misrepresentation,
that term shall be of no effect except in so far as it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated
in section 11(1) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977; and it is for those claiming that the term satisfies
that requirement to show that it does.
This section does not apply to a term in a consumer contract within the meaning of Part 2 of the
Consumer Rights Act 2015 (but see the provision made about such contracts in section 62 of that Act).
The principles applied by the courts when deciding whether or not a clause is reasonable
have been discussed earlier (
13.3.7
). It is probably wise not to attempt to exclude
liability for ‘any representation or warranty’ because such a clause may, as a matter of
interpretation, extend to a fraudulent misrepresentation and an attempt to exclude
liability for fraudulent misrepresentation must be unreasonable (see 
Thomas Witter Ltd
v. 
TBP Industries Ltd
 
[1996] 2 All ER 573; for a contrary view see 
Zanzibar
 
v. 
British
Aerospace (Lancaster House) Ltd
 
[2000] 1 WLR 2333, where it was held that the words
‘any representation’ were not apt, as a matter of construction, to encompass a fraudulent
misrepresentation, given that liability for fraud generally cannot be excluded, see earlier
in this section). It is, however, safer to state that the exclusion or limitation applies to
any representation other than one made fraudulently.
An issue which has proved to be extremely controversial is the scope of section 3. A
particular controversy has been whether it is possible to avoid the application of the
section by drafting a clause which purports to set out the ‘basis’ on which the contract
was entered into or which provides that ‘no reliance’ has been placed on any statement
made by one party to the other prior to entry into the contract. In providing that ‘no
reliance’ can be placed on a statement made, the aim was to deny the existence of a
misrepresentation to which the section could apply, given that the essence of a
misrepresentation is that it is a statement 
upon which reliance has been placed
 
by the
person to whom the statement was made. An example of such a clause is to be found in
clause 5.8 of the lease entered into between the parties 
in 
First Tower Trustees Ltd
 
v.
CDS (Superstores International) Ltd
 
[2018] EWCA Civ 1396, [2019] 1 WLR 637, which
was in the following terms:
‘The tenant acknowledges that this lease has not been entered into in reliance wholly or partly on any statement
or representation made by or on behalf of the landlord.’
On the facts the landlord was found to have made misrepresentations to the tenant
relating to the premises which were the subject matter of the lease. The issue before the
Court of Appeal was whether clause 5.8 was effective to exclude that liability in
misrepresentation, and the answer to that question turned, in part, on the issue whether
or not clause 5.8 was caught by section 3. The Court of Appeal held that it was so caught
and expressed their conclusions in the following terms:
Lewison LJ
51. Section 3 of the 1967 Act must be interpreted so as to give effect to its evident policy. That policy, in my
judgment, is to prevent contracting parties from escaping from liability for misrepresentation unless it is
reasonable for them to do so. How they seek to avoid that liability is subsidiary. In 
Cremdean Properties
 
v.
Nash
 
[1977] 2 EGLR 80, it was argued that a term in a pre-contractual notice nullified the effect of any
representation. Bridge LJ held that it did not have that effect but went on to say:
‘But I would go further and say that if the ingenuity of a draftsman could devise language which would
have that effect, I am extremely doubtful whether the court would allow it to operate so as to defeat
section 3. Supposing the vendor included a clause which the purchaser was required to, and did, agree to
in some such terms as “notwithstanding any statement of fact included in these particulars the vendor
shall be conclusively deemed to have made no representation within the meaning of the
Misrepresentation Act 1967,” I should have thought that that was only a form of words the intended and
actual effect of which was to exclude or restrict liability, and I should not have thought that the courts
would have been ready to allow such ingenuity in forms of language to defeat the plain purpose at which
section 3 is aimed. …’
67. I would hold, therefore, that a clause which simply states (as clause 12.1 of the agreement for lease and
clause 5.8 of the lease do) ‘that this lease has not been entered into in reliance wholly or partly on any statement
or representation made by or on behalf of the landlord’ is a contract term which would have the effect of
excluding liability for misrepresentation; and consequently is subject to the test of reasonableness. Accordingly,
in my judgment the judge in our case was right to conclude as he did. I do not consider that a conclusion to this
effect should cause consternation. It will always be open to a contracting party seeking to rely on such a clause
to establish that it was reasonable; and in cases involving the sale of complex financial products to sophisticated
investors it may well be. …
Leggatt LJ
99. Even if, by giving the language of section 3 of the Act a strained interpretation, a distinction could be drawn
between a contract term which would exclude liability and a term which would prevent liability from arising,
there is no reason to draw such a formalistic distinction and good 
reason not to interpret section 3 in a way
which omits the latter type of term from its scope. The result of doing so would be that a lawyer drafting
boilerplate provisions could avoid the application of section 3 purely by the choice of words in which the clause
is phrased. A clause stating that a party will have no liability for any representation made or on which the other
party has relied on any view falls within section 3 and is subject to the requirement of reasonableness. But on
this interpretation, if instead the clause were worded to say that A agrees not to assert that B has made or that A
has relied on any representation, section 3 would not apply. No rational legislator could have intended that the
need for a contract term to satisfy a test of reasonableness could be avoided simply by felicity in drafting the
contract term. …
100.
 
[Counsel for the landlord] submitted that, in determining whether clause 5.8 of the lease falls within
section 3, it is relevant that the clause was contained in a contract made between sophisticated commercial
parties who should be taken to have understood the effect of what they were agreeing and allowed to agree what
they choose. …
103.
 
Quite apart from authority, to read into section 3 an implied limitation which would make its
application depend on who the parties to the contract are is not only unwarranted by the statutory language but
inconsistent with the scheme of the Unfair Contract Terms Act. …
104.
 
The decision to make section 3 applicable to all contracts induced by misrepresentation, irrespective of
the nature and subject matter of the contract and the identity of the contracting parties, is readily
understandable. The importance which English law attaches to the freedom of parties to contract on whatever
terms they choose depends crucially on the assumption that their consent to the terms of the contract has been
obtained fairly. That is not the case where one party’s consent has been induced by a misrepresentation made
by the other contracting party. Misrepresentation is a paradigm ‘vitiating factor’ which undermines the validity
of a contract. This does not mean that a party cannot choose to give up the right to complain that its consent to
the terms of the contract was obtained by misrepresentation. But in so far as a contract term is said to have
removed that right, a control mechanism is needed to ensure that this term was a fair and reasonable one to
include. That, at all events, is the policy which Parliament has thought it right to adopt. It is the duty of the
courts to uphold and not to subvert that policy choice.
105.
 
This is not to doubt that the level of sophistication of a contracting party is relevant in determining
whether a term is effective to prevent the party from obtaining a remedy for misrepresentation. But its
relevance is to the question whether, having regard to the circumstances which were or ought reasonably to
have been known to or in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made, it was fair and
reasonable to exclude liability. It is not a ground for bypassing that question.
The focus of the Court of Appeal is here on the substance or effect of the clause rather
than its form. This being the case, it would appear that the ability to avoid the reach of
section 3 by mere drafting devices is very limited (although it may not be entirely
impossible, given the view of the Court of Appeal in the earlier case of 
Taberna Europe
CDO II plc
 
v. 
Selskabet AF1 (formerly Roskilde Bank A/S)
 
[2016] EWCA Civ 1262,
[2017] QB 633, [20] that section 3 ‘is concerned with attempts to exclude liability after
the event’ and that it ‘is not concerned with the question whether there has actually been
a representation’). The justification for this focus on substance rather than form is
twofold. The first justification is the desire to uphold the policy behind the enactment of
section 3 (see [51] and [99]). The second (at [104]) is the fact that English law attaches
importance to the freedom of parties to a contract to agree 
on the terms of their contract
but it does so on the basis that ‘their consent to the terms of the contract has been
obtained fairly’ and that is not the case where the consent of one party has been induced
by a misrepresentation made by the other contracting party. From this it would appear
to follow that whether the clause takes the form of a ‘no-reliance’ provision or a clause
which purports to define the ‘basis’ on which the parties have entered into the contract,
it will fall within the scope of section 3 and be subject to the reasonableness test. This
being the case, rather than seek to exclude the operation of section 3, parties would be
well advised to focus their attention instead on the reasonableness of any clause which
seeks to exclude or restrict liability in respect of a statement which would otherwise
amount to a misrepresentation.

Duress
Central Issues
A contract can be set aside on the ground that it has been entered into
under duress. Duress can take different forms. The principal forms are
duress of the person, duress of goods, and economic duress.
Outside the category of duress to the person, the law has been slow to
develop. It was not until 1976 that the courts first recognized the
existence of economic duress. A consequence of the late development
of economic duress is that a number of questions remain unanswered
in relation to the scope of the doctrine. There appear to be three
central elements, namely (i) illegitimate pressure applied by one party
which (ii) constitutes a (significant) cause inducing the other party to
enter into the contract and (iii) leaves the claimant with no reasonable
alternative but to give in to the pressure.
It is generally agreed that ‘illegitimate pressure’ includes a threat to
commit a crime and a threat to commit a tort. It is also agreed that a
threatened breach of contract can constitute illegitimate pressure but
it is not yet clear whether all threatened breaches of contract are
illegitimate for this purpose. Particularly difficult is the case where the
threat is made in the bona fide belief that what has been threatened is
not a breach of contract but it subsequently transpires that that belief
is mistaken and that what has been threatened is, in fact, a breach of
contract. A further difficulty arises where the pressure applied by the
defendant is lawful. The Supreme Court has confirmed that a doctrine
of lawful act duress does exist in English law, albeit if operates within
very narrow (and contested) limits. The definition of ‘illegitimacy’ is
one of the major issues in this chapter.
The test to be applied to determine whether there is a sufficient causal
link between the illegitimate pressure and the entry by the claimant
5.
into the contract may depend upon the form that the duress assumes.
Where it takes the form of duress of the person it would appear
sufficient that the illegitimate pressure was ‘a’ cause of the claimant’s
decision to enter into the contract, whereas in the case of economic
duress it would appear that the illegitimate pressure must have been a
‘significant’ cause of the decision to enter into the contract. If this is
so, why should the law distinguish between duress of the person and
economic duress in this way?
Other factors taken into account by the courts when deciding whether
or not economic duress has been established on the facts of a case
include whether the victim had any realistic practical alternative but to
submit to the pressure, whether the victim protested at the time, and
whether he affirmed the contract at a time when the victim was free of
the pressure that had been applied by the defendant. These factors
would seem to be relevant to the question of whether or not there is a
sufficient causal link between the illegitimate pressure and the
decision of the claimant to enter into the contract but the courts
appear to regard them as distinct, free-standing elements which must
be taken into account. While the existence of duress must ultimately
depend upon a careful evaluation of the facts and circumstances of
the case, the danger with a multi-factor approach is a lack of
consistency as different courts place different emphasis on the
different factors.
18.1
 
Introduction
Duress of the person is well established in the authorities. By contrast, duress of goods
and economic duress have had a more uncertain career. Duress of goods was stunted for
many years by the decision in 
Skeate
 
v. 
Beale
 
(1841) 11 Ad & E 983, in which it was held
that the unlawful detention of goods belonging to another did not constitute duress.
Economic duress (that is to say a case in which one party uses his superior economic
power in an illegitimate manner in order to compel the other party to agree to enter into
a contract or to enter the contract on particular terms) was not formally recognized until
the decision of Kerr J in 
Occidental Worldwide Investment Corporation
 
v. 
Skibs A/S
Avanti (The Siboen and The Sibotre)
 
[1976] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 293.
The late recognition of economic duress and the problems posed for the development of
a coherent doctrine of duress of goods by 
Skeate
 
v. 
Beale
 
meant that judges who wished
to avoid giving effect to an agreement that had been procured by the application of
illegitimate pressure had to find other doctrinal pegs on which to hang their decision. A
classic example of this phenomenon is said to be the decision of Lord Ellenborough in
Stilk
 
v. 
Myrick
 
(1809) 2 Camp 317, 6 Esp 129 (discussed in more detail at 
5.2.2.3.1
). The
argument which is advanced by some authors and judges is that, in the absence of a
developed doctrine of duress, Lord Ellenborough had to make use of the doctrine of
consideration in order to find that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the promised
extra pay. The obvious difficulty with this argument is that there was little evidence of
duress on the facts of 
Stilk
, given that the vessel was in port at the time at which the
master promised to share the wages of the deserters with the remainder of the crew
provided that they worked the ship back to London. However, leaving these factual
difficulties to one side, it is clear that the modern trend is to regard duress as the more
appropriate regulator of contract modifications (see 
United States
 
v. 
Stump Homes
Specialties Manufacturing Inc
 
905 F 2d 1117 (1990), 
5.2.2.3.2.3
 
and 
The Alev
 
[1989] 1
Lloyd’s Rep 138, 147, 
5.2.2.3.2.3
). The desirability of this development is open to
question (
5.2.2.3.2.3
) but there can be little doubt that it is taking place. As a result
duress is likely to play a greater role in the modern case-law, yet judges will find that it
does not provide ready-made answers to the questions that are asked of them. The
consequence will be a degree of uncertainty in the case-law until the doctrine settles
down and its limits are established.
That said, the essential elements of duress do now appear to be firmly established, albeit
significant issues remain to be resolved in relation to some aspects of these elements.
The most recent authoritative exposition of the elements of duress was provided by Lord
Burrows in 
Pakistan International Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK) Ltd
 
[2021]
UKSC 40, [2021] 3 WLR 727 as follows:
78. Where it is alleged that one contracting party (the defendant) has induced the other contracting party (the
claimant) to enter into the contract between them by duress, the case law has laid down that there are two
essential elements that a claimant needs to establish in order to succeed in a claim for rescission of the contract.
The first is a threat (or pressure exerted) by the defendant that is illegitimate. The second is that that
illegitimate threat (or pressure) caused the claimant to enter into the contract. As Lord Goff said, in the context
of economic duress, in 
Dimskal Shipping Co SA
 
v. 
International Transport Workers’ Federation (The Evia
Luck) (No 2)
 
[1992] 2 AC 152, 165:
‘[I]t is now accepted that economic pressure may be sufficient to amount to duress [which would entitle a
party to avoid a contract] provided at least that the economic pressure may be characterised as
illegitimate and has constituted a significant cause inducing the plaintiff to enter into the relevant
contract … ’
79. It is also important that, in the context of economic duress (but the position appears to be different in
respect of other forms of duress: see 
Astley
 
v. 
Reynolds
 
(1731) 2 Strange 916), there is a third element. This is
that the claimant must have had no reasonable alternative to giving in to the threat (or pressure): see, for
example, Dyson J in 
DSND Subsea Ltd (formerly DSND Oceantech Ltd)
 
v. 
Petroleum Geo-Services ASA
 
[2000]
BLR 530, para 131; 
Borrelli
 
v. 
Ting
 
[2010] UKPC 21; [2010] Bus LR 1718, para 35.
The principal issues in this definition that remain to be resolved relate to the exact
meaning of ‘illegitimate’ and the precise nature of the causal link that must be
established between the threat or pressure and the decision of the claimant to enter into
the contract. Both of these issues will be examined during the course of this chapter.
There is one further basis for duress which should be mentioned, only to be dismissed,
and that is the unfairness of the terms of the contract (commonly referred to as
‘substantive unfairness’, on which see 
20.1
). While substantive unfairness is a common
feature of duress cases, it does not constitute the foundation of the doctrine. The reason
for this is that the presence of substantive unfairness is not, of itself, sufficient to
constitute duress, nor is its absence sufficient to negative the existence of duress. For
example, if I am compelled by circumstances to sell my house quickly and forced to
lower the price, the unfairness of the price will not of itself suffice to demonstrate the
existence of duress. On the other hand, if a robber forces me at gunpoint to sell my
house for a fair price, the fairness of the price will not prevent me from setting aside the
contract on the ground of duress. What is wrong with the contract is not the fairness or
the unfairness of the terms of the contract, but the nature of the threats that have been
used in order to induce me to enter into it. In other words duress is an example of
‘procedural unfairness’ (on which see 
20.1
). It is therefore suggested that the basis of the
doctrine is correctly located in the lack of consent on the part of the person seeking to
set aside the contract and the wrongful or illegitimate nature of the threats made by the
other party in order to induce entry into the contract. These twin elements are to be
found in all cases of duress, namely duress of the person, duress of goods, and economic
duress.
18.2
 
Duress of the Person
Duress of the person is a well-recognized form of duress and its operation is illustrated
by the following case:
BARTON V. ARMSTRONG
[1976] AC 104, Privy Council
Armstrong and Barton were the major shareholders in a company, Landmark
Corporation Ltd, which was involved in the development of a building estate which
was to be known as ‘Paradise Waters’. Armstrong was the chairman and Barton
was the managing director. They were locked in a power struggle for control of the
company which, over the years, became increasingly bitter. Barton initially
succeeded in obtaining the removal of Armstrong as chairman of the company, and
then negotiations began as to the terms on which Armstrong’s interest was to be
bought out. Armstrong demanded that Landmark repay to him a loan of $400,000
which was stated to be payable forthwith in the event of Armstrong being removed
from the chairmanship of Landmark. Barton hoped to be able to pay off Armstrong
by negotiating a loan from United Dominions Corporation (Australia) Ltd (‘UDC’)
but UDC, despite initial appearances to the contrary, refused to provide the loan. In
these circumstances Barton entered into negotiations with a representative of
Armstrong, and these negotiations resulted in a deed of 17 January 1967 under
which Barton agreed, inter alia, to repay the loan of $400,000, to pay Armstrong
$140,000, and to buy his shares for $180,000. An order for the winding up of
Landmark was made on 11 January 1968 but on 10 January Barton commenced a
suit in equity in which he alleged that he had been coerced by Armstrong into
agreeing to the terms of the deed by threats that he would be murdered and by the
exertion of other unlawful pressure over him. He therefore sought a declaration
that the deed was ‘void’ so far as it concerned him. The trial judge, Street J, found
that Armstrong had indeed threatened Barton and his family, but held that Barton’s
primary and predominant reason for entering into the transaction was a
commercial one, namely to ensure the survival of the company by ridding it of
Armstrong. The Court of Appeal of New South Wales dismissed Barton’s appeal.
Barton appealed to the Privy Council who, by a majority (Lord Wilberforce and
Lord Simon of Glaisdale dissenting), allowed the appeal on the ground that
Armstrong’s threats were a reason for Barton entering into the agreement and that
he was entitled to relief even though he might well have entered into the contract
had Armstrong not threatened him in the way in which he had done. The deeds in
question were therefore declared to be void so far as they concerned Barton.
Lord Cross of Chelsea
[delivering the judgment of the majority of their Lordships]
Their Lordships turn now to consider the question of law which provoked a
difference of opinion in the Court of Appeal Division. It is hardly surprising that
there is no direct authority on the point, for if A threatens B with death if he does
not execute some document and B, who takes A’s threats seriously, executes the
document it can be only in the most unusual circumstances that there can be any
doubt whether the threats operated to induce him to execute the document. But
this is a most unusual case and the findings of fact made below do undoubtedly
raise the question whether it was necessary for Barton in order to obtain 
relief to
establish that he would not have executed the deed in question but for the threats
… There is an obvious analogy between setting aside a disposition for duress or
undue influence and setting it aside for fraud. In each case—to quote the words of
Holmes J in 
Fairbanks
 
v. 
Snow
 
(1887) 13 NE 596, 598—‘the party has been
subjected to an improper motive for action’ … Had Armstrong made a fraudulent
misrepresentation to Barton for the purpose of inducing him to execute the deed of
January 17, 1967, the answer to the problem which has arisen would have been
clear. If it were established that Barton did not allow the representation to affect his
judgment then he could not make it a ground for relief even though the
representation was designed and known by Barton to be designed to affect his
judgment. If on the other hand Barton relied on the misrepresentation Armstrong
could not have defeated his claim to relief by showing that there were other more
weighty causes which contributed to his decision to execute the deed, for in this
field the court does not allow an examination into the relative importance of
contributory causes … Their Lordships think that the same rule should apply in
cases of duress and that if Armstrong’s threats were ‘a’ reason for Barton’s
executing the deed he is entitled to relief even though he might well have entered
into the contract if Armstrong had uttered no threats to induce him to do so.
It remains to apply the law to the facts … If Barton had to establish that he
would not have made the agreement but for Armstrong’s threats, then their
Lordships would not dissent from the view that he had not made out his case. But
no such onus lay on him. On the contrary it was for Armstrong to establish, if he
could, that the threats which he was making and the unlawful pressure which he
was exerting for the purpose of inducing Barton to sign the agreement and which
Barton knew were being made and exerted for this purpose in fact contributed
nothing to Barton’s decision to sign. The judge has found that during the 10 days
or so before the documents were executed Barton was in genuine fear that
Armstrong was planning to have him killed if the agreement was not signed. His
state of mind was described by the judge as one of ‘very real mental torment’ and
he believed that his fears would be at an end when once the documents were
executed. It is true that the judge was not satisfied that Vojinovic [who was alleged
by Barton to have been hired by Armstrong to kill him] had been employed by
Armstrong but if one man threatens another with unpleasant consequences if he
does not act in a particular way, he must take the risk that the impact of his threats
may be accentuated by extraneous circumstances for which he is not in fact
responsible. It is true that on the facts as their Lordships assume them to have
been Armstrong’s threats may have been unnecessary; but it would be unrealistic
to hold that they played no part in making Barton decide to execute the
documents. The proper inference to be drawn from the facts found is, their
Lordships think, that though it may be that Barton would have executed the
documents even if Armstrong had made no threats and exerted no unlawful
pressure to induce him to do so the threats and unlawful pressure in fact
contributed to his decision to sign the documents and to recommend their
execution by Landmark and the other parties to them. It may be, of course, that
Barton’s fear of Armstrong had evaporated before he issued his writ in this action
but Armstrong—understandably enough—expressly disclaimed reliance on the
defence of delay on Barton’s part in repudiating the deed.
In the result therefore the appeal should be allowed and a declaration made
that the deeds in question were executed by Barton under duress and are void so
far as concerns him.
…
Lord Wilberforce and Lord Simon of Glaisdale
[dissenting]
The reason why we do not agree with the majority decision is, briefly, that we
regard the issues in this case as essentially issues of fact, issues moreover of a
character particularly 
within the sphere of the trial judge bearing, as they do, upon
motivation and credibility. On all important issues, clear findings have been made
by Street J and concurred in by the Court of Appeal—either unanimously or by
majority. Accepted rules of practice and, such rules apart, sound principle should,
in our opinion, prevent a second court of appeal from reviewing them in the
absence of some miscarriage of justice, or some manifest and important error of
law or misdirection. In our view no such circumstance exists in this case. Before
stating those findings of fact, which are to our mind conclusive, we think it
desirable to define in our own way the legal basis on which they rest.
The action is one to set aside an apparently complete and valid agreement on
the ground of duress. The basis of the plaintiff’s claim is, thus, that though there
was apparent consent there was no true consent to the agreement: that the
agreement was not voluntary.
This involves consideration of what the law regards as voluntary, or its
opposite; for in life, including the life of commerce and finance, many acts are done
under pressure, sometimes overwhelming pressure, so that one can say that the
actor had no choice but to act. Absence of choice in this sense does not negate
consent in law: for this the pressure must be one of a kind which the law does not
regard as legitimate. Thus, out of the various means by which consent may be
obtained—advice, persuasion, influence, inducement, representation, commercial
pressure—the law has come to select some which it will not accept as a reason for
voluntary action: fraud, abuse of relation of confidence, undue influence, duress or
coercion. In this the law, under the influence of equity, has developed from the old
common law conception of duress—threat to life and limb—and it has arrived at
the modern generalisation expressed by Holmes J—‘subjected to an improper
motive for action’: 
Fairbanks
 
v. 
Snow
, 13 NE Reporter 596, 598.
In an action such as the present, then, the first step required of the plaintiff is to
show that some illegitimate means of persuasion was used. That there were
threats to Barton’s life was found by the judge …
The next necessary step would be to establish the relationship between the
illegitimate means used and the action taken. For the purposes of the present case
(reserving our opinion as to cases which may arise in other contexts) we are
prepared to accept, as the formula most favourable to the appellant, the test
proposed by the majority, namely, that the illegitimate means used was a reason
(not the reason, nor the predominant reason, nor the clinching reason) why the
complainant acted as he did. We are also prepared to accept that a decisive
answer is not obtainable by asking the question whether the contract would have
been made even if there had been no threats because, even if the answer to this
question is affirmative, that does not prove that the contract was not made
because of the threats.
Assuming therefore that what has to be decided is whether the illegitimate
means used was a reason why the complainant acted as he did, it follows that his
reason for acting must (unless the case is one of automatism which this is not) be
a conscious reason so that the complainant can give evidence of it: ‘I acted
because I was forced’. If his evidence is honest and accepted, that will normally
conclude the issue. If, moreover, he gives evidence, it is necessary for the court to
evaluate his evidence by testing it against his credibility and his actions.
In this case Barton gave evidence—his was, for practical purposes, the only
evidence supporting his case. The judge rejected it in important respects and
accepted it in others. The issues as to Barton’s motivations were issues purely of
fact … the findings as to motivation were largely, if not entirely, findings as to
credibility. It would be difficult to find matters more peculiarly than these within the
field of the trial judge who saw both contestants in the box, and who dealt carefully
and at length with the credibility, or lack of credibility, of each of them …
In our opinion the case is far from being one in which a second appellate court
should reverse findings made below and endorsed by a Court of Appeal. Respect
for such findings—particularly where the issues depend so much upon credibility
and an estimate of rival personalities—appears to us to be a central pillar of the
appellate process. It is perhaps otiose, but also fair to the judges below, to say that
we have no ground for thinking that the factual conclusions which they reached
after so prolonged a search did not represent the truth of the situation—or at least
the nearest approximation to truth that was attainable.
We would dismiss the appeal.
Commentary
The primary significance of 
Barton
 
lies in the test applied by the court to determine
whether there was a sufficient causal link between the pressure applied by Armstrong
and Barton’s decision to enter into the agreement on the terms on which he did. It was
held that it sufficed for Barton to prove that the threats were ‘a’ reason which induced
him to execute the deed. The threats did not have to be ‘the’ reason, the ‘predominant’
reason, or the ‘clinching’ reason. This is a very low threshold for a claimant to overcome.
The analogy that was drawn by Lord Cross was with cases of fraudulent
misrepresentation where a similar test is employed. The appropriateness of the analogy
may be doubted. Fraud is a serious matter which must be clearly and distinctly proved
(see 
Derry
 
v. 
Peek
 
(1889) 14 App Cas 337, 
17.5.3
). Duress, on the other hand, has
different shades of wrongdoing. The degree of turpitude in cases of economic duress
may be very much less than the threats to kill that were uttered in 
Barton
. It is therefore
not surprising to find that in cases of economic duress there is authority which supports
the existence of a more exacting causal requirement, namely that the threat must have
been a ‘significant’ cause of the claimant’s decision to enter into the contract (on which
see further 
18.4.1
).
The second point that is worth noting is that the Privy Council was content to accept the
submission of counsel for Barton that the effect of duress was to render the deed ‘void’
as far as he was concerned. This is contrary to the generally accepted view which is that
the effect of duress is to render the contract voidable (that is to say it remains valid until
it has been set aside). It is not clear why the Privy Council acceded to the submission
that duress rendered the deed ‘void’. It may be that the point was never argued and that
the assumption made that the deed was void was simply incorrect (it is certainly very
difficult to reconcile with subsequent authority). There is, however, another possible
view. It depends upon the conceptual foundation of duress. If it is the case that duress
can rest on the absence of consent on the part of the party seeking to set aside the
contract (or, as the case may be, the deed) then it becomes more plausible to argue that
absence of consent can render a contract void. The difficulty with this argument is that
in cases such as 
Universe Tankships of Monrovia
 
v. 
International Transport Workers’
Federation (The Universe Sentinel)
 
[1983] 1 AC 366 and 
Dimskal Shipping Co SA
 
v.
International Transport Workers’ Federation (The Evia Luck)
 
[1992] 2 AC 152 the
House of Lords implicitly rejected the proposition that there is an absence of consent in
duress cases. This being the case, duress renders a contract voidable rather than void.
The final point to note regarding 
Barton
 
relates to the illegitimacy of the pressure
exerted by Armstrong. It was not necessary for their Lordships to consider the meaning
of ‘illegitimacy’ given that a threat to kill someone is self-evidently illegitimate. A claim
of duress of the person must be founded on a threat to the physical health or well-being
of the claimant or a member of his or her family (and physical well-being should extend
to threats 
of imprisonment). If, however, the threat is one that relates to the economic
well-being of the claimant, such as a threat of financial ruin, it is not a case of duress of
the person but of economic duress (
Holyoake
 
v. 
Candy
 
[2017] EWHC 3397 (Ch), [233]).
Given that the causal link required for duress of the person appears to be lower than that
applicable to claims of economic duress (see earlier), the classification of the claim as
either a case of duress of the person or economic duress may be a matter of some
practical significance.
18.3
 
Duress of Goods
The law relating to duress of goods has struggled for recognition. For many years, the
courts held that the unlawful detention of another’s goods did not constitute duress. The
principal authority for this proposition was:
SKEATE V. BEALE
(1841) 11 Ad & E 983, Court of King’s Bench
The plaintiff distrained for arrears of rent, claiming that £19 10s was due from the
defendant. The defendant agreed that, if the distress was withdrawn, he would pay
£3 7s immediately and the outstanding £16 2s 6d within a month. He failed to pay
the sum so promised and the plaintiff sued to recover the outstanding amount. The
defendant argued that the seizure had been wrongful as the only sum due was £3
7s 6d and that he entered into the agreement only to prevent the plaintiff from
carrying out his threat to sell the goods. It was held that the defendant was not
entitled to set aside the transaction and that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment
for the sum claimed.
Lord Denman CJ
[delivering the judgment of the court]
We consider the law to be clear, and founded on good reason, that an
agreement is not void because made under duress of goods. There is no
distinction in this respect between a deed and an agreement not under seal; and,
with regard to the former, the law is laid down … and the distinction pointed out
between duress of, or menace to, the person, and duress of goods. The former is a
constraining force, which not only takes away the free agency, but may leave no
room for appeal to the law for a remedy: a man, therefore, is not bound by the
agreement which he enters into under such circumstances: but the fear that goods
may be taken or injured does not deprive any one of his free agency who
possesses that ordinary degree of firmness which the law requires all to exert. It is
not necessary now to enter into the consideration of cases in which it has been
held that money paid to redeem goods wrongfully seized, or to prevent their
wrongful seizure, may be recovered back in an action for money had and received:
for the distinction between those cases and the present, which must be taken to be
that of an agreement, not compulsorily but voluntarily entered into, is obvious.
Lindon
 
v. 
Hooper
 
(1 Cowp 414), and 
Knibbs
 
v. 
Hall
 
(1 Esp 84), are, however,
authorities to shew that, even if the money had been paid in this case, instead of
the agreement to pay it entered into, no action for money had and received could
have been sustained by the now defendant. For, although there is a difference in
the circumstances, and, the distress having 
been made, and some rent admitted to
be in arrear, no replevin could have been successfully made, yet if the plaintiff
distrained goods of the value of 20l. when little more than 3l. were due, there is no
doubt that, on payment of the value of the goods, or the sum claimed, an action
would have lain for the excessive distress. And it is of great importance that parties
should be holden to those remedies for injuries which the law prescribes, rather
than allowed to enter into agreements with a view to prevent them, intending at the
time not to keep their contracts. In the argument for the defendant, reliance was
placed on the facts that the agreement was entered into under protest, and that the
plaintiff must have known that only the smaller amount of rent was due. It is
unnecessary to consider what the effect of these would have been; for neither of
them is alleged in the plea. As, therefore, this plea relies solely on the menace as
to the goods, under which the agreement was made, for avoiding it, we think it
discloses no answer to the declaration …
Commentary
While the unlawful detention of another’s goods did not constitute duress, there was at
the same time authority to support the proposition that money paid to release goods
which had been unlawfully detained could be recovered. Authority for the latter
proposition is 
Astley
 
v. 
Reynolds
 
(1731) 2 Str 915. The plaintiff pawned a plate to the
defendant for £20. Three years later the defendant refused to allow the plaintiff to
redeem the plate unless he paid him interest of £10. The plaintiff tendered £4 but the
defendant refused to accept it and refused to release the plate. The plaintiff eventually
paid the £10 in order to get his plate back, and then brought an action to recover the
excess which he had paid over the legal interest which the defendant was entitled to
charge. It was held that the plaintiff was entitled to the recovery of the money so paid
under compulsion. Holt CJ stated (at p. 916):
We think … that this is a payment by compulsion; the plaintiff might have such an immediate want of his goods,
that an action of trover would not do his business: where the rule volenti non fit injuria is applied, it must be
where the party had his freedom of exercising his will, which this man had not: we must take it he paid the
money relying on his legal remedy to get it back again.
As the editors of Goff and Jones have pointed out (
The Law of Unjust Enrichment
 
(9th
edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2016), para 10–39), the decisions in 
Skeate
 
and 
Astley
 
require a
distinction to be drawn between the following two cases:
[I]f A demands a sum of money from B under duress of goods, and B pays the money, then he can recover it; yet
if B makes a promise to pay a sum of money under similar duress from A, then provided that there is some
consideration for the promise, B is bound to pay the money.
The editors of Goff and Jones continue (at para 10–40):
It is logically very difficult to support a distinction of this kind, since there must have been a 
scintilla temporis
when A must have agreed to pay before making the payment. In 
Skeate
 
Lord Denman CJ justified the rule on
the ground that, whereas duress to the person is a 
‘constraining force’, ‘the fear that goods may be taken or
injured does not deprive anyone of his free agency who possesses that ordinary degree of firmness which the
law requires all to exert’. But this requirement of bravery has surely now been abandoned. In fact, the rule in
Skeate
 
is in direct conflict with the modern view of duress, namely, that where a transaction has been entered
into as a result of illegitimate pressure, consent has not been freely given and the transaction is voidable … the
current law is that an agreement induced by duress of goods is voidable at the instance of the coerced party, so
that any money paid thereunder will be recoverable in an action for unjust enrichment.
Authority for the proposition that 
Skeate
 
v. 
Beale
 
is no longer good law is to be found in
the speech of Lord Goff in 
Dimskal Shipping Co SA
 
v. 
International Transport Workers’
Federation (The Evia Luck)
 
[1992] 2 AC 152 (
18.4.1
).
18.4
 
Economic Duress
As has been noted (
18.1
), economic duress was a late arrival in English law, not being
formally recognized until the decision of Kerr J in 
Occidental Worldwide Investment
Corporation
 
v. 
Skibs A/S Avanti (The Siboen and The Sibotre)
 
[1976] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 293.
Since then it has had a somewhat chequered career. One of the principal difficulties has
been in identifying the elements that have to be proved in order to make out a case of
economic duress. However, the stage has now been reached in the development of
economic duress where the principal elements of economic duress have been
authoritatively determined. Lord Burrows in 
Pakistan International Airline
Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK) Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3 WLR 727, [78]–[79]
(see 
18.1
) identified the three essential elements to an economic duress claim, namely (i)
a threat or pressure exerted by the defendant that is illegitimate, (ii) that illegitimate
threat or pressure caused the claimant to enter into the contract, and (iii) the claimant
must have had no reasonable alternative to giving in to the threat or pressure. Of these
elements the most difficult is the identification of pressure or threats that are for this
purpose ‘illegitimate.’ We shall therefore postpone the discussion of the meaning of
‘illegitimate’ until after our examination of the other two essential elements of economic
duress.
18.4.1
 
Causation
In his judgment in 
Pakistan International Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK)
Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3 WLR 727, [78] Lord Burrows, when discussing the test
that is to be applied when seeking to determine whether there is a sufficient causal link
between the illegitimate pressure or threat and the decision of the claimant to enter into
the contract, quoted from the judgment of Lord Goff in 
Dimskal Shipping Co SA
 
v.
International Transport Workers’ Federation (The Evia Luck) (No 2)
 
[1992] 2 AC 152,
165. A slightly fuller extract from the judgment of Lord Goff captures the essence of his
judgment on this issue:
It was at one time thought that, at common law, the only form of duress which would entitle a party to avoid a
contract on that ground was duress of the person. The origin for this 
view lay in the decision of the Court of
Exchequer in 
Skeate
 
v. 
Beale
 
(1841) 11 Ad & El 983. However, since the decisions of Kerr J in 
Occidental
Worldwide Investment Corporation
 
v. 
Skibs A/S Avanti (The Siboen and The Sibotre)
 
[1976] 1 Lloyd’s Rep
293, of Mocatta J in 
North Ocean Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
Hyundai Construction Co Ltd
 
[1979] QB 705, and of the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 
Pao On
 
v. 
Lau Yiu Long
 
[1980] AC 614, that limitation has been
discarded; and it is now accepted that economic pressure may be sufficient to amount to duress for this
purpose, provided at least that the economic pressure may be characterised as illegitimate and has constituted a
significant cause inducing the plaintiff to enter into the relevant contract (see 
Barton
 
v. 
Armstrong
 
[1976] AC
104, 121, per Lord Wilberforce and Lord Simon of Glaisdale (referred to with approval in 
Pao On
 
v. 
Lau Yiu
Long
 
[1980] AC 614, 635, per Lord Scarman) and 
Crescendo Management Pty. Ltd
 
v. 
Westpac Banking
Corporation
 
(1988) 19 NSWLR 40, 46, per McHugh JA). It is sometimes suggested that the plaintiff’s will must
have been coerced so as to vitiate his consent. This approach has been the subject of criticism; see Beatson, 
The
Use and Abuse of Unjust Enrichment
 
(1991), 113–17; and the notes by Professor Atiyah in (1982) 98 
LQR
 
197–
202, and by Professor Birks in [1990] 3 
LMCLQ
 
342–51. I myself, like McHugh JA, doubt whether it is helpful
in this context to speak of the plaintiff’s will having been coerced. It is not however necessary to explore the
matter in the present case.
Two points should be noted here. The first relates to Lord Goff’s comments concerning
the coercion of the will theory and his apparent approval of the criticisms that have been
levelled against that theory. The second point relates to his insertion of the word
‘significant’ before ‘cause’. The addition of ‘significant’ is important and is to be
contrasted with the approach taken in 
Barton
 
v. 
Armstrong
 
[1976] AC 104 (on which
see 
18.2
) where it was held that the pressure need only be ‘a’ cause of the decision to
enter into the contract. Why does the law appear to differentiate in this way between
cases of duress of the person and cases of economic duress?
It is at least clear that the test for causation in cases of economic duress is more
stringent than that adopted in the context of duress of the person. The more difficult
question relates to the extent of that difference and whether a ‘significant cause’ test
differs from the traditional ‘but for’ test. In many ways it would be more straightforward
were the courts to conclude that a ‘significant cause’ is, for this purpose, to be equated
with the ‘but for’ test (a view which derives support from the judgment of Christopher
Clarke J in 
Kolmar Group AG
 
v. 
Traxpo Enterprises Pty Ltd
 
[2010] EWHC 113
(Comm), [2010] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 653, [92]). On the other hand, as Mance J observed in
Huyton SA v Peter Cremer GmbH & Co
 
[1999] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 620, 636–9, a simple
application of the ‘but for’ test ‘could lead too readily to relief being granted’. But it is
important to note that Mance J also had regard to the other elements of an economic
duress claim, in particular the availability of alternative forms of redress. Thus it may be
that it is these other elements that will keep the doctrine of economic duress within
reasonable bounds and that there is no need to depart from the more traditional ‘but for’
test in this context. An alternative approach would be to avoid drawing hard-and-fast
lines in this area, leaving it to the courts to apply a sliding scale according to which the
causal threshold diminishes as the degree of illegitimacy increases (so that threats to kill
are at one end of the spectrum, where the causal requirement is at its lowest, and cases
of economic duress at the other). The difficulty with the latter approach is that it leads to
uncertainty and so for this reason it may be preferable to apply the ‘but for’ test to cases
of economic duress. The point does, however, await authoritative resolution.
18.4.2
 
The Lack of Reasonable Alternatives
In his judgment in 
Pakistan International Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK)
Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3 WLR 727, [79] (see 
18.1
) Lord Burrows referred to the
requirement that the claimant must have had no reasonable alternative to giving in to
the threat (or pressure). As he observed, it would appear that this requirement is
applicable to cases of economic duress but not to other forms of duress (thus further
emphasizing the differences that exist between cases of economic duress and other
forms of duress). One of the authorities which he cited in support of this requirement
was the judgment of Lord Saville, giving the judgment of the Privy Council in 
Borrelli
 
v.
Ting
 
[2010] UKPC 21, [35], where he stated:
The Board is of the view that in the present case the Liquidators entered into the Settlement Agreement as the
result of the illegitimate means employed by James Henry Ting, namely by opposing the scheme for no good
reason and in using forgery and false evidence in support of that opposition, all in order to prevent the
Liquidators from investigating his conduct of the affairs of Akai Holdings Ltd or making claims against him
arising out of that conduct. As the Board has already observed, by adopting these means James Henry Ting left
the Liquidators with no reasonable or practical alternative but to enter into the Settlement Agreement.
A case which illustrates the role that the lack of reasonable alternatives can play in cases
of alleged economic duress is provided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
B & S
Contracts and Design Ltd
 
v. 
Victor Green Publications Ltd
 
[1984] ICR 419. The
plaintiffs agreed to erect stands at Olympia for the defendants but they experienced
difficulties with their workforce, who refused to erect the stands unless they were paid
£9,000 in severance pay. The plaintiffs offered to pay the workmen £4,500 but this offer
was rejected. When the defendants were informed of these difficulties, they offered to
provide the plaintiffs with an advance of £4,500 but this offer was also rejected by the
plaintiffs. The plaintiffs informed the defendants that they would be unable to perform
the contract unless their workforce could be persuaded to stay at work. In these
circumstances one of the defendants’ directors said to the plaintiffs’ finance director
‘Well, you have me over a barrel’ and so the defendants paid £4,500 to the plaintiffs.
The defendants then deducted the £4,500 from the final sum due to the plaintiffs. The
plaintiffs responded by suing the defendants for £4,500. The defendants resisted the
claim on the ground that the money had been paid under duress. The Court of Appeal
held that the money had indeed been paid under duress so that the defendants were not
liable to pay the £4,500 demanded by the plaintiffs. The clearest articulation of the
significance of the lack of reasonable available alternatives is to be found in the
judgment of Kerr LJ who stated:
I … bear in mind that a threat to break a contract unless money is paid by the other party can, but by no means
always will, constitute duress. It appears from the authorities that it will only constitute duress if the
consequences of a refusal would be serious and immediate so that there is no reasonable alternative open, such
as by legal redress, obtaining an injunction, etc … There was no other practical choice open to the defendants in
the present case, and accordingly I agree that this is a case where money has been paid under duress, which was
accordingly recoverable by the defendants provided they acted promptly as they did, and which they have
recovered by deducting it from the contract price …
Support for the significance of the lack of reasonable available alternatives can also be
gleaned from the judgment of Griffiths LJ in the same case who stated that the
defendants 
were in an ‘impossible position’ and that if they had not paid the £4,500 they
would have ‘caused grave damage to their reputation’ and might have exposed
themselves to heavy claims in damages from exhibitors who had leased space at the
exhibitions.
It is important to observe the role that a lack of a reasonable alternative plays in the case
law. It is but one element in the inquiry. Thus a claimant who proves that he had no
other option open to him but to agree to the terms proposed by the defendant will not be
able thereby to establish a case of duress, at least where the defendant has not applied
any illegitimate pressure. It is for this reason that a person who sells his house for a low
price because he concludes that he has no alternative open to him but to sell at the
proposed price cannot set aside the contract on the ground of duress. However, the
reasonable alternative requirement assumes significance in the case where the claimant
does have a reasonable alternative open to it, but decides not to take it. So on the facts of
B & S Contracts and Design
 
matters might have been different had the defendants had
the time available to them in order to go off to court in order to contest the validity of
the plaintiffs’ demand, or had they been able lawfully to terminate the contract with the
plaintiffs and obtain performance elsewhere. In such circumstances, the presence of a
reasonable alternative might have prevented them from making good their claim that
they had only agreed to pay the £4,500 under duress.
18.4.3
 
Illegitimate Pressure
When is a threat or the application of pressure ‘illegitimate’ for the purposes of the law
relating to economic duress? In 
R
 
v. 
Attorney-General for England and Wales
 
[2003]
UKPC 22, [16] Lord Hoffmann, giving the judgment of the Privy Council, stated:
16. The legitimacy of the pressure must be examined from two aspects: first, the nature of the pressure and
secondly, the nature of the demand which the pressure is applied to support: see Lord Scarman in the 
Universe
Tankships
 
case, at p. 401. Generally speaking, the threat of any form of unlawful action will be regarded as
illegitimate. On the other hand, the fact that the threat is lawful does not necessarily make the pressure
legitimate. As Lord Atkin said in 
Thorne
 
v. 
Motor Trade Association
 
[1937] AC 797, 806:
‘The ordinary blackmailer normally threatens to do what he has a perfect right to do—namely,
communicate some compromising conduct to a person whose knowledge is likely to affect the person
threatened … What he has to justify is not the threat, but the demand of money.’
Lord Hoffmann thus appeared to envisage a two-stage approach to illegitimacy. First, if
the threat or the pressure is unlawful, it will generally be illegitimate. Secondly, where
the threat is lawful but is used to support a demand which amounts to blackmail, it will
also be regarded as illegitimate. In this section we shall examine the approach of the
courts to the identification of illegitimate pressure or threats in two contexts. The first is
where the threat takes the form of a threatened breach of contract. The second is where
the threat is to do something which the defendant is entitled to do. Both issues have
given rise to difficulty, but the second of them has proved to be particularly difficult and
it was the subject of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in 
Pakistan International
Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK) Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3 WLR 727.
First, however, we will deal with those cases in which the illegitimate pressure is said to
take the form of a threatened breach of contract.
18.4.3.1
 
Illegitimate Pressure and Threats to Breach a
Contract
Where the threat made, or pressure applied, by the defendant takes the form of a threat
to commit an unlawful act, such as a crime or a tort, the courts have generally
experienced no difficulty in concluding that such a threat is ‘illegitimate’ (see, for
example, 
Universe Tankships of Monrovia
 
v. 
International Transport Workers’
Federation (The Universe Sentinel)
 
[1983] 1 AC 366). More problematic is the case
where the pressure or threat assumes the form of a threatened breach of contract.
A breach of contract is not unlawful in the sense that it amounts to a crime. A breach of
contract will only rarely involve the commission of a criminal offence. But a breach of
contract is a civil wrong (as is the commission of a tort) so that a party who threatens to
breach a contract is threatening to do something which it is not lawfully entitled to do.
On this basis one might expect a threatened breach of contract always to be classified as
an illegitimate threat for the purposes of economic duress. On the other hand, there are
some signs of a reluctance to conclude that all threatened breaches of contract are
illegitimate, particularly in the case where the party issuing the threat believed in all
good faith that it was entitled to make the demand which it made. It is not uncommon
for there to be some uncertainty as to the correct interpretation of the contract (see
generally 
Chapter 11
). In such a case there may be a genuine doubt as to whether or not
the defendant was entitled to make the threat which it made. If the matter is
subsequently litigated, and a court determines that the defendant was mistaken in its
interpretation of the contract so that it was in fact threatening to breach the contract
between the parties, does it automatically follow in such a case that the threat made is
an illegitimate one? On one view the answer is that it should automatically follow
because the existence of a breach of contract does not generally depend upon the good
faith or bad faith of the party who is said to be in breach. Given that the presence of
good faith on the part of the party said to be in breach is not a defence to the claim that
the contract has been breached, why should it be a relevant factor when considering
whether the threat is ‘illegitimate’? On the other hand, there is a concern that a
conclusion that all threatened breaches of contract are illegitimate could make it more
difficult for parties to renegotiate a contract because of the fear that a bona fide attempt
to defend one’s own position could subsequently be characterized as the application of
illegitimate pressure.
An early case in which a court was required to consider whether a threatened breach of
contract amounted to the application of economic duress is the decision of Mocatta J in
the following case:
NORTH OCEAN SHIPPING CO LTD V. HYUNDAI
CONSTRUCTION CO LTD (THE ATLANTIC BARON)
[1979] QB 705, Queen’s Bench Division
In 1972 the defendants entered into a contract under which they agreed to
construct a tanker for the plaintiffs. The contract stated that the price, which was to
be paid in US dollars, was not to be subject to adjustment except in certain specific
circumstances (which did not occur). In June 1973, after the devaluation of the
dollar by 10 per cent, the defendants demanded that they be paid an extra 10 per
cent for the work done under the contract. The plaintiffs refused to pay the money
so demanded on the ground that there was no basis in law for the demand, and
they suggested that the matter be referred to arbitration. The defendants refused to
agree to this suggestion and they threatened to terminate the contract if the sum
was not paid. The plaintiffs were advised that the defendants were not entitled to
make such a demand under the terms of the contract but, as a result of an
advantageous 
sub-contract into which they had entered, they were anxious to
obtain delivery of the tanker at the agreed time, and so they promised to pay the
extra sum demanded. They paid the additional 10 per cent on each of the
remaining instalments, and the ship was delivered to the plaintiffs in November
1974. In July 1975 the plaintiffs sought to recover the extra 10 per cent on the
ground that there was no consideration for their payment and that they had agreed
to make the payment only when subject to duress. The court held that there was
consideration to support the agreement but that the plaintiffs had entered into the
contract as a result of duress. However the plaintiffs were held not to be entitled to
set aside the contract because they had affirmed the contract by making the final
payments without protest and by their delay in making their claim for repayment.
Mocatta J
[Having reached the conclusion that there was consideration for the agreement
turned to consider whether it should be set aside on the ground of economic
duress.]
Before proceeding further it may be useful to summarise the conclusions I have
so far reached. First, I do not take the view that the recovery of money paid under
duress other than to the person is necessarily limited to duress to goods falling
within one of the categories hitherto established by the English cases. … Secondly,
from this it follows that the compulsion may take the form of ‘economic duress’ if
the necessary facts are proved. A threat to break a contract may amount to such
‘economic duress’. Thirdly, if there has been such a form of duress leading to a
contract for consideration, I think that contract is a voidable one which can be
avoided and the excess money paid under it recovered.
I think the facts found in this case do establish that the agreement to increase
the price by 10% reached at the end of June 1973 was caused by what may be
called ‘economic duress’. The Yard were adamant in insisting on the increased
price without having any legal justification for so doing and the owners realised that
the Yard would not accept anything other than an unqualified agreement to the
increase. The owners might have claimed damages in arbitration against the Yard
with all the inherent unavoidable uncertainties of litigation, but in view of the
position of the Yard vis-à-vis their relations with Shell it would be unreasonable to
hold that this is the course they should have taken: see 
Astley
 
v. 
Reynolds
 
(1731)
2 Str 915. The owners made a very reasonable offer of arbitration coupled with
security for any award in the Yard’s favour that might be made, but this was
refused. They then made their agreement, which can truly I think be said to have
been made under compulsion, by the telex of June 28 without prejudice to their
rights. I do not consider the Yard’s ignorance of the Shell charter material. It may
well be that had they known of it they would have been even more exigent. …
The owners were … free from the duress on November 27, 1974, and took no
action by way of protest or otherwise between their important telex of June 28,
1973, and their formal claim for the return of the excess 10% paid of July 30, 1975.
… I have come to the conclusion that … the correct inference to draw, taking an
objective view of the facts, is that the action and inaction of the owners can only be
regarded as an affirmation of the variation in June 1973 of the terms of the original
contract by the agreement to pay the additional 10 per cent.
Commentary
In this case, decided at an early stage in the development of economic duress, one can
see clear authority for the proposition that a threatened breach of contract can
constitute economic duress. In reaching the conclusion that the agreement to pay the
higher sum was 
caused by economic duress, Mocatta J did not ask himself whether or
not the defendants were in bad faith in demanding that the plaintiffs pay an extra 10 per
cent. The fact that he did not ask the question suggests that, for him, it was not a
relevant consideration. Further, it can be said that the present case demonstrates that it
may be no easy task to define ‘bad faith’ in this context. It could be said that the
defendants were in bad faith in that they knew that they were not entitled to the extra 10
per cent. On the other hand, they had what might be called a ‘good reason’ for
demanding the extra money on the basis that they were simply attempting to cover
themselves against devaluation of the dollar: they were not seeking to exploit any
vulnerability on the part of the plaintiffs.
Subsequent cases have confirmed the validity of the proposition that a threatened
breach of contract will generally amount to the application of illegitimate pressure (see,
for example, 
Universe Tankships of Monrovia
 
v. 
International Transport Workers’
Federation (The Universe Sentinel)
 
[1983] 1 AC 366, 
Atlas Express Ltd
 
v. 
Kafco
 
[1989]
QB 833, and 
Carillion Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Felix (UK) Ltd
 
[2001] BLR 1) but they have
stopped short of affirming that it will always do so. Further, there are cases in which the
defendant appeared to threaten to breach its contract with the claimant but the court
nevertheless concluded that there had been no duress on the facts. These cases may,
however, be explicable on grounds other than the illegitimacy of the threat. Thus in
Williams
 
v. 
Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 1 (see 
5.2.2.3.2
) there
does not seem to have been any ‘threat’ made by the plaintiff to break the contract given
that the offer to pay more for the completion of the work appeared to have been made
voluntarily by the defendant at a meeting between the parties. A second case in which
there was found to be no economic duress is 
DSDN Subsea Ltd
 
v. 
Petroleum Geo-
Services ASA
 
[2000] BLR 530, [131], where Dyson J included among the factors to be
taken into account by a court when determining whether there has been illegitimate
pressure ‘whether the person allegedly exerting the pressure has acted in good or bad
faith’. However, on the facts of the case, the threat to break the contract did not seem to
have been a significant cause of the decision to enter into the contract, given the lack of
contemporaneous evidence to substantiate the claim that economic duress had been
exercised and so the case may properly be explained on the latter ground and it did not
therefore turn on the presence or absence of good faith.
The current state of the law was, perhaps, best summed up by Christopher Clarke J in
Kolmar Group AG
 
v. 
Traxpo Enterprises Pty Ltd
 
[2010] EWHC 113 (Comm), [2010] 2
Lloyd’s Rep 653, [92], when he stated that ‘a threat to break a contract will generally be
regarded as illegitimate, particularly where the defendant must know that it would be in
breach of contract if the threat were implemented’. The words ‘generally’ and
‘particularly’ are important here. ‘Generally’ suggests that there is no absolute rule and
that it may be necessary to have regard to the facts and circumstances of the individual
case. ‘Particularly’ is noteworthy in so far as it identifies the case in which a threatened
breach of contract is most likely to be illegitimate, namely in the case where the
defendant knows that it is not entitled to make the threat that it has made. This leaves
the difficult case of the party who genuinely but incorrectly believed that it was entitled
to make the threat which it made. Cases such as 
The Atlantic Baron
 
suggest that good
faith on the part of the defendant should not prevent a court from concluding that the
pressure was illegitimate and this view derives support from the fact that, as has been
noted, English law does not generally distinguish between a good faith and a bad faith
breach of contract. On this basis it is suggested that a threatened breach of contract
should generally constitute the application of illegitimate pressure, although the
possibility cannot be ruled out that a court, in an exceptional case, may conclude that
the pressure applied was not illegitimate when account is taken of the fact that the
defendant acted in good faith in making the demand which it made.
The Atlantic Baron
 
is also significant in so far as it demonstrates that a party who
wishes to rely on economic duress in order to set aside an agreement should act quickly
once freed from the duress. A party who is dilatory in making a complaint of duress is
likely to be held to have affirmed the contract. This leads on to the third point which is
that Mocatta J concluded that duress rendered the contract voidable, and not ‘void’ as in
Barton
 
v. 
Armstrong
 
(
18.2
). It is now generally accepted that economic duress renders a
contract voidable and not void.
Finally, the case underlines the link between consideration and duress (on which see
The Atlantic Baron
)
 
in that the first point taken by the plaintiffs was that there was no
consideration for their promise to pay an extra 10 per cent. Mocatta J found that
consideration had been supplied but would have set the contract aside on the ground of
duress had the plaintiffs not affirmed the contract. This might be said to be an example
of duress being used as the more appropriate regulator of contract modifications.
18.4.3.2
 
Lawful Act Duress
Perhaps the most difficult issue in the law of economic duress is the question whether
English law should recognize a doctrine of lawful act duress. This was the issue at the
heart of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in 
Pakistan International Airline
Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK) Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3 WLR 727.
On the facts of the case the claimant travel agents sought to set aside an agreement into
which it had entered with the defendant airline company (‘PIAC’). The claimant’s
business consisted almost entirely of the sale to the local Pakistani community of air
tickets for travel to Pakistan and at the relevant time PIAC was the only operator who
provided direct flights between the UK and Pakistan. Following a dispute between PIAC
and a number of its agents over the non-payment of commission to the agents, PIAC
gave notice to terminate its existing agency contracts and it offered to its agents new
contracts on terms that the agents waived their existing claims against PIAC for unpaid
commission. In giving notice to terminate the existing contract and in offering new
terms to the claimant, PIAC was acting lawfully. The claimant accepted the terms
proposed by PIAC but subsequently brought proceedings to set aside the agreement on
the ground that it had entered into the new agreement as a result of the application by
PIAC of economic duress and it sought to recover from PIAC the unpaid commission
under its previous agency contract with PIAC. It was held by the Supreme Court that the
claimant was not entitled to set aside the agreement on the ground of economic duress.
There are two principal aspects to the decision of the Supreme Court. The first relates to
the question whether or not English law recognizes a doctrine of lawful act duress. The
Supreme Court unanimously answered this question in the affirmative. The second
aspect relates to the scope of the doctrine of lawful act duress. On this issue there was
some common ground between the Justices of the Supreme Court but it was also an
issue on which the Supreme Court divided. The majority judgment was given by Lord
Hodge, with whom Lord Reed, Lord Lloyd-Jones, and Lord Kitchin expressed their
agreement. The minority judgment on the issues where the court divided was given by
Lord Burrows (although it is important to note that Lord Hodge expressed his
agreement with the judgment of Lord Burrows on a number of issues and on these
issues the judgment of Lord Burrows has the support of the entire court and so
represents the judgment of the court). It is also worth noting that, while the context for
the consideration of lawful act duress was a case of alleged economic duress, the
judgments of the Supreme Court extend beyond economic duress and take account of a
broader range of circumstances in which the exercise of lawful act duress may entitle a
party to set aside a contract.
Our analysis will proceed in four stages. At the first stage (
18.4.3.2.1
) consideration will
be given to the question whether English law recognizes a doctrine of lawful act duress.
At the second stage (
18.4.3.2.2
) attention will switch to the scope of lawful act duress in
English law and to those issues relating to the scope of lawful act duress which were
unanimously agreed by the Supreme Court. The third stage (
18.4.3.2.3
) is the most
difficult stage and it consists of an analysis of the grounds on which the Supreme Court
diverged in relation to the scope of lawful act duress. The fourth and final stage
(
18.4.3.2.4
) will offer some concluding observations.
18.4.3.2.1
 
Does Lawful Act Duress Exist?
The judgment of the Supreme Court on the issue of whether or not English law
recognizes a doctrine of lawful act duress was given by Lord Burrows, with whom Lord
Hodge and the other judges in the Supreme Court expressed their agreement. Lord
Burrows stated:
82. Lawful act duress is controversial. This is essentially because many contracts are entered into under some
form of pressure exerted by the other party and, plainly, one would not wish to undermine all such contracts.
An insistence that the threat must be one to do something unlawful draws a clear line with a standard that is
easily understood and can easily be applied. But once one crosses that line to include threats of lawful acts, it is
not easy to distinguish between threats that will count as duress and threats that will not. Peter Birks, in 
An
Introduction to the Law of Restitution
, revised ed (1989), at p 177, expressed this difficulty as follows:
‘Can lawful pressures also count? This is a difficult question, because, if the answer is that they can, the
only viable basis for discriminating between acceptable and unacceptable pressures is not positive law but
social morality. In other words, the judges must say what pressures … are improper as contrary to
prevailing standards. That makes the judges, not the law or the legislature, the arbiters of social
evaluation.’
. …
83.
 
The fear of wide-ranging disruption and uncertainty, particularly for commercial parties, has led some
distinguished commentators to argue that lawful act duress should not exist. …
85.
 
I am also conscious that lawful act duress has been rejected by the Court of Appeal of New South Wales
in 
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd
 
v. 
Karam
 
[2005] NSWCA 344; (2005) 64 NSWLR 149
(albeit that one needs to be careful in making comparisons given that particular statutory interventions in that
jurisdiction may be thought relevant). …
86.
 
Despite that support for the non-recognition or abolition of lawful act duress, it is my view (as it was the
view of Birks in the continuation of the passage cited in para 82 above) that lawful act duress does, and should,
exist as a ground for rescinding a contract (or for the restitution of non-contractual payments) in English law.
There are three reasons for this.
87.
 
The first reason is that, although the facts of the leading cases of 
The Universe Sentinel
 
and 
The Evia
Luck (No 2)
 
concerned alleged unlawful act duress—by threats to commit a tort in the context of the ‘blacking’
of ships sailing under flags of convenience—the House of Lords chose to use the language of the pressure
needing to be ‘illegitimate’ not ‘unlawful’. …
88.
 
The second reason is that the crime of blackmail, which is contained in section 21 of the Theft Act 1968,
clearly includes threats of lawful action. … Classic examples of (the actus reus of) blackmail involving lawful
threats would be a threat by A, unless money is 
paid by B, to reveal true information about B to a newspaper or
to B’s family or to the police. Although the link between the crime of blackmail and lawful act duress has to be
very carefully handled to avoid circularity—this is best done by excluding the possibility of the crime of
blackmail having been committed when considering what counts as lawful act duress—it would be very odd for
the civil law of duress not to include threats of lawful acts when the criminal law of blackmail does so. Lord
Scarman expressly drew an analogy with blackmail in 
The Universe Sentinel
 
at p 401. …
89.
 
The third reason is that there have been several cases—and not just recent cases—in which it has been
accepted that threats of lawful action should entitle the threatened party (the claimant) to rescind a contract (or
to have the restitution of non-contractual payments). A long-established area, although traditionally thought of
as within the equitable doctrine of undue influence rather than the common law doctrine of duress, has
comprised illegitimate threats to prosecute the claimant or a member of the claimant’s family. These were not
economic duress cases. Rather the threats in question were threats to reputation or emotional threats. But the
important point is that (avoiding the circularity of blackmail: see the previous paragraph), the threats in
question were threats to do lawful acts. So, for example, in 
Williams
 
v. 
Bayley
 
1 HL 200 a father agreed to pay
promissory notes in favour of a bank (secured by a charge over his property) in order to avert the bank’s implied
threat to prosecute his son for forging his signature on the notes. As a separate ground from the contract being
‘illegal’ (as stifling a criminal prosecution) it was held that the contract was invalid as it had been procured by
undue influence. And in 
Mutual Finance Ltd
 
v. 
John Wetton and Sons Ltd
 
[1937] 2 KB 389 a guarantee of
payment to the claimant company was signed by Percy Wetton on behalf of the defendant company in order to
avert the claimant company’s implied threat to prosecute Joseph Wetton (Percy’s brother) for forgery in
acquiring a lorry on hire purchase. Percy Wetton signed the agreement for fear that prosecution of his brother
would kill their father who was very ill. Porter J distinguished duress at common law, which he regarded as
being confined to duress of the person, but held that the contract here was voidable for undue influence. See
also, for example, 
Kaufman
 
v. 
Gerson
 
[1904] 1 KB 591.
90.
 
Although these cases may have used the language of undue influence, it is clear that they were not
concerned with the standard case of undue influence where the relationship between the parties is such that one
party’s judgment is not being exercised freely and independently of the other party. That standard area of
‘relational’ undue influence was not in issue in those cases. Rather one was looking at actual undue influence
where the influence was being exerted by a lawful threat. At the time of those cases, and prior to the
development of economic duress in the 1970s, common law duress was thought to be confined to duress of the
person or, in the context of the restitution of non-contractual payments, duress of goods. The threats in
question in those cases were not ones of physical violence or detainment or to seize or retain goods. They
therefore fell outside those two categories of common law duress. But now that economic duress has been
recognised at common law, there is no reason to hive off those earlier cases from duress by labelling them as
cases on undue influence. On the contrary, the underlying element is identical—it is an illegitimate, albeit
lawful, threat—and it is therefore rational today to treat them as examples of duress (albeit not economic
duress). …
91.
 
Furthermore, since the recognition of economic duress, there have been several cases in which lawful
act economic duress can be said to have been accepted as a ground for the avoidance of a contract or restitution
(whether made out on the facts or not) …
92.
 
For these three reasons, the better view is that, although controversial, lawful act duress does, and
should, exist as a matter of English law.
At paragraphs [83] and [84] Lord Burrows refers to the writings of academics who have
been critical of the proposition that English law should recognise a doctrine of lawful act
duress. In essence their view is that the making of a lawful threat should not in principle
suffice to set aside a contract and that certainty and stability in the law would best be
provided by a firm rule that lawful act duress act does not exist. A clear rule to this effect
is believed by such writers to be preferable to a recognition of the possibility of an
exception which is of such narrow scope that it will never in practice be invoked but
which may result in expensive litigation as parties attempt, unsuccessfully, to rely on the
possibility of there being such an exception. Powerful though these arguments are, they
did not persuade the Supreme Court for the reasons given by Lord Burrows. It is a very
bold step to shut the door completely on the recognition of lawful act duress. It is for
this reason that many judges are very reluctant, or refuse, to say never to the existence
of a claim. Further, some of the commentators who appear to wish to shut the door
completely on a lawful act duress claim may in fact leave open another escape route for
the courts. Thus Professor Virgo, one of the authors cited by Lord Burrows, states that ‘a
lawful threat may still result in restitution, but only … if the more stringent test of
unconscionability is satisfied’. It is not obvious that this approach results in greater
certainty because it simply moves the problem elsewhere, namely to the doctrine of
unconscionability. It is also, as Lord Burrows observes, very difficult to shut the door
entirely on lawful act duress given the existence of the blackmail cases (unless one treats
these cases as cases in which the ground for intervention by the courts is not duress but
the commission of a criminal offence). Although the issue is a difficult one, the approach
adopted by Lord Burrows has the merit of recognizing openly that there may be
exceptional cases in which lawful act duress can, for the reasons which he gave, suffice
to set aside a contract. On this basis it is suggested that the Supreme Court was correct
to conclude that lawful duress does exist as a matter of English law.
18.4.3.2.2
 
Common Ground on the Scope of Lawful Act Duress
There were a number of issues in relation to the scope of lawful act duress on which the
Supreme Court was unanimous. The first is that there was agreement on the importance
of certainty and clarity in commercial contract law and that there is ‘a significant danger’
that the reputation of English law for certainty and clarity would be lost if the law on
lawful act economic duress were to be stated ‘too widely or with insufficient precision’
(see [93]). This being the case, lawful act duress should be kept within very narrow
confines.
Secondly, it was agreed that ‘because the threat is of a lawful act, the question of
whether it is illegitimate should focus on the nature of the demand rather than the
nature of the threat’ ([96]), a proposition which is classically reflected in the case of
blackmail where the blackmailer has to justify the demand for money, not the threat
which has been made, given that the ordinarily blackmailer often threatens to do what
he has a right to do.
Thirdly, it was agreed that, in the context of lawful act economic duress, ‘a demand
motivated by commercial self-interest is, in general, justified’ ([136](iv) and to similar
effect see [97]–[99]). Thus Lord Burrows stated (at [136](iv)) that ‘lawful act economic
duress is essentially concerned with identifying rare exceptional cases where a demand,
motivated by commercial self-interest, is nevertheless unjustified’.
Fourthly, there was agreement that it was not appropriate to develop the law by
adopting an approach based on a ‘range of factors’ according to which a court would
have regard to a number of factors when deciding whether lawful act duress should
entitle a party to set aside a contract. There was held to be no need to inject such a
degree of uncertainty into a developing area of the law. On the contrary, Lord Burrows
stated (at [94]) that the law 
relating to lawful act duress was ‘in its infancy and the best
approach is for the common law to be clarified or developed in a traditional incremental
way’.
The final issue on which there was unanimity was that this was not an appropriate case
in which to rely on a general principle of good faith dealing ([95]) and, in this context,
Lord Burrows stated ([95]) that ‘the better strategy, at this stage in the law’s
development, is to try to set out a limited but clear and workable boundary for the
concept of lawful act economic duress in the context of the facts with which this case is
concerned’.
18.4.3.2.3
 
Differences in Relation to the Scope of Lawful Act Duress
Although Lord Burrows stated that the ‘better strategy’ was to seek to establish a ‘limited
but clear and workable boundary for the concept of lawful act economic duress’ the
Supreme Court found it much more difficult to establish these boundaries and indeed
they disagreed as to the limits of lawful act duress. As has been noted, the division here
is between Lord Hodge (with whom the other Justices of the Supreme Court expressed
their agreement) and Lord Burrows. Given that his approach represents the majority
approach, we shall commence with the analysis of Lord Hodge. We shall then move on
to consider the criticisms made of this approach by Lord Burrows before examining the
approach preferred by Lord Burrows and the reasons given by Lord Hodge for rejecting
that approach.
The analysis of the majority in relation to the scope of lawful act duress was set out by
Lord Hodge in the following terms:
2. …the courts have developed the common law doctrine of duress to include lawful act economic duress by
drawing on the rules of equity in relation to undue influence and treating as ‘illegitimate’ conduct which, when
the law of duress was less developed, had been identified by equity as giving rise to an agreement which it was
unconscionable for the party who had conducted himself or herself in that way to seek to enforce. In other
words, morally reprehensible behaviour which in equity was judged to render the enforcement of a contract
unconscionable in the context of undue influence has been treated by English common law as illegitimate
pressure in the context of duress.
3.
 
The boundaries of the doctrine of lawful act duress are not fixed and the courts should approach any
extension with caution, particularly in the context of contractual negotiations between commercial entities. In
any development of the doctrine of lawful act duress it will also be important to bear in mind not only that
analogous remedies already exist in equity, such as the doctrines of undue influence and unconscionable
bargains, but also the absence in English law of any overriding doctrine of good faith in contracting or any
doctrine of imbalance of bargaining power. …
4.
 
If one focuses on the few cases in which a remedy has been provided for what would now be analysed as
lawful act duress, there are to date two circumstances in which the English courts have recognised and provided
a remedy for such duress. The first circumstance is where a defendant uses his knowledge of criminal activity by
the claimant or a member of the claimant’s close family to obtain a personal benefit from the claimant by the
express or implicit threat to report the crime or initiate a prosecution. The second circumstance is where the
defendant, having exposed himself to a civil claim by the claimant, for example, for damages for breach of
contract, deliberately manoeuvres the claimant into a position of vulnerability by means which the law regards
as illegitimate and thereby forces the claimant to waive his claim. In both categories of case the defendant has
behaved in a highly reprehensible way which the courts have treated as amounting to illegitimate pressure.
A number of points should be noted here. The first is the willingness of Lord Hodge (at
[2]) to draw on the rules of equity in relation to undue influence (on which see 
Chapter
19
) when considering how the law of duress should develop. The second is the need for
caution in the development of the law, particularly where the contract is one entered
into between commercial parties (see [3]). But the most important point relates to the
identification by Lord Hodge (at [4]) of the ‘two circumstances in which the English
courts have recognised and provided a remedy for’ lawful act duress.
Lord Hodge expanded on these two circumstances in paragraphs [5]–[16] of his
judgment. Of the two circumstances, the first is the more straightforward. It consists of
cases in which a defendant exploits knowledge of criminal activity for his own benefit.
Lord Hodge cited three cases that fall within this category, namely 
Williams
 
v. 
Bayley
(1866) LR 1 HL 200 (on which see 
19.1
), 
Kaufman
 
v. 
Gerson
 
[1904] 1 KB 591, and
Mutual Finance Ltd
 
v. 
John Wetton & Sons Ltd
 
[1937] 2 KB 389 (all of which are cited
by Lord Burrows in his judgment at [89] above).
The more difficult exception is the second case, where the defendant uses illegitimate
means to manouevre the claimant into a position of weakness in order to force him to
waive his claim. There would appear to be a number of components to this exception.
First, the claimant must be in a position of vulnerability. Secondly, the defendant must
have deliberately manouevred the claimant into that position of vulnerability. Thirdly,
the means used by the defendant to achieve this must have been ‘illegitimate’ or ‘highly
reprehensible’ or ‘unconscionable’ (all terms used by Lord Hodge). Lord Hodge cited
two examples in this category, namely 
Borrelli
 
v. 
Ting
 
[2010] UKPC 21 and 
Progress
Bulk Carriers Ltd
 
v. 
Tube City IMS LLC (The Cenk Kaptaboglu)
 
[2012] EWHC 273
(Comm), [2012] 2 All ER (Comm) 855 (the latter case is also referred to in the
judgments as 
The Cenk K
).
In 
Progress Bulk Carriers
 
the claimants agreed to charter a vessel to the defendants. In
repudiatory breach of contract the claimants then allocated the vessel to the
performance of another contract and sought to allocate a new vessel to the charter with
the defendants. The claimants initially assured the defendants that they would
compensate the defendants for any loss suffered as a result of their failure to provide the
contracted vessel. The defendants were initially willing to accept the substitution of the
vessel on the basis that they reserved their right to seek damages from the defendants in
respect of any liability which they incurred towards their contracting party as a result of
the loss of the contracted-for vessel. However, the claimants subsequently stipulated
that they would only provide the substitute vessel if the defendants agreed to waive their
right to recover damages in respect of the claimants’ original breach of contract. Given
the late stage at which the claimants introduced this stipulation, the defendants agreed
to it under protest in order to avoid incurring liability to their own customers. It was
held that the agreement under which the defendants agreed to waive their claim against
the claimants was voidable for economic duress.
According to the analysis of Lord Hodge (at [17]), the basis for the decision in 
Progress
Bulk Carriers
 
was (i) the existence of a legal claim by the defendants against the
claimants and (ii) the manoeuvring by the claimants of the defendants by reprehensible
means (namely their prior breach of contract and their subsequent ‘misleading activity’)
into a vulnerable position where the defendants had no alternative but to waive their
pre-existing rights amounted to illegitimate pressure.
One of the difficulties with Lord Hodge’s second category lies in explaining why the facts
of 
Times Travel
 
did not fall within this category. After all, this was a case in which Times
Travel had a claim against PIAC for unpaid commission which it waived after PIAC
withheld a very large amount of commission which it owed to Times Travel, and further
PIAC 
increased the vulnerability of Times Travel by cutting substantially its normal
ticket allocation. This point was picked up by Lord Burrows in the following terms:
132. …On the face of it, PIAC’s conduct seems to fall within Lord Hodge’s lawful act duress category comprising
‘using illegitimate means to manoeuvre the claimant into a position of weakness to force him to waive his claim’.
The fact that the claimant was already in a weak position (because of the monopoly) cannot make the claim for
lawful act economic duress less deserving than if the claimant had been in a stronger bargaining position. It
follows that, in my view, contrary, as I understand it, to that of Lord Hodge, it is the ‘bad faith demand’
requirement, as I have explained it, that is critical to the decision that there was no lawful act economic duress
in this case.
Lord Burrows then moved on to express further concerns in relation to the approach of
Lord Hodge:
133. With great respect, I am also very concerned that, without any focus on the ‘bad faith demand’
requirement, defined in the specific sense that I have set out, and with instead the essential guide being that the
defendant’s conduct must be ‘reprehensible’ or ‘unconscionable’ or using ‘illegitimate means’ (which is, by
definition, distinct from unlawful means), one will be permitting lawful act economic duress to create
considerable uncertainty in the realm of commercial contracts. While not supporting a ‘bad faith demand’
requirement, Lord Hodge also refers at some points to ‘bad faith’ as being relevant (see, for example, paras 56
and 59) but it is not clear to me what Lord Hodge means by that and how that approach is consistent with his
rejection of a ‘good faith dealing’ principle. I have tried to make clear (see para 95) that I am precisely not
advocating a general principle of good faith dealing; and the ‘bad faith demand’ requirement that I have been
relying on … is narrow and sharply defined.
Lord Burrows refers in this section of his judgment to his preferred approach which he
described as his ‘bad faith demand requirement.’ He explained the content of this
requirement with reference to the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
CTN Cash and
Carry Ltd
 
v. 
Gallaher Ltd
 
[1994] 4 All ER 714 (to which we will return at 
18.4.3.2.4
) in
the following section of his judgment.
102. …[
CTN Cash and Carry
] may … be said to establish what I shall refer to hereinafter as the ‘bad faith
demand’ requirement. This requirement can be expressed as follows. In the context we are focusing on—of a
demand for what is claimed to be owing, or analogously, as on the facts of this case, a demand for the waiver of
a claim—it is a necessary requirement for establishing lawful act economic duress that the demand is made in
bad faith in the particular sense that the threatening party does not genuinely believe that it is owed what it is
claiming to be owed or does not genuinely believe that it has a defence to the claim being waived by the
threatened party. This is on the assumption that, as a matter of law, what the threatening party claims to be
owing is not legally owing or there is no defence to the claim being waived by the threatened party. …
112.
 
Taken together, what 
Borrelli
 
v. 
Ting
 
and 
Progress Bulk Carriers
 
can be taken to have established is
that, in relation to a demand for a waiver by the threatened party of a claim against the threatening party, the
demand is unjustified, so that the lawful act economic threat is illegitimate where: first, the threatening party
has deliberately created, or increased, 
the threatened party’s vulnerability to the demand; and, secondly, the
‘bad faith demand’ requirement is satisfied (ie the threatening party does not genuinely believe that it has a
defence, and there is no defence, to the claim being waived). …
125.
 
…the ‘bad faith demand’ requirement is dependent on there being an existing legal right and duty
between the parties (whether contractual or otherwise) which provides a clear and certain standard against
which alleged bad faith of the threatening party can be assessed. Without that tie to an existing legal right and
duty, the ‘bad faith demand’ requirement loses its force as being underpinned by a workable standard of
dishonesty: the bad faith demand is concerned with either a dishonest assertion of an existing right or the
dishonest removal (by waiver) of an existing right. It also loses its force as providing a clear and certain means
of controlling the scope of lawful act economic duress and of distinguishing a demand that is unjustified from
one that is made in ordinary commercial bargaining.
Lord Hodge in turn ‘respectfully’ expressed his disagreement with Lord Burrows’ ‘bad
faith demand’ requirement and he rejected it for the following four reasons:
54. First, the demand for a waiver, to which A [the party making the demand] must know that it has no prior
entitlement, is in principle no different from the demand for a sum of money as a pre-condition for entering
into contractual relations in the context of a commercial negotiation … [where] Lord Burrows … accepts that
economic duress could not be made out in the latter circumstance. If the demand for money, which is supported
by the assertion of A’s bargaining power, does not give rise to a claim for duress, why should a demand for a
waiver of a valid claim which is backed up in the same way?
55.
 
Secondly, the absence of an identifiable principle to distinguish those two circumstances would increase
the undesirable uncertainty in commercial transactions. …
56.
 
Thirdly, and in any event, bad faith plays a wider role in lawful act duress than merely the absence of
belief in an entitlement to a pre-existing right or in the invalidity of a claim for which A seeks a waiver. In both
Borrelli
 
and 
The Cenk K
 
the conduct of A by which A applied pressure to B involved bad faith or behaviour
which was similarly reprehensible. … In both cases it was the combination of the probable or at least possible
validity of B’s claim against A combined with A’s behaviour of that nature which gave rise to the court’s
conclusion that the waiver had been obtained through the application of illegitimate pressure. In other words,
bad faith is potentially relevant both to the content of the demand and to the context in which A makes its
demand. To my mind, the two cases do not support Lord Burrows’ model.
57.
 
Fourthly, there is no support in either 
Borrelli
 
or 
The Cenk K
 
for the proposition that the mere assertion
of bargaining power, such as a lawful threat to terminate an existing contract or to reduce the supply of goods
under the contract in a way which the contract allowed, could without more amount to illegitimate pressure.
Lord Burrows considers that PIAC’s deliberate act of cutting its ticket allocation, thereby increasing Times
Travel’s vulnerability to its demand for a waiver of a claim that it was in breach of contract, was an act which
was beyond the mere exercise of monopoly power and would have amounted to illegitimate pressure if PIAC
had known that it had indeed broken its contract. I respectfully disagree and take a narrower view of the scope
of lawful act economic duress in this context. The reduction of the ticket allocation was a hard-nosed exercise of
monopoly power, which, in the absence of a doctrine of unequal bargaining power, could not by itself amount to
illegitimate pressure. Something more was needed, such as the reprehensible characteristics of the behaviour in
Borrelli
 
and 
The Cenk K
. 
…
 
As I have said … the scope for lawful act economic duress is extremely limited in the
sphere of commercial transactions.
Lord Burrows for his part responded to Lord Hodge’s criticism expressed at paragraph
[54] above in the following terms:
135. …Lord Hodge suggests, at para 54 of his judgment, that there is no principled difference between a demand
for payment, based on a bad faith demand, and a demand for payment as a pre-condition to entering into a
contract. With respect, the principled difference is that one involves bad faith, as I have defined it, but the other
does not. I have sought to make clear … that the ‘bad faith demand’ requirement is dependent on there being an
existing legal right and duty between the parties. To try to apply it outside that context would risk unduly
interfering with ordinary commercial bargaining; and it would deprive the requirement of its force as being
underpinned by a workable standard of dishonesty and as providing a clear and certain means of controlling the
scope of lawful act economic duress. It is also worth stressing that the root principle, to which one is seeking to
provide a clear guide, is that the demand is unjustified so that the lawful act economic threat is illegitimate. At
this stage in the law’s development, my strategy (see para 95 above) has been to set out a limited but clear and
workable boundary for what constitutes an unjustified demand—so that a lawful act economic threat is
illegitimate—in the context of the facts with which this case is concerned. Any incremental development of what
the common law treats as an unjustified demand in relation to lawful act economic duress can in the future
proceed cautiously, in the light of known facts, from that secure base.
18.4.3.2.4
 
Concluding Thoughts
This difference of view between Lord Hodge and Lord Burrows did not affect the
outcome of the appeal in 
Times Travel
. The Supreme Court was unanimous in its
conclusion that Times Travel had not made good its claim of economic duress. Lord
Hodge concluded (at [58]) that there were no findings that PIAC had used any
reprehensible means to manoeuvre Times Travel into a position of increased
vulnerability in order to exploit that vulnerability. While PIAC had used ‘hard-nosed
commercial negotiation that exploited PIAC’s position as a monopoly supplier’, it did
not, at least according to Lord Hodge, involve the use of ‘reprehensible means of
applying pressure’ which was evident in cases such as 
Borrelli
 
v. 
Ting
 
and 
Progress Bulk
Carrier
 
and there were also no findings that ‘PIAC acted in bad faith in making the
demands which it did’. For Lord Burrows, the claim of economic duress failed because
the threatened lawful act ‘was not coupled with a bad faith demand’ (see [138]) because
Times Travel had failed to establish bad faith by PIAC in that it had not established that
PIAC did not genuinely believe that it was entitled to withhold the unpaid commission.
But in other cases the difference of view may be critical. A case which illustrates this
potential difference is the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
CTN Cash and Carry Ltd
 
v.
Gallaher Ltd
 
[1994] 4 All ER 714. The plaintiffs agreed to buy a consignment of
cigarettes from the defendants. The defendants mistakenly delivered the cigarettes to
the plaintiffs’ Burnley warehouse instead of their Preston warehouse. When the mistake
was discovered, the defendants agreed to collect the cigarettes from Burnley and deliver
them to Preston. Before they could do so, the cigarettes were stolen from the Burnley
warehouse. The defendants insisted that the plaintiffs pay for the stolen cigarettes,
maintaining that the cigarettes were at the plaintiffs’ risk at the time they were stolen.
The trial judge found that the defendants believed in all good faith that the cigarettes
were at the plaintiffs’ risk, but that there was 
no legal basis for their belief. In
subsequent negotiations, the defendants made clear to the plaintiffs that, unless they
paid for the cigarettes, the defendants would withdraw the credit facilities which the
plaintiffs had hitherto enjoyed. The defendants were under no contractual obligation to
continue to provide the plaintiffs with credit. The plaintiffs paid the money and then
sought to recover the money on the ground that it had been paid under duress. The
plaintiffs’ claim failed.
The decision is clearly correct on its facts. But what would have been the position if the
facts had been the same except that the defendants made their demand in bad faith
because they did not genuinely believe that the plaintiffs owed the money which the
defendants claimed was due to them. Although it was not necessary to resolve this point
for the purposes of the appeal, Lord Burrows expressed the view that in such a case the
‘bad faith demand requirement’ would be met so that the demand would have been
unjustified thereby rendering the threat illegitimate (see [122]). Lord Hodge disagreed
(see [46]–[52]). Thus he concluded (at [59]) that if the defendants had not believed their
demand to be well founded, the Court of Appeal would not have been correct to reach
the conclusion that the payment had been made under duress
absent circumstances which involved the manoeuvring by Gallaher [the defendants] of CTN [the plaintiffs] into
a position of vulnerability by means which involved bad faith or were similarly reprehensible and went beyond
the use of its position as a monopoly supplier, or which brought the transaction within the ambit of the
equitable doctrine of unconscionable transactions.
The difficulty with the latter passage, however, is the one raised by Lord Burrows,
namely identifying precisely the scope of the principle laid down by Lord Hodge and the
fear that it will generate uncertainty. While the principle itself does lack precision, it
may be that it will not generate a great deal of uncertainty in practice because lower
courts will pick up on the emphasis placed by the Supreme Court on the exceptional
nature of a lawful act duress claim and resist the invitation to find that the case before
them falls within that exception. An indication that this might be the outcome can be
gleaned from the judgment of Mr Richard Salter QC in 
Heritage Travel and Tourism
Ltd
 
v. 
Windhorst
 
[2021] EWHC 2380 (Comm), [34.3.3] where he stated:
In the commercial context, it is only in extremely limited circumstances that the law will regard a threat to act
lawfully as illegitimate or unconscionable. It is not ordinarily duress to threaten to do that which one has a right
to do, for instance to refuse to enter into a contract or to terminate a contract lawfully. The pursuit of
commercial self-interest is justified in commercial bargaining. The pressure applied by a negotiating party
(unless it involves a threat to act unlawfully) will very rarely come up to the standard of illegitimate pressure or
unconscionable conduct. It will therefore be a rare circumstance in which a court will find lawful act duress in
the context of commercial negotiation.
Although the Supreme Court has not closed the door entirely on the doctrine of lawful
act duress, it would appear likely that the courts will be very slow to open the door, in
which case it may be some time before we see a successful claim of lawful act duress, at
least in a contract entered into between two commercial parties.

Undue Influence
Central Issues
Undue influence is a creature of equity and assumes many different
forms. The principal forms consist of actual undue influence and
presumed undue influence.
Actual undue influence has many similarities with common law
duress. It generally consists of the application of illegitimate pressure
but would appear to extend to other forms of wrongdoing, such as
‘overreaching’ and ‘cheating’.
Cases of presumed undue influence are more difficult to classify. The
essential idea is that one party has taken advantage of a relationship
of trust and confidence to the substantial detriment of the party who
has reposed the trust and confidence in him. The courts have
experienced considerable difficulty in identifying the circumstances
which have the effect of triggering the operation of the presumption.
There appear to be two principal elements: (i) there must be a
relationship of sufficient trust and confidence between the parties and
(ii) the transaction that has taken place between the parties must not
be explicable in terms of the ordinary motives on which ordinary
people act. The presumption is a rebuttable one. It can be rebutted by
showing that entry into the transaction was the result of the free
exercise of independent will by the party seeking to set aside the
transaction.
The courts have generally been reluctant to attempt a comprehensive
definition of undue influence. They tend to emphasize the facts and
circumstances of the individual case. Thus relationships are ‘infinitely
various’ and no description of the relevant factors is ‘perfect’ or ‘all
embracing’. The emphasis is not only on ‘influence’ but on the ‘abuse’
or the ‘misuse’ of that influence. In this sense undue influence has
been said to have a connotation of impropriety. But it may be
impropriety in an attenuated form, in that it may take the form of failing
to ensure that the claimant has access to independent advice.
19.1
 
Introduction
Cases of alleged undue influence have caused considerable difficulties for the courts in
recent years. The difficulties relate, not to the existence of the doctrine, but to its scope
and its relationship with other doctrines, particularly duress (on which see 
Chapter 18
)
and other cases in which courts have intervened to protect the vulnerable or those who
have been exploited (on which see 
Chapter 20
). The very words ‘undue influence’ give
rise to difficulty. What does ‘undue’ mean? Does it mean ‘too much’, ‘illegitimate’ (in the
sense in which that word is used in the context of duress), or ‘unconscionable’?
‘Influence’ is not much better. Does it mean ‘pressure’, ‘domination’, ‘exploitation’,
‘dependence’, or something else? The courts have, until recently, made considerable use
of a ‘presumption’ of undue influence. But what was it that was being presumed? Was it
illegitimate pressure, exploitation, or excessive dependence? One of the principal issues
of controversy has been whether the focus of undue influence is upon the conduct of the
defendant, the state of mind of the claimant, or upon both elements. This controversy
remains unresolved. In some cases (such as 
R
 
v. 
Attorney-General for England and
Wales
 
[2003] UKPC 22, 
19.4.1
, and 
National Commercial Bank (Jamaica) Ltd
 
v. 
Hew
[2003] UKPC 51, 
19.4.2
) strong emphasis has been placed on the need for some form of
wrongdoing on the part of the defendant, whereas in other cases (see, for example,
Pesticcio
 
v. 
Huet
 
[2004] EWCA Civ 372, [2004] All ER (D) 36 (Apr), 
19.4.3
) the courts
have stated that a finding of undue influence does not require any wrongdoing on the
part of the defendant.
The traditional approach to undue influence is to distinguish between actual and
presumed undue influence (although the distinction between the two categories would
seem to be less rigid than previously and it may be that they represent no more than the
two principal methods by which undue influence may be proved). An example of actual
undue influence is provided by the decision of the House of Lords in 
Williams
 
v. 
Bayley
(1866) LR 1 HL 200. The plaintiff’s son gave the defendant bankers promissory notes
upon which he had forged the plaintiff’s signature. When the defendants discovered
what had taken place they met with the plaintiff and during the course of the meeting
they informed him that they had it within their power to prosecute his son. A solicitor
was present with the plaintiff during the meeting but he left in protest when the plaintiff
was asked to meet his son’s debts. The plaintiff then agreed to enter into a mortgage to
pay off the debts of his son, which he later sought to set aside. The House of Lords held
that the plaintiff was entitled to set aside the mortgage in equity. Lord Chelmsford
stated (at p. 214) that the agreement had been ‘extorted from the father by undue
pressure’. In so far as actual undue influence is based on the application of ‘undue
pressure’ it would appear to be the equitable counterpart of common law duress (see, for
example, 
R
 
v. 
Attorney-General for England and Wales
 
[2003] UKPC 22, 
19.4.1
) and it
has been observed that today 
Williams
 
would be seen as an example of lawful act duress
(
Pakistan International Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK) Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40,
[2021] 3 WLR 727, [9] and [90]). But there is no formal necessity to plead the case as
one of duress; it could, as in 
Williams
 
itself, still be pleaded as a case of actual undue
influence (
Libyan Investment Authority
 
v. 
Goldman Sachs International
 
[2016] EWHC
2530 (Ch), [136]). It is also important to keep in mind that actual undue influence may
extend beyond the application of illegitimate pressure and encompass subtler forms of
impropriety than those that currently fall within the scope of common law duress. Given
the potentially broader reach of actual undue influence (see 
Royal Bank of Scotland plc
v. 
Etridge (No 2)
 
[2001] UKHL 44, [2002] 2 AC 773, [8], [93], and [103]), 
19.3
), it
would appear preferable to retain the existing category of actual undue influence than
seek to assimilate it entirely within common law duress.
Cases of presumed undue influence are even more difficult. There are generally three
elements to a case of presumed undue influence. First, there must have been a
relationship of trust and confidence between the parties. Prior to the decision of the
House of Lords in 
Royal Bank of Scotland plc
 
v. 
Etridge (No 2)
 
[2001] UKHL 44,
[2002] 2 AC 773 (
19.3
) it was customary to sub-divide the cases into two groups. The
first group consisted of a class of relationships in which the law presumed that one party
was in a position to exercise influence or dominion over the other. These relationships
included parent and child, guardian and ward, doctor and patient, solicitor and client,
trustee and beneficiary, and religious adviser and disciple. The second group consisted
of cases in which the claimant proved that, on the facts, a relationship of trust and
confidence existed between the parties. Cases in this second group were inevitably fact
specific because they depended upon a finding that, 
in the particular case
, a
relationship of trust and confidence existed between the parties. However the future of
this second category is, at best, doubtful after the decision of the House of Lords in
Etridge
 
(see 
19.3
).
The second element in a presumed undue influence case is that there must be something
about the transaction which ‘calls for an explanation’. This requirement has been
expressed in different ways. In 
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
 
(1887) 36 Ch D 145 (
19.3
) Lindley LJ
stated that the gift must have been ‘so large as not to be reasonably accounted for on the
ground of friendship, relationship, charity, or other ordinary motives on which ordinary
men act’. In 
National Westminster Bank plc
 
v. 
Morgan
 
[1985] AC 686 Lord Scarman
stated that the transaction must be ‘manifestly disadvantageous’ to the person seeking to
set it aside. As a result of the decision of the House of Lords in 
Etridge
 
(
19.3
) it would
appear that the former test is the one that is to be applied in future cases.
These two elements between them suffice to trigger the presumption of undue influence.
The court must then consider whether the presumption has been rebutted. This is the
third element in a presumed undue influence claim. The factors relevant to the rebuttal
of the presumption have been summarized (Treitel, 
The Law of Contract
 
(15th edn,
Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited by Edwin Peel), para 10–030) as follows:
The presumption of undue influence is rebutted if the party benefiting from the transaction (A) shows that it
was ‘the free exercise of independent will’. The most usual way of doing this is to show that the other party (B)
had independent advice before entering into the transaction. But the mere fact that independent advice was
given will not of itself save the transaction. The advice must be competent and based on knowledge of all the
relevant facts. It has been suggested that the independent adviser must also approve the transaction, and that
his advice must be followed. This may be necessary where the influence is particularly strong, or where a very
large gift is made; but it is not necessary in every case. There is indeed no invariable rule that independent
advice is necessary to save the transaction; but A would lack elementary prudence if he did not ensure that such
advice was given.
The presumption will not be rebutted by demonstrating that there was a reasonable
explanation for the transaction (
Smith
 
v. 
Cooper
 
[2010] EWCA Civ 722, [2010] 2 FCR
551). It is necessary to go further and prove that the transaction was a result of the
exercise by the claimant of ‘full, free and informed thought’ (
Hackett
 
v. 
Crown
Prosecution Service
 
[2011] EWHC 1170 (Admin), [2011] All ER (D) 112 (May)).
A case in which the presumption of undue influence was not rebutted is 
Hammond
 
v.
Osborn
 
[2002] EWCA Civ 885. A 74-year-old man, Mr Pritler, who was in poor health,
realized his investments and wrote out four cheques to a total value of £297,000 in
favour of the defendant, Mrs Osborn, who had assumed the principal role in caring for
him. This sum represented ‘nearly 91.6% of his liquid assets’. Further, the consequence
of the realization of his investments in this way was that ‘he became prospectively liable
for charges for capital gains tax and higher rate tax’ amounting to almost £50,000. On
the death of Mr Pritler his family sought to set aside the gifts to the defendant. The
defendant conceded that there was a relationship of trust and confidence between
herself and Mr Pritler and that the gift was so large as to trigger the operation of the
presumption. The trial judge held that the presumption had been rebutted because he
was satisfied that the donor made the gift ‘only after full, free and informed thought
about it’. The Court of Appeal disagreed and held that the presumption had not been
rebutted. Sir Martin Nourse stated:
28. Here Mr Pritler received no advice at all, whether independent or of any other kind. I am prepared to
assume that there could be a case, perhaps there has been a case, where the nature and effect of the gift was so
fully explained to the donor by the donee as to satisfy the test. But there was nothing of that sort here. Mrs
Osborn did not draw Mr Pritler’s attention to the size of the gift, nor to the proportion of his liquid assets that it
represented, nor to the relatively small amount that was left to him …
29.
 
Although Mr Pritler knew that he was making a gift to Mrs Osborn and must have known that it was a
substantial gift, he was never told its size, even in approximate terms. So he did not know the nature of the gift.
Even more important, he was not told of its effect. … It is true that he was left with some £27,000 in cash, his
house valued at about £130,000 and an annual income of about £14,000 net. But no consideration was given as
to whether those assets would be sufficient to satisfy his future needs. Nor was any consideration given to the
extremely serious fiscal consequences of the realisation of his investments. Had he lived, as he was expected to,
he would have become liable to the Inland Revenue for nearly £50,000, with not much more than half that
amount in cash to meet the liability. It was no answer for Mrs Osborn to say, as she consistently did, that she
treated the money as still belonging to Mr Pritler and would never have left him in need. It is impossible to say
that the gift was made by Mr Pritler only after full, free and informed thought about it.
30.
 
The principal argument of Mr McCue [counsel for the defendant] in this court was that the presumption
is rebutted if it is shown that the conduct of the donee has been unimpeachable, or at any rate that there has
been nothing sinister in it. Such, he argued, had been the conduct of Mrs Osborn in this case …
32.
 
Even if it is correct to say that Mrs Osborn’s conduct was unimpeachable and that there was nothing
sinister in it, that would be no answer to an application of the presumption. As Cotton LJ said in 
Allcard
 
v.
Skinner
 
[
19.3
], the court does not interfere on the ground that any wrongful act has in fact been committed by
the donee but on the ground of public policy, which requires it to be affirmatively established that the donor’s
trust and confidence in the donee has not been betrayed or abused. In any event, I am unable to subscribe to Mr
McCue’s suggested view of Mrs Osborn’s conduct. The judge’s finding that her silence and deliberate falsehoods
after Mr Pritler’s death were caused by Mr Osborn ordering her to keep her mouth shut and by her fear of him,
while it may to a large extent excuse her, does not make her conduct unimpeachable nor does it relieve it of its
sinister appearance. What it shows is that there was still an attempted cover up, but that Mr Osborn was
involved in it as well as Mrs Osborn.
33.
 
I cannot agree with the judge’s view of this question. The presumption has not been rebutted and the
gift must be set aside. I would therefore allow Mrs Hammond’s appeal.
19.2
 
Three-Party Cases
Recent judicial exposition of undue influence has tended to take place in the context of
three-party cases rather than two-party cases, that is to say cases in which a wrong has
been committed by a third party and not the defendant. The word ‘wrong’ has been used
deliberately because one of the leading cases, 
Barclays Bank plc
 
v. 
O’Brien
 
[1994] 1 AC
180, did not, in the event, involve undue influence at all: it was a misrepresentation case.
The facts of 
Barclays Bank plc
 
v. 
O’Brien
 
were as follows. Mr O’Brien negotiated an
overdraft with Barclays for a company in which he had an interest. It was agreed that Mr
O’Brien would guarantee the company’s indebtedness and that his liability would, in
turn, be secured by a second charge on the matrimonial home. The bank manager asked
the branch at which the security documents were to be signed to ensure that the
O’Briens were ‘fully aware of the nature of the documentation to be signed and advised
that if they are in any doubt they should contact their solicitor before signing’. These
instructions were not complied with and Mrs O’Brien was given no explanation of the
effect of the documents before she signed them, nor was she advised of the need to take
independent advice. When the company’s indebtedness rose to £154,000, the bank
demanded that Mr O’Brien honour the guarantee. When he failed to do so, the bank
sought to enforce the charge which Mrs O’Brien had signed and to obtain possession of
the house. Mrs O’Brien sought to defend the claim on the ground that she had been
induced to sign the charge by the undue influence of her husband and by his
misrepresentation that the charge was limited to £60,000 and that its duration was to
be confined to a short period of time. The claim based on undue influence was rejected
in the Court of Appeal and was not pursued in the House of Lords, where the claim to
set aside the transaction was based on the misrepresentation of Mr O’Brien, of which it
was argued, in the event successfully, that the bank had constructive notice so that it
could not enforce the charge against Mrs O’Brien.
There were three steps to the reasoning of the House of Lords in 
O’Brien
. First Mrs
O’Brien had to demonstrate that she was entitled to set aside ‘the transaction’ as against
her husband. It is here that undue influence enters the arena as one of the possible
grounds on which a wife may be entitled to set aside a transaction against her husband.
The other ground, and the ground that was actually in issue in 
O’Brien
, was
misrepresentation. Secondly, the bank must have been put on notice of the possibility of
wrongdoing on the part of the husband. Thirdly, once put on notice, the bank had to
take certain steps to ensure that the agreement of the wife to the charge was properly
obtained. It is not necessary to enter into the details of the second and third elements of
this analysis because they have largely been overtaken by the decision of the House of
Lords in 
Etridge
. It suffices for the present purpose to note that the basis on which the
claimant was held to be entitled to set aside the charge as against the defendant bank
was not that the bank had committed a wrong but simply that it had notice that
someone else had committed a wrong and had failed to take sufficient steps to ensure
that the claimant was given adequate advice before deciding whether or not to enter into
the transaction.
The leading case on undue influence is now the decision of the House of Lords in 
Royal
Bank of Scotland plc
 
v. 
Etridge (No 2)
 
[2001] UKHL 44, [2002] 2 AC 773 (
19.3
). It is a
three-party case and it re-examines 
Barclays Bank
 
v. 
O’Brien
. It is, however, important
to see the operation of undue influence at work in a standard two-party case. Thus we
shall commence our analysis with the case of 
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
 
(1887) 36 Ch D 145,
which, in the words of Lord Nicholls in 
Etridge
 
([8]
  
), is ‘a case well known to every law
student’. We shall then turn to 
Etridge
 
itself.
19.3
 
Two Leading Cases
ALLCARD V. SKINNER
(1887) 36 Ch D 145, Court of Appeal
In 1868, the plaintiff was introduced by her ‘spiritual director and confessor’, Rev D
Nihill, to the defendant, who was the lady superior of the sisterhood of St Mary at
the Cross. In July of the same year, the plaintiff became an associate of the
sisterhood, and at that time promised to devote her property to the service of the
poor. She subsequently became a postulant, and then a novice, before, in 1871,
she joined the sisterhood. On becoming a sister the plaintiff became subject to the
rules of the sisterhood. These rules demanded her implicit obedience to the lady
superior, whose voice was stated to be ‘the voice of God’, and they also stated that
she must not ‘seek advice of any entern without the Superior’s leave’. She also
took a vow of poverty, which required her to give away all her property. Although
there was no requirement that she give her property to the sisterhood, it was found
that there was an expectation to that effect. The plaintiff left the sisterhood in 1879
and revoked her will under which she had left her property to the sisterhood. In
1885 the plaintiff sought to recover certain items of property which she had
transferred to the sisterhood. Her claim was rejected by the Court of Appeal,
affirming the decision of Kekewich J. Although she was able to show that the
property had been transferred while she was under the undue influence of the
defendant, it was held, Cotton LJ dissenting on this point, that her claim was
barred by virtue of her delay after leaving the sisterhood in bringing proceedings
(and for this purpose the majority found it unnecessary to decide whether the
appropriate label for the defence was acquiescence, laches, or affirmation). The
extracts which follow are concerned solely with the ground on which the plaintiff
was entitled to bring her claim and not with the scope of the defences.
Cotton LJ
The question is—Does the case fall within the principles laid down by the decisions
of the Court of Chancery in setting aside voluntary gifts executed by parties who at
the time were under such influence as, in the opinion of the Court, enabled the
donor afterwards to set the gift aside? These decisions may be divided into two
classes—First, where the Court has been satisfied that the gift was the result of
influence expressly used by the donee for the purpose; second, where the
relations between the donor and donee have at or shortly before the execution of
the gift been such as to raise a presumption that the donee had influence over the
donor. In such a case the Court sets aside the voluntary gift, unless it is proved
that in fact the gift was the spontaneous act of the donor acting under
circumstances which enabled him to exercise an independent will and which
justifies the Court in holding that the gift was the result of a free exercise of the
donor’s will. The first class of cases may be considered as depending on the
principle that no one shall be allowed to retain any benefit arising from his own
fraud or wrongful act. In the second class of cases the Court interferes, not on the
ground that any wrongful act has in fact been committed by the donee, but on the
ground of public policy, and to prevent the relations which existed between the
parties and the influence arising therefrom being abused …
The question is whether the case comes within the principle of the second
class, and I am of opinion that it does. At the time of the gift the Plaintiff was a
professed sister, and, as 
such, bound to render absolute submission to the
Defendant as superior of the sisterhood. She had no power to obtain independent
advice, she was in such a position that she could not freely exercise her own will
as to the disposal of her property, and she must be considered as being … ‘not, in
the largest and amplest sense of the term—not, in mind as well as person—an
entirely free agent’. … In my opinion, even if there were evidence that she had,
before she joined the sisterhood, advice on the question of how she should deal
with her property, that would not be sufficient. The question is, I think, whether at
the time when she executed the transfer she was under such influences as to
prevent the gift being considered as that of one free to determine what should be
done with her property …
Lindley LJ
I have examined the evidence with care in order to see whether any pressure was
put upon the Plaintiff in order to induce her to give her property to the sisterhood,
or whether any deception was practised upon her, or whether any unfair advantage
was taken of her, or whether any of her money was applied otherwise than bona
fide for the objects of the sisterhood, or for any purpose which the Plaintiff could
disapprove. The result of the evidence convinces me that no pressure, except the
inevitable pressure of the vows and rules, was brought to bear on the Plaintiff; that
no deception was practised upon her; that no unfair advantage was taken of her;
that none of her money was obtained or applied for any purpose other than the
legitimate objects of the sisterhood. … The real truth is that the Plaintiff gave away
her property as a matter of course, and without seriously thinking of the
consequences to herself. She had devoted herself and her fortune to the
sisterhood, and it never occurred to her that she should ever wish to leave the
sisterhood or desire to have her money back. In giving away her property as she
did she was merely acting up to her promise and vow and the rule of the
sisterhood, and to the standard of duty which she had erected for herself under the
influences and circumstances already stated …
There is no authority whatever for saying that her gifts were invalid at law. It is
to the doctrines of equity, then, that recourse must be had to invalidate such gifts, if
they are to be invalidated. The doctrine relied upon by the Appellant is the doctrine
of undue influence expounded and enforced in 
Huguenin
 
v. 
Baseley
 
(1807) 14 Ves
273 and other cases of that class. These cases may be subdivided into two
groups, which, however, often overlap.
First, there are the cases in which there has been some unfair and improper
conduct, some coercion from outside, some overreaching, some form of cheating,
and generally, though not always, some personal advantage obtained by a donee
placed in some close and confidential relation to the donor. … The evidence does
not bring this case within this group.
The second group consists of cases in which the position of the donor to the
donee has been such that it has been the duty of the donee to advise the donor, or
even to manage his property for him. In such cases the Court throws upon the
donee the burden of proving that he has not abused his position, and of proving
that the gift made to him has not been brought about by any undue influence on
his part. In this class of cases it has been considered necessary to shew that the
donor had independent advice, and was removed from the influence of the donee
when the gift to him was made …
I have not been able to find any case in which a gift has been set aside on the
ground of undue influence which does not fall within one or other or both of the
groups above mentioned. Nor can I find any authority which actually covers the
present case. But it does not follow that it is not reached by the principle on which
the Court has proceeded in dealing with the cases which have already called for
decision. They illustrate but do not limit the principle applied to them.
The principle must be examined. What then is the principle? Is it that it is right
and expedient to save persons from the consequences of their own folly? or is it
that it is right and expedient to save them from being victimised by other people?
In my opinion the doctrine of undue influence is founded upon the second of these
two principles. Courts of Equity have never set aside gifts on the ground of the
folly, imprudence, or want of foresight on the part of donors. The Courts have
always repudiated any such jurisdiction. 
Huguenin
 
v. 
Baseley
 
(1807) 14 Ves 273 is
itself a clear authority to this effect. It would obviously be to encourage folly,
recklessness, extravagance and vice if persons could get back property which they
foolishly made away with, whether by giving it to charitable institutions or by
bestowing it on less worthy objects. On the other hand, to protect people from
being forced, tricked or misled in any way by others into parting with their property
is one of the most legitimate objects of all laws; and the equitable doctrine of
undue influence has grown out of and been developed by the necessity of
grappling with insidious forms of spiritual tyranny and with the infinite varieties of
fraud.
As no Court has ever attempted to define fraud so no Court has ever attempted
to define undue influence, which includes one of its many varieties. The undue
influence which Courts of Equity endeavour to defeat is the undue influence of one
person over another; not the influence of enthusiasm on the enthusiast who is
carried away by it, unless indeed such enthusiasm is itself the result of external
undue influence. But the influence of one mind over another is very subtle, and of
all influences religious influence is the most dangerous and the most powerful, and
to counteract it Courts of Equity have gone very far … In this particular case I
cannot find any proof that any gift made by the Plaintiff was the result of any actual
exercise of power or influence on the part of the lady superior or of Mr Nihill, apart
from the influence necessarily incidental to their position in the sisterhood.
Everything that the Plaintiff did is in my opinion referable to her own willing
submission to the vows she took and to the rules which she approved, and to her
own enthusiastic devotion to the life and work of the sisterhood. …
Nevertheless, consider the position in which the Plaintiff had placed herself.
She had vowed poverty and obedience, and she was not at liberty to consult
externs without the leave of her superior. She was not a person who treated her
vows lightly; she was deeply religious and felt bound by her promise, by her vows,
and by the rules of the sisterhood. She was absolutely in the power of the lady
superior and Mr Nihill. A gift made by her under these circumstances to the lady
superior cannot in my opinion be retained by the donee. The equitable title of the
donee is imperfect by reason of the influence inevitably resulting from her position,
and which influence experience has taught the Courts to regard as undue.
Whatever doubt I might have had on this point if there had been no rule against
consulting externs, that rule in my judgment turns the scale against the Defendant.
In the face of that rule the gifts made to the sisterhood cannot be supported in the
absence of proof that the Plaintiff could have obtained independent advice if she
wished for it, and that she knew that she would have been allowed to obtain such
advice if she had desired to do so. I doubt whether the gifts could have been
supported if such proof had been given, unless there was also proof that she was
free to act on the advice which might be given to her. But the rule itself is so
oppressive and so easily abused that any person subject to it is in my opinion
brought within the class of those whom it is the duty of the Court to protect from
possible imposition. The gifts cannot be supported without proof of more freedom
in fact than the Plaintiff can be supposed to have actually enjoyed.
Where a gift is made to a person standing in a confidential relation to the donor,
the Court will not set aside the gift if of a small amount simply on the ground that
the donor had no 
independent advice. In such a case, some proof of the exercise
of the influence of the donee must be given. The mere existence of such influence
is not enough in such a case; … But if the gift is so large as not to be reasonably
accounted for on the ground of friendship, relationship, charity, or other ordinary
motives on which ordinary men act, the burden is upon the donee to support the
gift … in this case there was in fact no unfair or undue influence brought to bear
upon the Plaintiff other than such as inevitably resulted from the training she had
received, the promise she had made, the vows she had taken, and the rules to
which she had submitted herself. But her gifts were in fact made under a pressure
which, whilst it lasted, the Plaintiff could not resist, and were not, in my opinion,
past recall when that pressure was removed. When the Plaintiff emancipated
herself from the spell by which she was bound, she was entitled to invoke the aid
of the Court in order to obtain the restitution from the Defendant of so much of the
Plaintiff’s property as had not been spent in accordance with the wishes of the
Plaintiff, but remained in the hands of the Defendant.
Bowen LJ
… it is of essential importance to keep quite distinct two things which in their
nature seem to me to be different—the rights of the donor, and the duties of the
donee. … As to the rights of the donor in a case like the present I entertain no
doubt. … In the present instance there was no duress, no incompetency, no want
of mental power on the part of the donor. It seems to me that, so far as regards her
rights, she had the absolute right to deal with her property as she chose. Passing
next to the duties of the donee, … it is plain that equity will not allow a person who
exercises or enjoys a dominant religious influence over another to benefit directly
or indirectly by the gifts which the donor makes under or in consequence of such
influence, unless it is shewn that the donor, at the time of making the gift, was
allowed full and free opportunity for counsel and advice outside—the means of
considering his or her worldly position and exercising an independent will about it.
This is not a limitation placed on the action of the donor; it is a fetter placed upon
the conscience of the recipient of the gift, and one which arises out of public policy
and fair play … [The] Plaintiff … had vowed in the most sacred and solemn way
absolute and implicit obedience to the will of the Defendant, her superior, and she
was bound altogether to neglect the advice of externs—not to consult those
outside the convent … the Plaintiff, so long as she was fettered by this vow—so
long as she was under the dominant influence of this religious feeling—was a
person entitled to the protection of the rule. Now, was the Defendant bound by this
rule? I acquit her most entirely of all selfish feeling in the matter. I can see no sort
of wrongful desire to appropriate to herself any worldly benefit from the gift; but,
nevertheless, she was a person who benefited by it so far as the disposition of the
property was concerned, although, no doubt, she meant to use it in conformity with
the rules of the institution, and did so use it.
Commentary
Allcard
 
is an interesting case for a number of reasons. First, the judges distinguish
between actual and presumed undue influence. 
Allcard
 
itself is a case of presumed
undue influence. Nevertheless, the judges did give brief consideration to the scope of
actual undue influence. Thus Lindley LJ stated that actual undue influence extends to
cases of ‘overreaching’ and ‘cheating’. Secondly, it is not easy to identify the basis upon
which the Court of Appeal concluded that this was a case of presumed undue influence.
There are passages from the 
judgment of Lindley LJ which suggest that ‘victimization’ is
the basis of a finding of undue influence. This suggests that the search is for some
wrongdoing on the part of the defendant. But this rationalization is difficult to reconcile
with his conclusion that there was nothing to suggest that any gift made by the plaintiff
was the result of the actual exercise of power or influence by the Mother Superior. This
tends to suggest that the basis for the finding that this was a case of presumed undue
influence had more to do with the position of the plaintiff than the behaviour of the
defendant (see further 
19.4.2
). Thus Professors Birks and Chin (‘On the Nature of Undue
Influence’ in J Beatson and D Friedmann (eds), 
Good Faith and Fault in Contract Law
(Oxford University Press, 1995), at p. 68) suggest that:
in presuming the undue influence the Court of Appeal was not presuming recourse to threats, express or
implied, either by the Mother Superior or by the clergyman who had been the co-founder of the convent. The
plaintiff had been under a spell compounded of her enthusiasm for the sisterhood and devotion to its rules,
which included an obligation to seek advice only within the order. Her weakness consisted in her impaired
capacity 
vis-à-vis
 
the head of the order to judge her own best interests. She was excessively dependent or, if
‘dependent’ is a shade wrong, she was excessively spell-bound. Either way, her autonomy was impaired to an
exceptional degree.
But a plaintiff- or claimant-sided version of 
Allcard
 
is not without its own difficulties. As
Professor Chen-Wishart has observed ([2006] 
Current Legal Problems
 
231, 238),
Allcard
 
cannot ‘realistically support a claimant-sided story’ given that there was ‘ample
finding that the nun knew what was expected of her before she joined the sisterhood’
and that ‘everything she did was referable to her own willing submission and
enthusiastic devotion to the life and work of the sisterhood’. We may view the plaintiff as
being misguided in her devotion to the sisterhood but should the law characterize her as
someone who was unable to manage her own affairs (given that any inability appeared
to relate only to her dealings with the sisterhood) or patronisingly take away her
freedom to dispose of her property as she sees fit?
Thirdly, it would appear that the critical factor was that the plaintiff did not have access
to external, independent advice. In the absence of such independent advice there was
nothing to free the plaintiff from her overwhelming sense that she was bound to give
away all her property. Had she had independent advice, been free to act on it, and had
nevertheless decided to give away her property, it is unlikely that the Court of Appeal
would have held that the transaction could be set aside. The key element here may not
be the giving of independent advice (since the plaintiff would in all probability not have
accepted the advice in the light of her devotion to the sisterhood) but of proof that she
was free to act on that advice. But here we encounter the problem of how to demonstrate
that she was free to act on any independent advice that she was given.
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND PLC V. ETRIDGE (NO 2)
[2001] UKHL 44, [2002] 2 AC 773, House of Lords
The House of Lords heard eight appeals. Each case arose out of a transaction in
which a wife charged her interest in her home in favour of a bank as security for
her husband’s indebtedness or the indebtedness of a company through which he
carried on business. In seven of the appeals the bank sought to enforce the charge
signed by the wife. The wife raised a 
defence that the bank was on notice that her
concurrence in the transaction had been procured by her husband’s undue
influence. In the eighth appeal the wife claimed damages from a solicitor who
advised her before she entered into a guarantee obligation under the undue
influence of her husband. Given the range of cases before the House of Lords it is
not possible to include within the extracts the application of the legal principles to
the facts of the cases. In the extracts that follow, the excerpts are confined to the
analysis employed by their Lordships of undue influence itself. Their analysis of the
other issues is noted in the commentary, and further extracts from the speech of
Lord Nicholls are to be found in the 
online resources
 
which support this book.
Lord Bingham of Cornhill
3. … While the opinions of Lord Nicholls and Lord Scott show some difference of
expression and approach, I do not myself discern any significant difference of legal
principle applicable to these cases, and I agree with both opinions. But if I am
wrong and such differences exist, it is plain that the opinion of Lord Nicholls
commands the unqualified support of all members of the House.
Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead
Undue influence
6. The issues raised by these appeals make it necessary to go back to first
principles. Undue influence is one of the grounds of relief developed by the courts
of equity as a court of conscience. The objective is to ensure that the influence of
one person over another is not abused. In everyday life people constantly seek to
influence the decisions of others. They seek to persuade those with whom they are
dealing to enter into transactions, whether great or small. The law has set limits to
the means properly employable for this purpose. To this end the common law
developed a principle of duress. Originally this was narrow in its scope, restricted
to the more blatant forms of physical coercion, such as personal violence.
7.
 
Here, as elsewhere in the law, equity supplemented the common law. Equity
extended the reach of the law to other unacceptable forms of persuasion. The law
will investigate the manner in which the intention to enter into the transaction was
secured: ‘how the intention was produced’, in the oft repeated words of Lord Eldon
LC, from as long ago as 1807 (
Huguenin
 
v. 
Baseley
 
14 Ves 273, 300). If the
intention was produced by an unacceptable means, the law will not permit the
transaction to stand. The means used is regarded as an exercise of improper or
‘undue’ influence, and hence unacceptable, whenever the consent thus procured
ought not fairly to be treated as the expression of a person’s free will. It is
impossible to be more precise or definitive. The circumstances in which one
person acquires influence over another, and the manner in which influence may be
exercised, vary too widely to permit of any more specific criterion.
8.
 
Equity identified broadly two forms of unacceptable conduct. The first
comprises overt acts of improper pressure or coercion such as unlawful threats.
Today there is much overlap with the principle of duress as this principle has
subsequently developed. The second form arises out of a relationship between two
persons where one has acquired over another a measure of influence, or
ascendancy, of which the ascendant person then takes unfair advantage …
9.
 
In cases of this latter nature the influence one person has over another
provides scope for misuse without any specific overt acts of persuasion. The
relationship between two 
individuals may be such that, without more, one of them
is disposed to agree a course of action proposed by the other. Typically this occurs
when one person places trust in another to look after his affairs and interests, and
the latter betrays this trust by preferring his own interests. He abuses the influence
he has acquired. In 
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
 
(1887) 36 Ch D 145, a case well known to
every law student, Lindley LJ, at p. 181, described this class of cases as those in
which it was the duty of one party to advise the other or to manage his property for
him …
10.
 
The law has long recognised the need to prevent abuse of influence in
these ‘relationship’ cases despite the absence of evidence of overt acts of
persuasive conduct. The types of relationship, such as parent and child, in which
this principle falls to be applied cannot be listed exhaustively. Relationships are
infinitely various. Sir Guenter Treitel QC has rightly noted that the question is
whether one party has reposed sufficient trust and confidence in the other, rather
than whether the relationship between the parties belongs to a particular type: see
Treitel, 
The Law of Contract
, 10th edn (1999), pp. 380–381. For example, the
relation of banker and customer will not normally meet this criterion, but
exceptionally it may: see 
National Westminster Bank plc
 
v. 
Morgan
 
[1985] AC 686,
707–709.
11.
 
Even this test is not comprehensive. The principle is not confined to cases
of abuse of trust and confidence. It also includes, for instance, cases where a
vulnerable person has been exploited. Indeed, there is no single touchstone for
determining whether the principle is applicable. Several expressions have been
used in an endeavour to encapsulate the essence: trust and confidence, reliance,
dependence or vulnerability on the one hand and ascendancy, domination or
control on the other. None of these descriptions is perfect. None is all embracing.
Each has its proper place.
12.
 
In 
CIBC Mortgages plc
 
v. 
Pitt
 
[1994] 1 AC 200 your Lordships’ House
decided that in cases of undue influence disadvantage is not a necessary
ingredient of the cause of action. It is not essential that the transaction should be
disadvantageous to the pressurised or influenced person, either in financial terms
or in any other way. However, in the nature of things, questions of undue influence
will not usually arise, and the exercise of undue influence is unlikely to occur,
where the transaction is innocuous. The issue is likely to arise only when, in some
respect, the transaction was disadvantageous either from the outset or as matters
turned out.
Burden of proof and presumptions
13. Whether a transaction was brought about by the exercise of undue influence is
a question of fact. Here, as elsewhere, the general principle is that he who asserts
a wrong has been committed must prove it. The burden of proving an allegation of
undue influence rests upon the person who claims to have been wronged. This is
the general rule. The evidence required to discharge the burden of proof depends
on the nature of the alleged undue influence, the personality of the parties, their
relationship, the extent to which the transaction cannot readily be accounted for by
the ordinary motives of ordinary persons in that relationship, and all the
circumstances of the case.
14.
 
Proof that the complainant placed trust and confidence in the other party in
relation to the management of the complainant’s financial affairs, coupled with a
transaction which calls for explanation, will normally be sufficient, failing
satisfactory evidence to the contrary, to discharge the burden of proof. On proof of
these two matters the stage is set for the court to infer that, in the absence of a
satisfactory explanation, the transaction can only have been procured by undue
influence. In other words, proof of these two facts is prima facie evidence that the
defendant abused the influence he acquired in the parties’ relationship. He
preferred 
his own interests. He did not behave fairly to the other. So the evidential
burden then shifts to him. It is for him to produce evidence to counter the inference
which otherwise should be drawn …
16.
 
Generations of equity lawyers have conventionally described this situation
as one in which a presumption of undue influence arises. This use of the term
‘presumption’ is descriptive of a shift in the evidential onus on a question of fact.
When a plaintiff succeeds by this route he does so because he has succeeded in
establishing a case of undue influence. The court has drawn appropriate
inferences of fact upon a balanced consideration of the whole of the evidence at
the end of a trial in which the burden of proof rested upon the plaintiff. The use, in
the course of the trial, of the forensic tool of a shift in the evidential burden of proof
should not be permitted to obscure the overall position. These cases are the
equitable counterpart of common law cases where the principle of res ipsa loquitur
is invoked. There is a rebuttable evidential presumption of undue influence.
17.
 
The availability of this forensic tool in cases founded on abuse of influence
arising from the parties’ relationship has led to this type of case sometimes being
labelled ‘presumed undue influence’. This is by way of contrast with cases
involving actual pressure or the like, which are labelled ‘actual undue influence’. …
This usage can be a little confusing. In many cases where a plaintiff has claimed
that the defendant abused the influence he acquired in a relationship of trust and
confidence the plaintiff has succeeded by recourse to the rebuttable evidential
presumption. But this need not be so. Such a plaintiff may succeed even where
this presumption is not available to him; for instance, where the impugned
transaction was not one which called for an explanation.
18.
 
The evidential presumption discussed above is to be distinguished sharply
from a different form of presumption which arises in some cases. The law has
adopted a sternly protective attitude towards certain types of relationship in which
one party acquires influence over another who is vulnerable and dependent and
where, moreover, substantial gifts by the influenced or vulnerable person are not
normally to be expected. Examples of relationships within this special class are
parent and child, guardian and ward, trustee and beneficiary, solicitor and client,
and medical adviser and patient. In these cases the law presumes, irrebuttably,
that one party had influence over the other. The complainant need not prove he
actually reposed trust and confidence in the other party. It is sufficient for him to
prove the existence of the type of relationship.
19.
 
It is now well established that husband and wife is not one of the
relationships to which this latter principle applies … there is nothing unusual or
strange in a wife, from motives of affection or for other reasons, conferring
substantial financial benefits on her husband. Although there is no presumption,
the court will nevertheless note, as a matter of fact, the opportunities for abuse
which flow from a wife’s confidence in her husband. The court will take this into
account with all the other evidence in the case. Where there is evidence that a
husband has taken unfair advantage of his influence over his wife, or her
confidence in him, ‘it is not difficult for the wife to establish her title to relief’ …
Independent advice
20. Proof that the complainant received advice from a third party before entering
into the impugned transaction is one of the matters a court takes into account
when weighing all the evidence. The weight, or importance, to be attached to such
advice depends on all the circumstances. In the normal course, advice from a
solicitor or other outside adviser can be expected to bring home to a complainant a
proper understanding of what he or she is about to do. But a person may
understand fully the implications of a proposed transaction, for 
instance, a
substantial gift, and yet still be acting under the undue influence of another. Proof
of outside advice does not, of itself, necessarily show that the subsequent
completion of the transaction was free from the exercise of undue influence.
Whether it will be proper to infer that outside advice had an emancipating effect, so
that the transaction was not brought about by the exercise of undue influence, is a
question of fact to be decided having regard to all the evidence in the case.
Manifest disadvantage
21. As already noted, there are two prerequisites to the evidential shift in the
burden of proof from the complainant to the other party. First, that the complainant
reposed trust and confidence in the other party, or the other party acquired
ascendancy over the complainant. Second, that the transaction is not readily
explicable by the relationship of the parties.
22.
 
Lindley LJ summarised this second prerequisite in the leading authority of
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
, 36 Ch D 145, where the donor parted with almost all her
property. Lindley LJ pointed out that where a gift of a small amount is made to a
person standing in a confidential relationship to the donor, some proof of the
exercise of the influence of the donee must be given. The mere existence of the
influence is not enough. He continued, at p. 185: ‘But if the gift is so large as not to
be reasonably accounted for on the ground of friendship, relationship, charity, or
other ordinary motives on which ordinary men act, the burden is upon the donee to
support the gift’ …
24. …
 
The second prerequisite, as expressed by Lindley LJ, is good sense. It
is a necessary limitation upon the width of the first prerequisite. It would be absurd
for the law to presume that every gift by a child to a parent, or every transaction
between a client and his solicitor or between a patient and his doctor, was brought
about by undue influence unless the contrary is affirmatively proved. Such a
presumption would be too far-reaching. The law would be out of touch with
everyday life if the presumption were to apply to every Christmas or birthday gift by
a child to a parent, or to an agreement whereby a client or patient agrees to be
responsible for the reasonable fees of his legal or medical adviser. The law would
be rightly open to ridicule, for transactions such as these are unexceptionable.
They do not suggest that something may be amiss. So something more is needed
before the law reverses the burden of proof, something which calls for an
explanation. When that something more is present, the greater the disadvantage to
the vulnerable person, the more cogent must be the explanation before the
presumption will be regarded as rebutted.
25.
 
This was the approach adopted by Lord Scarman in 
National Westminster
Bank plc
 
v. 
Morgan
 
[1985] AC 686, 703–707. He cited Lindley LJ’s observations in
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
 
36 Ch D 145, 185, which I have set out above. He noted that
whatever the legal character of the transaction, it must constitute a disadvantage
sufficiently serious to require evidence to rebut the presumption that in the
circumstances of the parties’ relationship, it was procured by the exercise of undue
influence …
26.
 
Lord Scarman attached the label ‘manifest disadvantage’ to this second
ingredient necessary to raise the presumption. This label has been causing
difficulty. It may be apt enough when applied to straightforward transactions such
as a substantial gift or a sale at an undervalue. But experience has now shown
that this expression can give rise to misunderstanding. The label is being
understood and applied in a way which does not accord with the meaning intended
by Lord Scarman, its originator.
27.
 
The problem has arisen in the context of wives guaranteeing payment of
their husband’s business debts. In recent years judge after judge has grappled with
the baffling question 
whether a wife’s guarantee of her husband’s bank overdraft,
together with a charge on her share of the matrimonial home, was a transaction
manifestly to her disadvantage.
28.
 
In a narrow sense, such a transaction plainly (‘manifestly’) is
disadvantageous to the wife. She undertakes a serious financial obligation, and in
return she personally receives nothing. But that would be to take an unrealistically
blinkered view of such a transaction. Unlike the relationship of solicitor and client
or medical adviser and patient, in the case of husband and wife there are inherent
reasons why such a transaction may well be for her benefit. Ordinarily, the fortunes
of husband and wife are bound up together. If the husband’s business is the
source of the family income, the wife has a lively interest in doing what she can to
support the business. A wife’s affection and self-interest run hand-in-hand in
inclining her to join with her husband in charging the matrimonial home, usually a
jointly-owned asset, to obtain the financial facilities needed by the business. The
finance may be needed to start a new business, or expand a promising business,
or rescue an ailing business.
29.
 
Which, then, is the correct approach to adopt in deciding whether a
transaction is disadvantageous to the wife: the narrow approach, or the wider
approach? The answer is neither. The answer lies in discarding a label which gives
rise to this sort of ambiguity. The better approach is to adhere more directly to the
test outlined by Lindley LJ in 
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
 
36 Ch D 145, and adopted by Lord
Scarman in 
National Westminster Bank plc
 
v. 
Morgan
 
[1985] AC 686, in the
passages I have cited.
30.
 
I return to husband and wife cases. I do not think that, in the ordinary
course, a guarantee of the character I have mentioned is to be regarded as a
transaction which, failing proof to the contrary, is explicable only on the basis that it
has been procured by the exercise of undue influence by the husband. Wives
frequently enter into such transactions. There are good and sufficient reasons why
they are willing to do so, despite the risks involved for them and their families. They
may be enthusiastic. They may not. They may be less optimistic than their
husbands about the prospects of the husbands’ businesses. They may be anxious,
perhaps exceedingly so. But this is a far cry from saying that such transactions as
a class are to be regarded as prima facie evidence of the exercise of undue
influence by husbands.
31.
 
I have emphasised the phrase ‘in the ordinary course’. There will be cases
where a wife’s signature of a guarantee or a charge of her share in the matrimonial
home does call for explanation. Nothing I have said above is directed at such a
case.
A cautionary note
32. I add a cautionary note. … It concerns the general approach to be adopted by
a court when considering whether a wife’s guarantee of her husband’s bank
overdraft was procured by her husband’s undue influence. Undue influence has a
connotation of impropriety. In the eye of the law, undue influence means that
influence has been misused. Statements or conduct by a husband which do not
pass beyond the bounds of what may be expected of a reasonable husband in the
circumstances should not, without more, be castigated as undue influence.
Similarly, when a husband is forecasting the future of his business, and expressing
his hopes or fears, a degree of hyperbole may be only natural. Courts should not
too readily treat such exaggerations as misstatements.
33.
 
Inaccurate explanations of a proposed transaction are a different matter.
So are cases where a husband, in whom a wife has reposed trust and confidence
for the management of their financial affairs, prefers his interests to hers and
makes a choice for both of them on that footing. Such a husband abuses the
influence he has. He fails to discharge the obligation of candour and fairness he
owes a wife who is looking to him to make the major financial decisions.
Lord Clyde
92. I question the wisdom of the practice which has grown up, … of attempting to
make classifications of cases of undue influence. That concept is in any event not
easy to define. … It is something which can be more easily recognised when found
than exhaustively analysed in the abstract. Correspondingly the attempt to build up
classes or categories may lead to confusion. The confusion is aggravated if the
names used to identify the classes do not bear their actual meaning. Thus on the
face of it a division into cases of ‘actual’ and ‘presumed’ undue influence appears
illogical. It appears to confuse definition and proof. There is also room for
uncertainty whether the presumption is of the existence of an influence or of its
quality as being undue. I would also dispute the utility of the further sophistication
of subdividing ‘presumed undue influence’ into further categories. All these
classifications to my mind add mystery rather than illumination.
93. There is a considerable variety in the particular methods by which undue
influence may be brought to bear on the grantor of a deed. They include cases of
coercion, domination, victimisation and all the insidious techniques of persuasion.
Certainly it can be recognised that in the case of certain relationships it will be
relatively easier to establish that undue influence has been at work than in other
cases where that sinister conclusion is not necessarily to be drawn with such ease.
English law has identified certain relationships where the conclusion can prima
facie be drawn so easily as to establish a presumption of undue influence. But this
is simply a matter of evidence and proof. In other cases the grantor of the deed will
require to fortify the case by evidence, for example, of the pressure which was
unfairly applied by the stronger party to the relationship, or the abuse of a trusting
and confidential relationship resulting in for the one party a disadvantage and for
the other a collateral benefit beyond what might be expected from the relationship
of the parties. At the end of the day, after trial, there will either be proof of undue
influence or that proof will fail and it will be found that there was no undue
influence. In the former case, whatever the relationship of the parties and however
the influence was exerted, there will be found to have been an actual case of
undue influence. In the latter there will be none …
Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough
(1)
 
Presumed undue influence
103. The division between presumed and actual undue influence derives from the
judgments in 
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
. Actual undue influence presents no relevant
problem. It is an equitable wrong committed by the dominant party against the
other which makes it unconscionable for the dominant party to enforce his legal
rights against the other. It is typically some express conduct overbearing the other
party’s will. It is capable of including conduct which might give a defence at law, for
example, duress and misrepresentation. … Actual undue influence does not
depend upon some pre-existing relationship between the two parties though it is
most commonly associated with and derives from such a relationship. He who
alleges actual undue influence must prove it.
104.
 
Presumed undue influence is different in that it necessarily involves some
legally recognised relationship between the two parties. As a result of that
relationship one party is treated as owing a special duty to deal fairly with the
other. It is not necessary for present purposes to define the limits of the
relationships which give rise to this duty. Typically they are fiduciary or closely
analogous relationships … Such legal relationships can be described as
relationships where one party is legally presumed to repose trust and confidence in
the other—the other side of the coin to the duty not to abuse that confidence. But
there is no 
presumption properly so called that the confidence has been abused. It
is a matter of evidence. … Thus, at the trial the judge will decide on the evidence
whether he is in fact satisfied that there was no abuse of confidence. It will be
appreciated that the relevance of the concept of ‘manifest disadvantage’ is
evidential. It is relevant to the question whether there is any issue of abuse which
can properly be raised. It is relevant to the determination whether in fact abuse did
or did not occur. It is a fallacy to argue from the terminology normally used,
‘presumed undue influence’, to the position, not of presuming that one party
reposed trust and confidence in the other, but of presuming that an abuse of that
relationship has occurred; factual inference, yes, once the issue has been properly
raised, but not a presumption.
105.
 
The Court of Appeal in 
Aboody
 
[1990] 1 QB 923 and Lord Browne-
Wilkinson [in 
O’Brien
] classified cases where there was a legal relationship
between the parties which the law presumed to be one of trust and confidence as
‘presumed undue influence: class 2(A)’. They then made the logical extrapolation
that there should be a class 2(B) to cover those cases where it was proved by
evidence that one party had in fact reposed trust and confidence in the other. It
was then said that the same consequences flowed from this factual relationship as
from the legal class 2(A) relationship. …
107.
 
In agreement with what I understand to be the view of your Lordships, I
consider that the so-called class 2(B) presumption should not be adopted. It is not
a useful forensic tool. The wife or other person alleging that the relevant
agreement or charge is not enforceable must prove her case. She can do this by
proving that she was the victim of an equitable wrong. This wrong may be an overt
wrong, such as oppression; or it may be the failure to perform an equitable duty,
such as a failure by one in whom trust and confidence is reposed not to abuse that
trust by failing to deal fairly with her and have proper regard to her interests.
Although the general burden of proof is, and remains, upon her, she can discharge
that burden of proof by establishing a sufficient prima facie case to justify a
decision in her favour on the balance of probabilities, the court drawing appropriate
inferences from the primary facts proved. Evidentially, the opposite party will then
be faced with the necessity to adduce evidence sufficient to displace that
conclusion. Provided it is remembered that the burden is an evidential one, the
comparison with the operation of the doctrine res ipsa loquitur is useful.
Lord Scott of Foscote
Undue influence
151. Undue influence cases have, traditionally, been regarded as falling into two
classes, cases where undue influence must be affirmatively proved (Class 1) and
cases where undue influence will be presumed (Class 2). The nature of the two
classes was described by Slade LJ in 
Bank of Credit and Commerce International
SA
 
v. 
Aboody
 
[1990] 1 QB 923, 953:
‘Ever since the judgments of this court in 
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
 
… clear distinction has been drawn between
(1) those cases in which the court will uphold a plea of undue influence only if it is satisfied that such
influence has been affirmatively proved on the evidence (commonly referred to as cases of “actual
undue influence” … “Class 1” cases); (2) those cases (commonly referred to as cases of “presumed
undue influence” … “Class 2” cases) in which the relationship between the parties will lead the court to
presume that undue influence has been exerted unless evidence is adduced proving the contrary, eg by
showing that the complaining party has had independent advice.’
152. This passage provides, if I may respectfully say so, an accurate summary
description of the two classes. But, like most summaries, it requires some
qualification.
153.
 
First, the Class 2 presumption is an evidential rebuttable presumption. It
shifts the onus from the party who is alleging undue influence to the party who is
denying it. Second, the weight of the presumption will vary from case to case and
will depend both on the particular nature of the relationship and on the particular
nature of the impugned transaction. Third, the type and weight of evidence needed
to rebut the presumption will obviously depend upon the weight of the presumption
itself …
154.
 
The onus will, of course, lie on the person alleging the undue influence to
prove in the first instance sufficient facts to give rise to the presumption. The
relationship relied on in support of the presumption will have to be proved.
155.
 
In 
National Westminster Bank plc
 
v. 
Morgan
 
[1985] AC 686, 704 Lord
Scarman, referring to the character of the impugned transaction in a Class 2 case,
said: ‘it must constitute a disadvantage sufficiently serious to require evidence to
rebut the presumption that in the circumstances of the relationship between the
parties it was procured by the exercise of undue influence’. Lord Scarman went on:
‘In my judgment, therefore, the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the presumption of undue
influence can arise from the evidence of the relationship of the parties without also evidence that the
transaction itself was wrongful in that it constituted an advantage taken of the person subjected to the
influence which, failing proof to the contrary, was explicable only on the basis that undue influence had
been exercised to procure it.’
With respect to Lord Scarman, the reasoning seems to me to be circular. The
transaction will not be ‘wrongful’ unless it was procured by undue influence. Its
‘wrongful’ character is a conclusion, not a tool by which to detect the presence of
undue influence. On the other hand, the nature of the transaction, its inexplicability
by reference to the normal motives by which people act, may, and usually will,
constitute important evidential material.
156.
 
Lord Browne-Wilkinson in 
CIBC Mortgages plc
 
v. 
Pitt
 
[1994] 1 AC 200
pointed out, plainly correctly, that if undue influence is proved, the victim’s right to
have the transaction set aside will not depend upon the disadvantageous quality of
the transaction. Where, however a Class 2 presumption of undue influence is said
to arise, the nature of the impugned transaction will always be material, no matter
what the relationship between the parties. … It is, in my opinion, the combination
of relationship and the nature of the transaction that gives rise to the presumption
and, if the transaction is challenged, shifts the onus to the transferee …
161.
 
For my part, I doubt the utility of the Class 2B classification. Class 2A is
useful in identifying particular relationships where the presumption arises. The
presumption in Class 2B cases, however, is doing no more than recognising that
evidence of the relationship between the dominant and subservient parties,
coupled with whatever other evidence is for the time being available, may be
sufficient to justify a finding of undue influence on the balance of probabilities. The
onus shifts to the defendant. Unless the defendant introduces evidence to
counteract the inference of undue influence that the complainant’s evidence
justifies, the complainant will succeed. In my opinion, the presumption of undue
influence in Class 2B cases has the same function in undue influence cases as res
ipsa loquitur has in negligence cases. It recognises an evidential state of affairs in
which the onus has shifted.
162.
 
In the surety wife cases it should, in my opinion, be recognised that
undue influence, though a possible explanation for the wife’s agreement to become
surety, is a relatively unlikely one. 
O’Brien
 
itself was a misrepresentation case.
Undue influence had been alleged but the undoubted pressure which the husband
had brought to bear to persuade his reluctant wife to sign was not regarded by the
judge or the Court of Appeal as constituting undue influence. The wife’s will had
not been overborne by her husband. Nor was 
O’Brien
 
a case in which, in my
opinion, there would have been at any stage in the case a presumption of undue
influence.
Commentary
The decision of the House of Lords is one of enormous significance for banks and, to a
lesser extent, solicitors called upon to advise non-commercial parties who agree to
become guarantors. The practical significance of the case lies principally in the practical
guidance given to banks and solicitors in relation to the procedures to be adopted in
such cases. Our principal interest, by contrast, is in the analysis of undue influence. A
number of points can be made.
The first is that their Lordships declined to provide a comprehensive definition of undue
influence. The emphasis was very much on the facts and circumstances of the individual
case (see, for example, [13]). Thus relationships are ‘infinitely various’ ([10]) and no
description of the relevant factors is ‘perfect’ or ‘all embracing’ ([11]). The focus of the
doctrine seems to be rather more on the defendant than the claimant. Thus influence
must not be ‘abused’ ([6]) and undue influence is said to have ‘a connotation of
impropriety’ ([32]). But it may be ‘impropriety’ in an attenuated form, as 
Allcard
 
v.
Skinner
 
suggests, where the ‘impropriety’ apparently took the form of not ensuring that
the plaintiff had access to independent advice before she decided to give away all her
property.
Secondly, their Lordships affirmed the continued existence of a distinction between
cases of actual and presumed undue influence (with the apparent exception of Lord
Clyde at [92]). Lord Nicholls seemed to conceive of actual undue influence in terms of
‘improper pressure or coercion’ so that there was ‘much overlap with the principle of
duress’ ([8]
  
). Lord Hobhouse, on the other hand, defined actual undue influence in
broader terms (see [103]) when he said that it was an ‘equitable wrong’ which typically
consisted of ‘some express conduct overbearing the other party’s will’. The importance
of the distinction should not, however, be over-stated. Actual and presumed undue
influence describe different ways in which undue influence can be established. In the
case of actual undue influence it is exercised by way of some overt act, whereas in a case
of presumed undue influence it is ‘exercised less directly and its existence is inferred
from a consideration of the facts relating to the transaction under consideration and the
relationship of the parties to that transaction’ (
Evans
 
v. 
Lloyd
 
[2013] EWHC 1725 (Ch),
[37]).
Thirdly, the speeches contain much by way of discussion of presumed undue influence,
although they seem to raise more questions than they answer. First, they affirm that the
presumption is a rebuttable evidential presumption (see [16]). Secondly, the future of
‘the class 2B presumption’ is now very doubtful. Lord Hobhouse stated that ‘it should
not be adopted’ ([107]), Lord Scott doubted its utility ([161]), and Lord Clyde was
generally hostile to the use of presumptions ([92]). This being the case, there does not
appear to be much point in leading evidence for the purpose of seeking to raise the
presumption of undue influence. Instead, evidence should be led for the purpose of
proving that undue influence has been exercised. The presumption still has a role to play
in ‘class 2A cases’ and, indeed, Lord Nicholls stated that, in certain relationships, the law
presumes ‘irrebuttably’ that one party had influence over the other (see [18]).
Fourthly, ‘manifest disadvantage’ as a control device may have been replaced by the test
originally adopted by Lindley LJ in 
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
 
(1887) 36 Ch D 145, 185, namely
that the gift must have been so large that it cannot be accounted for on the grounds of
friendship, relationship, charity, or other ordinary motives on which ordinary men act.
This was certainly the view of Lord Nicholls ([29]), although Lord Hobhouse referred to
manifest disadvantage without apparent criticism (at [104]). But it may be that this
change will have little effect in practice. It is a change of label rather than substance. The
courts are simply seeking a label to denote a transaction or a gift which calls for an
explanation.
Fifthly, it was confirmed that the relationship of husband and wife does not give rise to a
presumption of undue influence ([19]).
Sixthly, it is not entirely clear what it is that is being presumed. Is it dependence? Is it
exploitation? The answer would appear to be that there are different presumptions and
that they operate in different ways. Thus certain relationships appear to give rise to a
presumption of trust and confidence or ‘influence’ and, as Lord Nicholls points out, that
presumption may be irrebuttable ([18]). But this does not appear to be the same thing as
the presumption of undue influence. In order to raise the presumption of undue
influence it appears to be necessary to prove both the nature of the relationship between
the parties and that the transaction is one that is not explicable by ordinary motives on
which ordinary people act (see [21]). Once these two elements have been proved the law
then presumes that undue influence has been exercised, unless the contrary is
established. This latter presumption may be better described as a ‘factual inference’ (see
[104]). Thus Lord Hobhouse states that it is the relationship of trust and confidence that
is presumed and that ‘there is no presumption properly so called that the confidence has
been abused’ ([104]). While the court may be willing to draw a ‘factual inference’ that
abuse has taken place in certain cases, it is not the case that the law ‘presumes’ that
abuse has taken place.
The effect of 
Etridge
 
is to make it much more difficult for wives to establish that they
have been the victims of undue influence by their husbands, at least at the trial of the
action (different considerations appear to apply at the interlocutory stage, where the
courts are less likely to strike out the claim as unarguable on a ground that relates to
what has taken place between the husband and the wife). This is evidenced by the
application of the law to the facts of the various cases in the speech of Lord Scott (at
[194]–[374]). At the trial of the action judges are encouraged to examine the facts of the
case in order to decide, 
on the facts
, whether or not undue influence has been exercised
(see, for example, 
Annulment Funding Co Ltd
 
v. 
Cowey
 
[2010] EWCA Civ 711, [2010]
BPIR 1304). Thus Lord Scott stated (at [219]) that in a case ‘where there has been a full
trial … the judge must decide on the totality of the evidence before the court whether or
not the allegation of undue influence has been proved’. Where the allegation takes the
form of actual undue influence, the wife must prove that she has been the subject of
threats or other forms of wrongdoing by her husband. On the other hand, where she
relies on the presumption of undue influence the judge must first of all decide whether
or not the presumption has been triggered and, for that to happen, the wife must prove
that a relationship of trust and confidence exists between the parties and that the
transaction is one that is not explicable by ordinary motives on which ordinary people
act. Wives are likely to find it difficult to prove the conditions necessary to trigger the
operation of the presumption. This is so for two reasons. First, the relationship between
husband and wife does not ordinarily trigger the presumption. However, it is not
impossible. In one of the appeals in 
Etridge
 
the husband and wife were Hasidic Jews
and the wife’s upbringing and education ‘prepared her to expect and to accept a position
of subservience and obedience to the wishes of her husband’ ([283]). In this case Lord
Scott considered that the Court of Appeal had been correct to conclude that the
presumption of undue influence arose on the facts of the case. Secondly, in the ordinary
case, a guarantee by a wife of her husband’s debts can be accounted for on the ground of
their relationship and so does not give rise to an inference of undue influence. It is not a
transaction that calls for an explanation or is inexplicable by reference to the ordinary
motives on which ordinary people act.
Turning now to the circumstances in which the bank is put on inquiry that there is
potential wrongdoing by the husband (or party in a similar position), the threshold
adopted by 
the House of Lords is a low one (the passages from the speech of Lord
Nicholls on this issue can be found in the 
online resources
).
Essentially, the bank is put on inquiry whenever a wife offers to stand surety for her
husband’s debts or the debts of his business, even in the case where she is a shareholder
and participates in the running of the company (but where the advance is made to the
husband and wife jointly the bank is not put on inquiry unless the bank is aware that the
loan is being made for the husband’s purposes, as distinct from their joint purposes; see
[48]). The same principle applies to unmarried couples, whether heterosexual or
homosexual, where the bank is aware of the relationship (see [47]). The bank can also be
put on inquiry where there is a relationship between the parties but that relationship is
not sexual (see, for example, 
Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV
 
v. 
Burch
 
[1997] 1 All
ER 144). This extension potentially gives rise to difficulty in terms of defining the limits
of the circumstances in which the bank is put on inquiry. Lord Nicholls therefore
concluded (at [84]) that the bank is put on inquiry in ‘every case where the relationship
between the surety and the debtor is non-commercial’. In all non-commercial cases the
creditor must take reasonable steps to bring home to the individual guarantor the risks
he is running by standing as surety. The line between commercial and non-commercial
sureties may be indistinct at the margins. Lord Nicholls gave as examples of commercial
sureties cases where the guarantor is being paid a fee or is guaranteeing the debts of
another company in the same group (see [88]). But in the vast majority of cases the
distinction between a commercial and a non-commercial surety should not create
difficulties in practice.
In relation to the steps to be taken by the bank once it has been put on inquiry, Lord
Nicholls provided the banks with guidance at [79] of his speech. One point to note is
that the bank is not required to meet with the wife and explain to her the nature of the
transaction before she enters into it. It suffices for the bank to satisfy itself that the wife
has been advised by her own solicitor. In many ways the obligations imposed on
solicitors are more onerous than those imposed on banks. This leads us to the final issue
which relates to the role of solicitors. As Lord Nicholls observed at [52] many of the
difficulties that have arisen in this area ‘stem from serious deficiencies, or alleged
deficiencies, in the quality of the legal advice given to wives’. He concluded that
independent legal advice for wives had been a ‘fiction’ and a ‘charade’. The guidance
given by Lord Nicholls in [65] and [74] is clearly designed to provide more effective
protection for wives by ensuring, as far as possible, that they have access to reliable,
independent advice before they decide whether or not to act as guarantors of their
husband’s debts. Whether that protection will prove to be effective in the real world is,
of course, another matter.

The Post-
Etridge
 
Cases
The cases post-
Etridge
 
continue to exhibit some uncertainty as to the basis of the
doctrine of undue influence. Three cases in particular are worthy of note. The first two
(
R
 
v. 
Attorney-General for England and Wales
 
[2003] UKPC 22 and 
National
Commercial Bank (Jamaica) Ltd
 
v. 
Hew
 
[2003] UKPC 51) are decisions of the Privy
Council, while the third (
Pesticcio
 
v. 
Huet
 
[2004] EWCA Civ 372, [2004] All ER (D) 36
(Apr)) is a decision of the Court of Appeal. The former two cases incline towards a
defendant-oriented conception of undue influence, whereas the latter very much
supports a claimant-oriented perception. There is a risk in setting up the cases in this
way that the impression is given that the courts must choose either a claimant-sided
version of undue influence or a defendant-sided version. However, there is 
no necessary
need to restrict the choice in this way. It is possible to conclude that both elements are
relevant and that the task of the court is in all cases to weigh the evidence before it when
deciding whether or not undue influence has been established on the facts. We shall now
turn to consider each case in turn.
19.4.1
 
R
 
v. 
Attorney-General for England and
Wales
The first case is the decision of the Privy Council in 
R
 
v. 
Attorney-General for England
and Wales
 
[2003] UKPC 22. The appellant, known simply as ‘R’, was a member of the
SAS and, during the Gulf War of 1991, he was a member of the Bravo Two Zero patrol
that was dropped behind enemy lines in Iraq in order to find Scud missiles and cut
communication lines. After the war was over there was considerable concern within the
SAS, and the Ministry of Defence more generally, about books written by former
members of the SAS in which they gave an account (the accuracy of which was
contested) of their experience as members of the Bravo Two Zero patrol. The Ministry of
Defence decided to respond to this state of affairs by requiring existing SAS members to
sign a confidentiality contract under which the soldiers covenanted, inter alia, not to
‘disclose without express prior authority in writing from MOD any information,
document or other article relating to the work of, or in support of, the United Kingdom
Special Forces which is, or has been in my possession by virtue of my position as a
member of any of those Forces’.
The appellant signed the contract but shortly afterwards left the Army, having applied
for premature voluntary release. He returned to his native New Zealand and in 1998 he
entered into a contract with New Zealand publishers for the publication of his own
account of life as a member of the Bravo Two Zero patrol. The New Zealand publishers
offered the UK rights to Hodder & Stoughton, who passed a copy of the manuscript on
to the Ministry of Defence. The Attorney-General, on behalf of the Crown, then
commenced proceedings in the High Court of New Zealand, in which he sought an
injunction to restrain publication of the book, damages, and an account of profits. The
New Zealand Court of Appeal refused to grant an injunction to restrain publication of
the book, but made an order for an account of profits and an assessment of damages.
The appellant appealed to the Privy Council.
The appellant defended the Crown’s claim for damages and an account of profits on a
number of grounds, one of which was that the confidentiality contract had been
obtained as a result of the exercise of undue influence. The Privy Council, by a majority,
rejected his claim. Lord Hoffmann, giving the judgment of the majority, stated:
21. The subject of undue influence has recently been re-examined in depth by the House of Lords in 
Royal Bank
of Scotland plc
 
v. 
Etridge (No 2)
 
[2002] AC 773. Their Lordships summarise the effect of the judgments. Like
duress at common law, undue influence is based upon the principle that a transaction to which consent has
been obtained by unacceptable means should not be allowed to stand. Undue influence has concentrated in
particular upon the unfair exploitation by one party of a relationship which gives him ascendancy or influence
over the other.
22.
 
The burden of proving that consent was obtained by unacceptable means is upon the party who alleges
it. Certain relationships—parent and child, trustee and beneficiary, etc—give rise to a presumption that one
party had influence over the other. That does not of course in itself involve a presumption that he unfairly
exploited his influence. But if the transaction is one which cannot reasonably be explained by the relationship,
that will be prima facie evidence of undue influence. Even if the relationship does not fall into one of the
established categories, the evidence may show that one party did in fact have influence over the other. In such a
case, the nature of the transaction may likewise give rise to a prima facie inference that it was obtained by
undue influence. In the absence of contrary evidence, the court will be entitled to find that the burden of
proving unfair exploitation of the relationship has been discharged.
23.
 
The absence of independent legal advice may or may not be a relevant matter according to the
circumstances. It is not necessarily an unfair exploitation of a relationship for one party to enter into a
transaction with the other without ensuring that he has obtained independent legal advice. On the other hand,
the transaction may be such as to give rise to an inference of undue influence even if the induced party was
advised by an independent lawyer and understood the legal implications of what he was doing.
This summary is important for a number of reasons. First, it attempts to draw an
analogy between undue influence and common law duress. Secondly, there is an
emphasis on ‘unacceptable means’ and ‘unfair exploitation’ which suggests that the
focus of attention is upon the conduct of the defendant rather than the state of mind of
the claimant. Thirdly, the presumption to which certain relationships give rise is that
‘one party had influence over the other’; it is not a ‘presumption that he unfairly
exploited his influence’.
For the purposes of the hearing, their Lordships were content to assume that the Army
was able to exercise influence over the appellant. The vital question was whether ‘the
nature of the transaction was such as to give rise to an inference that it was obtained by
an unfair exploitation of that relationship’. On this point Lord Hoffmann concluded (at
[24]):
Like the Court of Appeal, their Lordships do not think that the confidentiality agreement can be so described. As
in the case of duress, their Lordships think that the finding that it was an agreement which anyone who wished
to serve or continue serving in the SAS could reasonably have been required to sign is fatal to such a conclusion.
The reason why R signed the agreement was because, at the time, he wished to continue to be a member of the
SAS. If facing him with such a choice was not illegitimate for the purposes of duress, their Lordships do not
think that it could have been an unfair exploitation of a relationship which consisted in his being a member of
the SAS. There seems to their Lordships to be some degree of contradiction between R’s claim, in the context of
duress, that he signed only because he was threatened with return to his unit and his claim, for the purposes of
undue influence, that he signed because of the trust and confidence which he reposed in the Army or his
commanding officer.
The issue which troubled the majority was ‘the absence of legal advice’. But the lack of
independent advice, while ‘a matter for regret’, did not result in the transaction being
one in which the Ministry of Defence had unfairly exploited its influence over the
appellant. 
The majority concluded that there had been no such exploitation. The
appellant did not contend that he did not understand the nature of the transaction into
which he had entered. Further, the absence of legal advice did not affect the fairness of
the transaction. The most that the appellant could say was that a ‘lawyer might have
advised him to reflect upon the matter and … that might have led to his not signing at
all’ but that was a decision which he could have made without a lawyer’s advice. The
appellant’s attempt to invoke undue influence therefore failed.
Lord Scott dissented in relation to the application of the principles of undue influence to
(1)
(2)
(3)
the facts of the case. He drew heavily upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Allcard
v. 
Skinner
 
(1887) 36 Ch D 145 (
19.3
) and continued:
41. Are these principles ones that should be applied to the contract in the present case? I think they are. The
appellant was not, of course, an unworldly man in a secluded religious order. He was a soldier in a highly
trained and efficient fighting unit. The essence of efficiency in a military unit is obedience to orders. The Armed
Services operate on a hierarchical basis. Each rank looks to the rank or ranks above for direction and, having
received that direction, is expected to comply with it. It is, in my opinion, entirely artificial to draw sharp
distinctions between orders from senior officers that are military orders breach of which will be an offence
under military law and may attract court martial sanctions and ‘orders’ from senior officers couched as requests
or as recommendations. It has become a music-hall joke for a sergeant-major to say to the troops under him ‘I
want three volunteers; you, you and you’. The hierarchical culture of the Armed Services and the deference and
obedience to senior officers, both commissioned and non-commissioned, which is part of that culture are the
essential background to the circumstances in which the appellant was asked to sign the contract in the present
case …
44.
 
The circumstances in which the contract in the present case came to be signed by the appellant were the
subject of evidence at trial and the trial judge, Salmon J, formed a number of important conclusions:
The judge concluded that the appellant signed because he had been ordered to do so. An analysis of the
‘order’ that disqualifies it from constituting a military order and regards it, no doubt correctly, merely as
a recommendation or a direction is, in my opinion, of no more than marginal significance if the
possibility of undue influence is being considered. What is important is how the appellant regarded it.
The appellant regarded it as an order.
The judge found that ‘the defendant was not told the terms of the contract before signing [and] was not
offered any legal advice’ (para 39).
He found, also, that the appellant was not permitted to show the contract to a legal adviser (para 139).
The weight of this finding is not diminished by evidence from the senior officer in command of the
Regiment to the effect that soldiers would have been permitted to show the contract to approved legal
advisers if they had asked. What is important is the perception of the appellant, and, as to that, Salmon
J’s finding stands.
45. In my opinion, the relationship between the appellant and his senior officers and the circumstances, as
found by the judge, in which the contract came to be signed by the appellant produced a classic ‘relationship’
case in which undue influence should be presumed. No evidence was introduced to rebut that presumption.
Legal advice was not available to the appellant. As in 
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
, where no suggestion of fraud or indeed
any impropriety was made against the lady superior to whom the plaintiff had transferred her assets, no such
suggestion has been, or could be, made against any of the appellant’s senior officers who play a part in the story.
It is the relationship, produced by the background to which I have referred, between a soldier and that part of
the Armed Services of which he is a member, that introduces the potentially vitiating element into the contract.
If the Ministry of Defence wants to impose contractual obligations on soldiers by which they will be bound when
they leave the service, it must, in my opinion, at the least make available to them independent legal advice.
Fairness, in my view, requires it and I think the law requires it. In this case it was not done. I would have
allowed the appeal.
The difference between the analysis of Lord Scott and that employed by the majority
appears to lie in the fact that Lord Scott focused on the nature of the relationship
between the parties, whereas the majority placed greater emphasis on the need for some
wrongdoing on the part of the Ministry of Defence. While the majority were prepared to
assume that the Army was able to exercise influence over the appellant, they found that
the facts of the case ‘did not give rise to an inference that [the transaction] was obtained
by an unfair exploitation of that relationship’. Lord Scott, by contrast, had regard to the
nature of the relationship between the appellant and the Army and, from that
relationship, was prepared to infer the existence of undue influence without the need to
identify specific wrongdoing on the part of the Army. In his view the nature of the
relationship between the parties imposed certain obligations on the Army, for example
to provide independent legal advice, and their failure to discharge these obligations,
should, in his opinion, have entitled the appellant to succeed with his undue influence
claim.
19.4.2
 
National Commercial Bank (Jamaica) Ltd
v. 
Hew
The second case is the decision of the Privy Council in 
National Commercial Bank
(Jamaica) Ltd
 
v. 
Hew
 
[2003] UKPC 51. Lord Millett there described the doctrine of
undue influence in the following terms:
29. Undue influence is one of the grounds on which equity intervenes to give redress where there has been some
unconscionable conduct on the part of the defendant. It arises whenever one party has acted unconscionably by
exploiting the influence to direct the conduct of another which he has obtained from the relationship between
them …
30.
 
Thus the doctrine involves two elements. First, there must be a relationship capable of giving rise to the
necessary influence. And secondly the influence generated by the relationship must have been abused.
31.
 
The necessary relationship is variously described as a relationship ‘of trust and confidence’ or ‘of
ascendancy and dependency’. Such a relationship may be proved or presumed. Some relationships are
presumed to generate the necessary influence; examples are solicitor and client and medical adviser and
patient. The banker-customer relationship does not fall within this category. But the existence of the necessary
relationship may be proved as a fact in any particular case …
33.
 
But the second element is also necessary. However great the influence which one person may be able to
wield over another equity does not intervene unless that influence has been abused. Equity does not save people
from the consequences of their own folly; it acts to save them from being victimised by other people: see 
Allcard
v. 
Skinner
 
(1887) 36 Ch D 145, 182.
34.
 
Thus it must be shown that the ascendant party has unfairly exploited the influence he is shown or
presumed to possess over the vulnerable party. It is always highly relevant that the transaction in question was
manifestly disadvantageous to the person seeking to set it aside; though this is not always necessary: see 
CIBC
Mortgages plc
 
v. 
Pitt
 
[1994] 1 AC 200. But ‘disadvantageous’ in this context means ‘disadvantageous’ as
between the parties. Unless the ascendant party has exploited his influence to obtain some unfair advantage
from the vulnerable party there is no ground for equity to intervene. However commercially disadvantageous
the transaction may be to the vulnerable party, equity will not set it aside if it is a fair transaction as between the
parties to it.
Once again we can see the emphasis placed on the conduct of the party who is alleged to
have exercised the undue influence. It does not suffice to prove that a relationship of
trust and confidence existed between the parties. Nor does it suffice to demonstrate that
the transaction was a disadvantageous one for the party seeking to set it aside. It must
be demonstrated that there was some advantage-taking on the part of the party who is
seeking to uphold the agreement. The nature of that advantage-taking is described in
various terms by Lord Millett. Thus he refers to ‘abuse’ (at [30]), ‘victimisation’ (at [33]),
and ‘exploitation’ (at [34]). From this case, together with 
Etridge
 
and 
R
 
v. 
Attorney-
General for England and Wales
, it can be inferred that undue influence is defendant-
sided in its emphasis so that some form of wrongdoing on the part of the party alleged to
have exercised undue influence would appear to be an indispensable element of an
undue influence claim (albeit the wrongdoing can assume different forms).
This emphasis on wrongdoing has not been universally welcomed. Professor Birks
((2004) 120 
LQR
 
34) sounded a warning in relation to the difficulties that were likely to
arise from an insistence on wrongdoing in all cases. In particular, while the emphasis on
wrongdoing may open the prospect of the award of compensatory damages in an undue
influence claim, it may also shut out the possibility of relief in the case where the
claimant cannot establish wrongdoing on the part of the defendant. 
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
(
19.3
) may well come into this category (notwithstanding Lord Millett’s citation of
Allcard
 
in support of his analysis in 
Hew
 
at [33]). This is important where the claimant
seeks relief in the form of rescission of the contract. In such a case, why does the
claimant have to prove some element of wrongdoing on the part of the defendant? There
is no such requirement in the law of misrepresentation where, as has been noted (see
17.4.1
), an innocent misrepresentation gives rise to a right to rescind and innocent
misrepresentation is not a wrong which attracts compensatory damages. Similarly,
Professor Birks asserted that not all cases of undue influence can be regarded as cases of
wrongs (an example which he cited in addition to 
Allcard
 
is 
Hammond
 
v. 
Osborn
 
(on
which see 
19.1
)). He therefore maintained that English law should continue to recognize
a category of ‘innocent undue influence’ (that is to say the claimant is subject to too
much influence in the sense that his volition is impaired but there is no advantage-
taking by the defendant). He concluded (at p. 37) as follows:
As with misrepresentation, undue influence may be a wrong in aggravating circumstances. That is largely
unexplored territory. It is certainly not always a wrong. A party who makes no claim to shift a loss from himself
to another but merely requires that other to return to the 
status quo
 
does not need to find and prove those extra
facts. A misrepresentee can rely for that same limited purpose on an innocent misrepresentation whether
because the representation really was innocent or because he does not need to and does not choose to prove the
aggravating facts. The same applies to one whose autonomy is impaired by the fact that another has excessive
influence over him. It would be odd if, in triggering rescission and return to the 
status quo
, relational paralysis
were less potent than misrepresentation.
19.4.3
 
Pesticcio
 
v. 
Huet
This point was taken up in clear terms by Mummery LJ in our third case, which is the
decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Pesticcio
 
v. 
Huet
 
[2004] EWCA Civ 372, [2004] All
ER (D) 36 (Apr). Mummery LJ (at [20]) objected to the defendant-sided conception of
undue influence in the following terms:
The insistence of [counsel] that Maureen [the person alleged to have exercised undue influence over her
brother] had ‘done nothing wrong’ is an instance of the ‘continuing misconceptions’ mentioned by Sir Martin
Nourse in 
Hammond
 
about the circumstances in which gifts will be set aside on the ground of presumed undue
influence. Although undue influence is sometimes described as an ‘equitable wrong’ or even as a species of
equitable fraud, the basis of the court’s intervention is not the commission of a dishonest or wrongful act by the
defendant, but that, as a matter of public policy, the presumed influence arising from the relationship of trust
and confidence should not operate to the disadvantage of the victim, if the transaction is not satisfactorily
explained by ordinary motives: 
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
 
(1887) 36 Ch D 145 at 171. The court scrutinises the
circumstances in which the transaction, under which benefits were conferred on the recipient, took place and
the nature of the continuing relationship between the parties, rather than any specific act or conduct on the part
of the recipient. A transaction may be set aside by the court, even though the actions and conduct of the person
who benefits from it could not be criticised as wrongful. The presumption arising from the trust and confidence
of their relationship made it unnecessary, for example, for Bernard [the party seeking to set aside the deed of
gift] to prove that Maureen actually had influence over him in relation to the gift of the house, let alone that she
in fact exercised undue influence or applied improper pressure to obtain the Deed of Gift.
19.4.4
 
Conclusion
Where do we stand in the light of these cases? The vast majority of undue influence
cases will involve some advantage-taking on the part of the defendant in connection
with a relationship of trust that exists between the claimant and the defendant (albeit
that the advantage-taking will assume different forms). But we should not exclude the
possibility that, exceptionally, a claimant may be able to demonstrate that he or she was
so dependent 
upon the defendant that a finding of undue influence can be made, even in
the absence of specific wrongdoing on the part of the defendant. In other words, undue
influence may require a court to focus attention on the claimant’s state of mind 
and
 
the
conduct of the defendant. That is to say it may require a court to consider the nature of
the relationship that existed between the claimant and the defendant and to analyse the
appropriateness of the transaction, the claimant’s motivation, and the defendant’s
behaviour in the context of that relationship (M Chen-Wishart, ‘Undue Influence:
Beyond Impaired Consent and Wrongdoing Towards a Relational Analysis’ in A Burrows

Unconscionability and Inequality of
Bargaining Power
Central Issues
The role of fairness in the law of contract is a matter of some
controversy. It is clear that the law is concerned with matters of
procedural fairness, although the extent of that concern and the
meaning of procedural fairness is a matter of debate. More difficult is
the role of substantive fairness. Can a court set aside a contract on the
ground that it is substantively unfair or is the function of substantive
unfairness confined to the provision of evidence from which some
other ground of invalidity can be deduced?
In this chapter consideration will be given to a range of cases in which
the courts were asked to set aside a contract on the ground that the
contract was, in some way, unfair. An examination of the cases will
reveal that the courts have invoked a range of factors in deciding
whether or not to set aside a contract. These factors include matters
such as the existence of a special or serious disadvantage or disability
on the part of the party seeking to set aside the contract, actual or
constructive fraud on the part of the party seeking to enforce the
contract, the role of independent advice, and the presence of
disadvantageous terms.
It is also necessary to examine the role of Parliament in regulating
unfair terms and the reasons why the courts have so far refused to
recognize a general doctrine of unconscionability or inequality of
bargaining power. The chapter will conclude by drawing on various
analyses of unconscionability and the role of substantive fairness in
the law of contract.
20.1
 
Introduction
There is no doubt that the law recognizes that duress and undue influence can suffice to
set aside a contract (see 
Chapters 18
 
and 
19
). More difficult is the question whether or
not a court can set aside a contract on the ground that it is in some way unfair. Does
English law recognize a doctrine of unconscionability or inequality of bargaining power?
The House of 
Lords in 
National Westminster Bank
 
v. 
Morgan
 
[1985] AC 686 (
20.4
) saw
no need for a general doctrine of inequality of bargaining power (a view confirmed by
the Supreme Court in 
Pakistan International Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK)
Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3 WLR 727, [26]). Nevertheless, specific instances can be
found of cases in which courts have intervened to set aside a contract that was, in the
view of the court, unfair. The exact scope of these decisions is the subject of some
debate. A further issue is whether or not the law ought to bring these disparate cases
together and form one coherent doctrine. Lord Denning attempted to do this in 
Lloyds
Bank Ltd
 
v. 
Bundy
 
[1975] QB 326 (
20.4
) but his attempt was rejected by the House of
Lords in 
National Westminster Bank
 
v. 
Morgan
 
[1985] AC 686.
In so far as these decisions are based on the unfairness of the procedure by which the
contract was concluded they are not particularly controversial. The laws of
misrepresentation and duress demonstrate that the law of contract is concerned with
the fairness of the procedure by which a contract has been concluded. Much more
difficulty is created by the proposition that the law of contract is concerned with the
substantive fairness of the terms of the contract, particularly the adequacy or the
fairness of the price. The fairness of the terms is a matter for the parties to decide, not
the courts. The latter proposition is a fundamental tenet of freedom of contract. Can a
commitment to the fairness of the terms be reconciled with a commitment to freedom of
contract? Professor Collins, 
The Law of Contract
 
(4th edn, Butterworths, 2003), pp.
270–271 has stated:
A system of contract law committed to freedom of contract must reject controls over the fairness of contracts.
No matter that the purchaser has paid an excessive price or the seller received a gross undervalue, the principle
of freedom to select the terms must prohibit intervention designed to redress the balance of obligations. At most
the law can scrutinize minutely the procedures leading up to the contract to ensure that the freedom of the
parties was not restricted by pressure, fraud, abuse of positions of trust, and other factors which interfered with
the voluntariness of consent. Tests of procedural propriety are both compatible with and required by the
principle of freedom of contract, but any examination of the fairness of the substance of the contract must be
forbidden. Accordingly, texts describing the classical law of contract offered no place for a discussion of a
requirement of fairness in contracts.
A reluctance to acknowledge the significance of substantive unfairness in contracts as a ground for
intervention still characterises judicial decisions in the common law. A court will stress any elements of
procedural impropriety that it can discover rather than address directly the unfairness of the bargain. The
substantive unfairness may provide the motive for intervention, but the formal legal reason given for upsetting
the contract will be couched in terms of a procedural defect, such as deception, manipulation or unfair surprise.
This approach receives further support from economic analysis of law, since these procedural defects can be
regarded as evidence of market failure which prevented the operation of a competitive and efficient market. To
discover the real significance of substantive unfairness in the common law of contract therefore requires an
investigation which digs behind the formal reasons given for decisions.
In this chapter it will be necessary to ‘dig behind the formal reasons given for decisions’
in order to ascertain the reason for the intervention of the court in the cases that have
been extracted in the 
online resources
 
which support this book. The most difficult
issue relates to the role of the substantive unfairness of the term or terms of the
contract. What role, if any, does a concern for substantive fairness play in the cases? And
what is the role of procedural fairness? Is there any one factor that predominates or do
the courts rely upon a mixture of 
factors? Academic analyses of the cases often draw
upon a mixture of factors. Thus Nicholas Bamforth (
20.5
) identifies four factors that are
consistently taken into account by the courts (namely, (i) special or serious disadvantage
or disability, (ii) actual or constructive fraud, (iii) lack of independent advice, and (iv)
disadvantageous terms) while David Capper (
20.5
) identifies three factors (namely, (i)
relational inequality, (ii) transactional imbalance, and (iii) unconscionable conduct). It
may be that it is impossible to locate one factor which alone can explain all the cases and
that the multi-factor approach is the best one to adopt. But such an approach has its
dangers in that different courts can give different weight to the various factors with the
consequence that the cases develop in an inconsistent and haphazard fashion.
This chapter will proceed in four stages. First, brief consideration will be given to a
group of cases in which the courts have been asked to grant relief on the basis that the
contract concluded between the parties was, in some way, unfair. Secondly, we shall
outline one or two examples of the statutory regulation of unfair terms. Then, thirdly,
consideration will be given to the arguments in favour of drawing these disparate cases
together into one general doctrine before concluding the chapter by drawing on some
academic reflections on the case-law and the role of fairness in the law of contract more
generally.
20.2
 
Unfairness in the Cases
There are a number of cases in which the courts have set aside a contract on the ground
that it was, in some way, unfair. These cases can be grouped into a number of categories
but it cannot be said that these categories are watertight. Extracts from the judgments in
the principal cases referred to in this section can be found in the 
online resources
which support this book. Here we shall confine ourselves to a brief account of the cases
and of the grounds on which they were decided and to one example of the way in which
the courts exercise this jurisdiction.
The first group of cases concerns the protection which equity has long afforded to
‘expectant heirs’ (that is to say young men who would inherit a substantial fortune on
the death of their father but who had very limited immediate access to cash and were
thus vulnerable to exploitation by moneylenders). A leading example is 
Earl of
Aylesford
 
v. 
Morris
 
(1873) 8 Ch App 484. The plaintiff, when he was a young man of 22,
had run up a large number of debts. His father was in poor health and he stood to
inherit a large amount of property on the death of his father. His creditors were pressing
for payment and the defendant moneylender agreed to lend him money to pay off these
debts. The plaintiff received no independent advice and the rate of interest which the
defendant demanded was over 60 per cent. The plaintiff applied to have the defendant’s
actions for payment restrained and succeeded in doing so. It was held that, in the
circumstances of the case, the transaction could not stand unless the defendant could
repel the presumption that it had been procured unconscientiously by proving that the
transaction with the plaintiff was fair, just, and reasonable. This the defendant was
unable to do.
The second group of cases concerns the protection which English law has traditionally
afforded to what have been termed ‘poor and ignorant persons’. The leading case is 
Fry
v. 
Lane
 
(1888) 40 Ch D 312. The plaintiffs were two brothers. One was a laundryman
and the other worked for a plumber. They sold their reversionary interests in the estate
of John Fry to the defendant for £170 and £270, respectively. When they entered into
the transaction, they were 
advised by an inexperienced solicitor who was acting for both
parties to the transaction. The property which was the subject of their interest was later
sold for £3,848, of which the plaintiffs’ share would have been £730 each. The proceeds
of the sale were paid into court. An actuary stated that JB Fry’s contingent interest in the
£730 would have been valued at £475 at the date of the transaction. The plaintiffs’ claim
to set aside the transaction with the defendant was successful. There were three
elements to the decision of Kay J: (i) the plaintiffs were ‘poor and ignorant’, (ii) the sale
was at an undervalue, and (iii) the plaintiffs were not independently advised. Proof of
these three matters suffices to shift the onus of proof on to the defendant to prove that
the transaction was fair, just, and reasonable and, once again, the defendant was unable
to do this. A more modern example of the exercise of the same jurisdiction is provided
by 
Creswell
 
v. 
Potter
 
[1978] 1 WLR 255. On the break-up of her marriage to the
defendant, the plaintiff, a telephonist, released and conveyed to the defendant her
interest in the matrimonial home in return for an indemnity against liability under the
mortgage. The defendant later sold the former matrimonial home and made a profit of
£1,400 on the sale. The plaintiff sought to set aside the release on the ground that it was
exercised in circumstances which amounted to unfair dealing. Her claim was successful.
She established that she was ‘poor’ (in the sense that she was a member of ‘the lower
income group’) and ‘ignorant’ (which for this purpose meant ‘less highly educated’), that
the sale was at a considerable undervalue, and that she had not received any
independent advice. The defendant was unable to prove that the transaction was fair,
just, and reasonable (for a further example, see 
Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV
 
v.
Burch
 
[1997] 1 All ER 144).
Thirdly, cases can be found in which the courts have intervened to protect claimants
who have found themselves in extremely difficult circumstances and the defendant has
attempted to exploit that situation. An example in this category is 
The Medina
 
(1876) 1 P
272. Here the plaintiffs sought to take advantage of the imminent danger in which the
master of a vessel and some pilgrims found themselves. Their vessel had been wrecked
and they were huddled on a rock, awaiting rescue. The plaintiffs declined to rescue the
pilgrims unless they were paid £4,000. The defendants, not having any other alternative
open to them (other than death), promised to pay this sum. When the plaintiffs sued to
recover the promised amount, the court declined to order the defendants to pay and,
instead, relegated the plaintiffs to a claim for £1,800 (for another example of a court
intervening to set aside an extortionate salvage agreement, see 
The Port Caledonia and
The Anna
 
[1903] P 184).
But the courts have generally been slow to grant relief in cases of alleged unfairness. As
Dillon LJ observed in 
Alec Lobb (Garages) Ltd
 
v. 
Total Oil (Great Britain) Ltd
 
[1985] 1
WLR 173, 183: ‘[t]he courts would only interfere in exceptional cases where as a matter
of common fairness it was not right that the strong should be allowed to push the weak
to the wall.’ To similar effect is the judgment of Rose J in 
The Libyan Investment
Authority
 
v. 
Goldman Sachs International
 
[2016] EWHC 2530 (Ch), [132], where she
observed that ‘generally speaking the law will not intervene to save people from making
improvident bargains’. Before ‘the court will consider setting a contract aside as an
unconscionable bargain, one party has to have been disadvantaged in some relevant way
as regards the other party, that other party must have exploited that disadvantage in
some morally culpable manner, and the resulting transaction must be overreaching and
oppressive’ (
Strydom
 
v. 
Vendside Ltd
 
[2009] EWHC 2130 (QB), [39]). All of these
elements must be present before a contract will be set aside as an unconscionable
bargain. No one factor will suffice. In particular, it is insufficient for the claimant to
establish that the bargain was a hard one or in some other way improvident; it is
necessary to go further and establish that the defendant took advantage of the claimant’s
position (
Fineland Investments Ltd
 
v. 
Pritchard
 
[2011] EWHC 113 (Ch), [2011] All ER
(D) 18 (Feb)).
The most recent authoritative summary of the various jurisdictions to set aside a
contract which are discussed in this section was provided by the Supreme Court in
Pakistan International Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK) Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40,
[2021] 3 WLR 727. Thus Lord Hodge stated (at [23]–[24]):
Unconscionability is not an overarching criterion to be applied across the board without regard to context. Were
it so, judges would become arbiters of what is morally and socially acceptable. Equity takes account of the
factual and legal context of a case and has identified specific contexts which call for judicial intervention to
protect the weaker party. For example …
the equitable doctrine of unconscionable bargains has been applied where B is at a serious disadvantage
relative to A through ‘poverty, or ignorance, or lack of advice or otherwise’ so that circumstances existed of
which unfair advantage could be taken; A exploited B’s weakness in a morally culpable manner; and the
resulting transaction was not merely hard or improvident but overreaching and oppressive: 
Alec Lobb
(Garages) Ltd
 
v. 
Total Oil (Great Britain) Ltd
 
[1983] 1 WLR 87, 94–95, per Peter Millett QC, sitting as a deputy
High Court judge. … Examples of unconscionable transactions include circumstances in which A knowingly
negotiates an agreement with B while B is elderly, unwell and intoxicated (
Blomley
 
v. 
Ryan
 
(1954) 99 CLR 362)
and where a poor, illiterate and unwell person is induced to enter into a disadvantageous transaction without
advice and in great haste (
Clark
 
v. 
Malpas
 
(1862) 4 De GF & J 401; 45 ER 1238). In 
Fry
 
v. 
Lane
 
(1888) 40 Ch D
312, Kay J summarised the then existing case-law in these terms (p 322): ‘where a purchase is made from a poor
and ignorant man at a considerable undervalue, the vendor having no independent advice, a Court of Equity
will set aside the transaction.’ He held that the circumstances of poverty, ignorance and lack of independent
advice impose on the purchaser the burden of showing that the purchase was fair, just and reasonable. Unequal
bargaining power does not suffice; it is necessary for the claimant to show that unconscientious advantage has
been taken of his or her disabling condition or circumstances: 
Boustany
 
v. 
Pigott
 
(1993) 69 P & CR 298 (JCPC)
at p 303 per Lord Templeman. Extortionate bargains can be struck down or varied in other circumstances; see,
for example, 
The Port Caledonia and the Anna
 
[1903] P 184 in which the court drastically reduced a claim for
salvage where a ship’s captain in an emergency had been forced to accept an extortionate offer from a tug
captain for the provision of salvage services. But the rules relating to salvage may depend on specialties of
maritime law. …
To similar effect is the following passage from the judgment of Lord Burrows (at [77]):
[T]he law on ‘unconscionable bargains’ … deals not with illegitimate threats or pressure but with the
exploitation by A of a weakness of B by entering into a contract that is clearly disadvantageous to B who has not
obtained independent advice. In almost all past English cases on unconscionable bargains, B has been an
individual with a mental weakness such as inexperience, confusion because of old age or emotional strain: see,
eg, 
Earl of Aylesford
 
v. 
Morris
 
(1873) 8 Ch App 484; 
Fry
 
v. 
Lane
 
(1888) 40 Ch D 312; 
Cresswell
 
v. 
Potter
(Note)
 
[1978] 1 WLR 255; 
Backhouse
 
v. 
Backhouse
 
[1978] 1 WLR 243; 
Boustany
 
v. 
Pigott
 
(1993) 69 P & CR
298; 
Chitty on Contracts
, 33rd ed (2018), paras 8-132 to 8-142. But it is not inconceivable that the relevant
weakness could be the very weak bargaining position of a company; and this possibility was recognised 35 years
ago by the Court of Appeal in 
Alec Lobb Garages Ltd
 
v. 
Total Oil (Great Britain) Ltd
 
[1985] 1 WLR 173.
The cumulative nature of the tests applied by the courts, combined with their stringent
requirements, has the consequence that very few modern examples can be found of
contracts which have been set aside on the ground of unconscionability. One such
exceptional case is:
BOUSTANY V. PIGOTT
(1995) 69 P & CR 298, Privy Council
In 1977 Miss Pigott leased property to Mrs Boustany for a period of five years at a
monthly rent of $833.33. Miss Pigott was ‘quite slow’, and her affairs were
managed by her cousin, George Pigott. In 1980 Mrs Boustany discussed the
possibility of a new lease with George Pigott but no agreement was reached. Later
that year, while George Pigott was away, Mrs Boustany went to the chambers of a
certain Mr Kendall and presented him with a copy of a new lease which was for ten
years at a monthly rent of $1,000, renewable at the same rent at the option of Mrs
Boustany. Mr Kendall demanded to see Miss Pigott together with Mr and Mrs
Boustany and, during the course of the interview, he pointed out to Miss Pigott
various aspects of the agreement which were not in her best interests but she
insisted that he draw up the agreement. He did so. When George Pigott
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
discovered what had happened he protested to Mrs Boustany, who was unmoved
and so he asked for a declaration that the lease was an unconscionable bargain
which should be declared null and void. The Privy Council, upholding the decision
of the Court of Appeal of the Eastern Caribbean States, set aside the lease as an
unconscionable bargain.
Lord Templeman
[giving the judgment of the Privy Council]
In a careful and thoughtful submission, Mr Robertson, who appeared before the
Board on behalf of Mrs Boustany, made the following submissions with which their
Lordships are in general agreement:
It is not sufficient to attract the jurisdiction of equity to prove that a bargain
is hard, unreasonable or foolish; it must be proved to be unconscionable, in
the sense that ‘one of the parties to it has imposed the objectionable terms
in a morally reprehensible manner, that is to say, in a way which affects his
conscience’: 
Multiservice Bookbinding
 
v.

‘Unconscionable’ relates not merely to the terms of the bargain but to the
behaviour of the stronger party, which must be characterised by some
moral culpability or impropriety: 
Lobb (Alec) (Garages) Limited
 
v. 
Total Oil
(Great Britain) Limited
 
[1983] 1 WLR 87, 94.
Unequal bargaining power or objectively unreasonable terms provide no
basis for equitable interference in the absence of unconscientious or
extortionate abuse of power where exceptionally, and as a matter of
common fairness, ‘it was not right that the strong should be allowed to push
the weak to the wall’: 
Lobb (Alec) (Garages) Limited
 
v. 
Total Oil (Great
Britain) Limited
 
[1985] 1 WLR 173, 183.
A contract cannot be set aside in equity as ‘an unconscionable bargain’
against a party innocent of actual or constructive fraud. Even if the terms of
the contract are ‘unfair’ in the sense that they are more favourable to one
party than the other (‘contractual imbalance’), equity will not provide relief
unless the beneficiary is guilty of unconscionable conduct:

Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd
 
v. 
Amadio
 
(1983) 46 ALR 402, 413.
Mr Robertson submitted that Miss Pigott had received independent advice from Mr
Kendall, that she had been made aware by Mr Kendall that the terms of the 1980
lease were disadvantageous to her, that Miss Pigott could not be described as
poor or ignorant and that the judge did not find and could not, consistently with the
evidence, have found unconscionable behaviour on the part of Mrs Boustany.
The crucial question in this case is—what brought Miss Pigott to the chambers
of Mr Kendall in September 1980? That question was not answered by direct
evidence because Miss Pigott was not able to give evidence and Mrs Boustany
and her husband chose not to do so. The trial judge inferred unconscionable
conduct by Mrs Boustany after careful consideration of a number of features which
he held were only consistent with unconscientious conduct on the part of Mrs
Boustany. The management of the property had been given up by Miss Pigott
because of her incapacity. The properties were managed by Mr George Pigott and
there was no reason why Miss Pigott should interfere in the management of this
one property leased to Mrs Boustany. There was no evidence of any personal
attachment between Miss Pigott and her tenant. Mrs Boustany had negotiated with
Mr George Pigott and knew that he was the representative of Miss Pigott. No
advice was sought by Miss Pigott; she turned up not at her family’s solicitors but to
Mr Kendall who knew nothing about her save that he had prepared the 1976 lease.
Miss Pigott gave to Mr Kendall, according to his evidence, absurd reasons for the
grant of a new lease and no reason for the grant of a lease for 20 years on
disadvantageous terms.
Miss Pigott must have been under a total misapprehension of the facts when
she represented that she might be worried about the property and about the repair
of the property while she was away. Mr Kendall forcibly pointed out not only to Miss
Pigott but also to Mrs Boustany and her husband the disadvantages to Miss Pigott
of the new lease but Mrs Boustany and her husband gave no explanation and
offered no concessions. They were content to allow Miss Pigott ostensibly to insist
on the unjustifiable terms which they must have already persuaded her to accept.
When a writ was issued Mrs Boustany did not write to the solicitor but sought out
Miss Pigott and obtained a disclaimer which the court in due course rejected. The
inference which the trial judge drew, and which he was entitled to draw, was that
Mrs Boustany and her husband had prevailed upon Miss Pigott to agree to grant a
lease on terms which they knew they could not extract from Mr George Pigott or
anyone else. When they were summoned by Mr Kendall and the unfairness of the
lease was pointed out to them, they did not release Miss Pigott from the bargain
which they had unfairly pressed on her. In short Mrs Boustany must have taken
advantage of Miss Pigott before, during and after the interview with Mr Kendall and
with full knowledge before the 1980 lease was settled that her conduct was
unconscionable.
Commentary
This is a curious judgment. The five ‘submissions’ listed by Lord Templeman are
followed by a list of six factors from which unconscionable conduct was inferred. It is
difficult to disagree with Nicholas Bamforth (‘Unconscionability as a Vitiating Factor’
[1995] 
LMCLQ
 
538, 543–544) when he concludes:
Boustany
 
v. 
Pigott
 
is a prime example of the imprecise approach which must be avoided if unconscionability is
to merit support as a vitiating factor. … There are some basic problems with the Privy Council’s treatment of the
facts. We are not told 
why
 
Mrs Boustany could be said to have had full knowledge that her conduct was
unconscionable, or how any of the ‘submissions’ were brought into play. Miss Pigott had been incapable of
giving evidence at the original trial and Mrs Boustany declined to do so, explaining the need to make inferences.
This cannot, however, justify the failure to explain the inferences in the light of the five ‘submissions’. The Privy
Council simply presented a list of ‘submissions’ and a list of factual findings, without connecting the two. As in
other unconscionability cases, terms such as ‘affects his conscience’, ‘moral culpability’, ‘unconscientious’ and
‘unconscionable’ were used without explanation of their precise meaning …
The danger of using pejorative terms should be clear: precision and clarity are crucial when a court is
drawing up and deploying criteria for assessing whether a transaction is unconscionable, for the court must
strike a delicate balance between conflicting policy considerations. On the one hand, it is important to safeguard
the certainty of commercial transactions, especially those involving real property. It is also, however, important
to protect weaker parties against improper exploitation in the bargaining process. The situation is further
complicated by the need, in protecting weaker parties, to avoid compromising their autonomy through excessive
judicial intervention in their transactions. The chances of striking a coherent balance between those
considerations are greatly reduced when courts use imprecise or ambiguous language, or fail properly to explain
why transactions are upheld or struck down.
A further difficulty with 
Boustany
 
is that Miss Pigott did have independent advice.
Indeed, Lord Templeman points out that the disadvantages of the new lease were
‘forcibly pointed out to her’. Why did this independent advice not suffice to negate her
claim? It is not entirely clear. It may be that not enough was done to bring home to Miss
Pigott the nature of the transaction she was concluding.
20.3
 
The Role of Statutes
Parliament also has a role to play in regulating unfair terms in contracts. The most
significant examples are Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (see 
Chapter 14
) and
the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (
13.3
). A further example of legislative regulation of
unfair relationships is provided by sections 140A–140C of the Consumer Credit Act 1974
which provides protection for consumer debtors. Section 140A gives to the court the
power to make an order under section 140B,
if it determines that the relationship between the creditor and the debtor arising out of the agreement … is
unfair to the debtor because of one or more of the following: (a) any of the terms of the agreement or of any
related agreement; (b) the way in which the creditor has exercised or enforced any of his rights under the
agreement or any related agreement; or (c) any other thing done (or not done) by, or on behalf of the creditor.
This provision does not confer upon the courts a general jurisdiction to review
transactions concluded between commercial lenders and private borrowers in the name
of unfairness. 
Rather, the requirements of the section must be satisfied before the
jurisdiction of the court is triggered, albeit that the section is framed in broad terms. In
particular, the relationship between the debtor and the creditor must be unfair, the
focus of the court’s inquiry is upon hardship to the debtor (although matters relating to
the creditor may also be relevant to the court’s inquiry), and the alleged unfairness to
the debtor must have arisen from one of the factors listed in sub-paragraphs (a)–(c)
(
Plevin
 
v. 
Paragon Personal Finance Ltd
 
[2014] UKSC 61, [2014] 1 WLR 4222). Once
over the hurdles established by section 140A, section 140B confers broad powers on the
courts in order to remedy the unfairness in the relationship between these parties. Thus
they can (for example) order repayment of sums paid, reduce or discharge any sum
payable by the debtor, or alter the terms of the agreement.
While statutes provide individual examples of the regulation of unfair terms, it is
difficult to use statutes as building blocks in the construction of a general principle of
unconscionability or inequality of bargaining power. The reason for this is that statutes
and statutory instruments apply only to transactions that fall within their scope. They
cannot be applied by way of analogy to cases that fall outside their scope and the courts
have generally not been willing to rely on Acts of Parliament when developing the
common law (see

Morgan

A General Principle?
Thus far we have seen that English law has a collection of cases and statutes that seem to
reflect a concern for the fairness of the bargain that has been concluded by the parties.
But are they anything more than a collection of individual cases? Can they be
rationalized into a principle or set of principles of general application? Lord Denning
famously sought to create such a general principle in his judgment in 
Lloyds Bank Ltd
 
v.
Bundy
 
[1975] QB 326. He stated (at pp. 336–339):
Now let me say at once that in the vast majority of cases a customer who signs a bank guarantee or a charge
cannot get out of it. No bargain will be upset which is the result of the ordinary interplay of forces. There are
many hard cases which are caught by this rule. Take the case of a poor man who is homeless. He agrees to pay a
high rent to a landlord just to get a roof over his head. The common law will not interfere. It is left to
Parliament. Next take the case of a borrower in urgent need of money. He borrows it from the bank at high
interest and it is guaranteed by a friend. The guarantor gives his bond and gets nothing in return. The common
law will not interfere. Parliament has intervened to prevent moneylenders charging excessive interest. But it has
never interfered with banks.
Yet there are exceptions to this general rule. There are cases in our books in which the courts will set aside a
contract, or a transfer of property, when the parties have not met on equal terms—when the one is so strong in
bargaining power and the other so weak—that, as a matter of common fairness, it is not right that the strong
should be allowed to push the weak to the wall. Hitherto those exceptional cases have been treated each as a
separate category in itself. But I think the time has come when we should seek to find a principle to unite them.
I put on one side contracts or transactions which are voidable for fraud or misrepresentation or mistake. All
those are governed by settled principles. I go only to those where there has been inequality of bargaining power,
such as to merit the intervention of the court.
The categories
The first category is that of ‘duress of goods’ [on which see 
18.3
].
The second category is that of the ‘unconscionable transaction’. A man is so placed as to be in need of special
care and protection and yet his weakness is exploited by another far stronger than himself so as to get his
property at a gross undervalue. The typical case is that of the ‘expectant heir’ [see 
20.2
]. This second category is
said to extend to all cases where an unfair advantage has been gained by an unconscientious use of power by a
stronger party against a weaker.
The third category is that of ‘undue influence’ usually so called. These are divided into two classes as stated
by Cotton LJ in 
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
 
(1887) 36 Ch D 145, 171 [see 
19.3
].
The fourth category is that of ‘undue pressure’. The most apposite of that is 
Williams
 
v. 
Bayley
 
(1866) LR 1
HL 200 [see 
19.1
].
The fifth category is that of salvage agreements. When a vessel is in danger of sinking and seeks help, the
rescuer is in a strong bargaining position. The vessel in distress is in urgent need. The parties cannot be truly
said to be on equal terms [see 
20.2
].
The general principles
Gathering all together, I would suggest that through all these instances there runs a single thread. They rest on
‘inequality of bargaining power’. By virtue of it, the English law gives relief to one who, without independent
advice, enters into a contract upon terms which are very unfair or transfers property for a consideration which
is grossly inadequate, when his bargaining power is grievously impaired by reason of his own needs or desires,
or by his own ignorance or infirmity, coupled with undue influences or pressures brought to bear on him by or
for the benefit of the other. When I use the word ‘undue’ I do not mean to suggest that the principle depends on
proof of any wrongdoing. The one who stipulates for an unfair advantage may be moved solely by his own self-
interest, unconscious of the distress he is bringing to the other. I have also avoided any reference to the will of
the one being ‘dominated’ or ‘overcome’ by the other. One who is in extreme need may knowingly consent to a
most improvident bargain, solely to relieve the straits in which he finds himself. Again, I do not mean to suggest
that every transaction is saved by independent advice. But the absence of it may be fatal. With these
explanations, I hope this principle will be found to reconcile the cases.
Commentary
The choice of ‘inequality of bargaining power’ as the label was perhaps an unfortunate
one. It appeared to suggest that a mere imbalance in bargaining power would suffice to
give the court jurisdiction to intervene. But the sentence in Lord Denning’s judgment
immediately following the reference to ‘inequality of bargaining power’ makes clear that
what is required is both procedural and substantive unfairness. There must be a ‘grossly
inadequate’ consideration, a ‘grievous impairment’ of bargaining power, and ‘undue
influences or pressures’. This is hardly an easy test to satisfy. The creation of a general
principle found some supporters (see, for example, S Waddams, ‘Unconscionability in
Contracts’ (1976) 39 
MLR
 
369) who saw it as a means of unifying a range of disparate
cases and doctrines (for example, the penalty clause jurisdiction (
23.11
), the rules
relating to the incorporation and interpretation of exclusion clauses (
13.2
), the rules
relating to the incorporation of terms (
Chapter 9
), and the protection of weak and
vulnerable parties) and as a platform for the development of the law).
However, these hopes were dashed by the House of Lords in 
National Westminster
Bank plc
 
v. 
Morgan
 
[1985] AC 686, 707–708 when Lord Scarman stated:
Lord Denning MR [in 
Bundy
] believed that the doctrine of undue influence could be subsumed under a general
principle that English courts will grant relief where there has been ‘inequality of bargaining power’ (p. 339). He
deliberately avoided reference to the will of one party being dominated or overcome by another. The majority of
the court did not follow him; they based their decision on the orthodox view of the doctrine as expounded in
Allcard
 
v. 
Skinner
, 36 Ch D 145. The opinion of the Master of the Rolls, therefore, was not the ground of the
court’s decision, which was to be found in the view of the majority, for whom Sir Eric Sachs delivered the
leading judgment.
Nor has counsel for the respondent sought to rely on Lord Denning MR’s general principle; and, in my view,
he was right not to do so. The doctrine of undue influence has been sufficiently developed not to need the
support of a principle which by its formulation in the language of the law of contract is not appropriate to cover
transactions of gift where there is no bargain. The fact of an unequal bargain will, of course, be a relevant
feature in some cases of undue influence. But it can never become an appropriate basis of principle of an
equitable doctrine which is concerned with transactions ‘not to be reasonably accounted for on the ground of
friendship, relationship, charity, or other ordinary motives on which ordinary men act’ (Lindley LJ in 
Allcard
 
v.
Skinner
, at 185). And even in the field of contract I question whether there is any need in the modern law to
erect a general principle of relief against inequality of bargaining power. Parliament has undertaken the task—
and it is essentially a legislative task—of enacting such restrictions upon freedom of contract as are in its
judgment necessary to relieve against the mischief: for example, the hire-purchase and consumer protection
legislation, of which the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973, Consumer Credit Act 1974, Consumer
Safety Act 1978, Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 and Insurance Companies Act 1982 are examples. I
doubt whether the courts should assume the burden of formulating further restrictions.
Two points can be made in relation to the judgment of Lord Scarman. First, it depends
upon a particular perception of the relationship between the common law and statute
law. According to this view, once Parliament assumes the role of protecting the weak
and the vulnerable, the common law should return to its laissez-faire principles. But
there is another view. The alternative view is that the common law should build upon
the principles contained in these statutes: that is to say, the courts should see in these
statutes a commitment to fairness which should be reflected in the law outside the
immediate context of the statutes. The second point is that Lord Scarman gives priority
to Lord Denning’s choice of label over the substantive content of the principle he set out
in 
Bundy
. Greater concentration on the scope of the principle might have enabled it to
survive the scrutiny of the House of Lords. Notwithstanding these arguments, the
Supreme Court has recently affirmed the analysis of Lord Scarman in 
Pakistan
International Airline Corporation
 
v. 
Times Travel (UK) Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 40, [2021] 3
WLR 727, [26] in the following terms:
It is not in dispute that there is in English common law no doctrine of inequality of bargaining power in
contract, although such inequality may be a relevant feature in some cases of undue influence: 
National
Westminster Bank Plc
 
v. 
Morgan
 
[1985] AC 686, 708 per Lord Scarman. As Lord Scarman observed in 
The
Universe Sentinel
 
(p 401), when he referred to 
the judgment of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Simon in 
Barton
 
v.
Armstrong
, in commercial life many acts are done under pressure and sometimes overwhelming pressure. In
negotiating a commercial contract each party to the negotiations seeks to obtain contractual entitlements which
he or she does not possess unless and until the parties agree the terms of the contract. Inequality of bargaining
power means that one party in the negotiation of a commercial contract may be able to impose terms on a
weaker party which a party of equal bargaining power would refuse to countenance. Equally, a party in a strong
bargaining position, such as a monopoly supplier, may refuse outright to enter into a contract which the weaker
party desires or may impose terms which the weaker party considers to be harsh. The courts have taken the
position that it is for Parliament and not the judiciary to regulate inequality of bargaining power where a person
is trading in a manner which is not otherwise contrary to law.
20.5
 
The Search for Coherence
If it is the case that a general principle of inequality of bargaining power or
unconscionability is not acceptable to the courts, is it possible to identify the range of
factors taken into account by the courts in the cases with a view to providing a
structured framework within which the courts can decide whether or not to set aside a
particular contract? Attempts have been made to identify these factors and, in so doing,
to bring about a greater degree of coherence and predictability in the law. Two examples
are set out. The first, provided by Nicholas Bamforth, identifies ‘unconscientious receipt’
as the basis for intervention and further identifies four factors that are generally taken
into account by the courts. Secondly, David Capper identifies three such factors,
although it is important to note that his list is part of a wider project, namely to merge
the doctrines of undue influence and unconscionability into one doctrine by subsuming
undue influence under his wider notion of unconscionability. At the end of the extract
Capper raises the question of the role of substantive unfairness in the law of contract.
He suggests that it performs an evidentiary function; that is to say it provides evidence
from which other grounds of invalidity can be deduced. The last extract takes up the
difficult question of the role of substantive unfairness in the law of contract. Professor
Stephen A Smith argues for a more extensive role for substantive unfairness than that
recognized by Capper. While he dismisses a number of reasons that are commonly put
forward in support of the proposition that substantively unfair contracts are ‘bad’, he
does identify one argument which, in his view, supports the proposition that such
contracts are bad. That argument is that substantively unfair contracts make it more
difficult for us to lead autonomous lives, in the sense that they make it more difficult for
us to plan and direct our lives.
N BAMFORTH, ‘UNCONSCIONABILITY AS A VITIATING
FACTOR’
[1995] LMCLQ 538, 555–557
Courts are not, in reality, acting in a wholly discretionary fashion in cases where
unconscionability is invoked as a vitiating factor. Behind the imprecise language,
four elements have characteristically been treated as important in assessing
whether a transaction should be set aside: first, whether the weaker party was
afflicted by a special or serious 
disadvantage or disability, mere inequality of
bargaining power being insufficient; secondly, whether the stronger party’s conduct
amounted to actual or constructive fraud; thirdly, whether the weaker party lacked
independent advice; fourthly, whether the terms of the transaction were clearly
disadvantageous to the weaker party.
However, the precise weight attached to each of the four elements seems to
vary. There are many views about the importance of the terms of the transaction by
comparison with the other three elements, and it has even been suggested that
disadvantageous terms might not always be necessary. On balance, the
unconscionability cases seem to conform with Professor Atiyah’s suggestion that,
in judicial assessments of the propriety of transactions, ‘ideas of procedural and
substantive fairness feed upon each other’. The fraud element is also problematic.
‘Dishonesty’—the actual fraud requirement—tends towards imprecision, and
reliance on constructive fraud would take the unconscionability vitiating factor
dangerously close to being the sort of general power, decried by Toohey J, to set
aside bargains just because they appear at first glance to be unfair or harsh. Given
the vagueness of this element, it is unsurprising that there have been differences
of judicial opinion about whether the stronger party’s knowledge of the other’s
weakness should be subjectively held or objectively assessed.
This brings us to two interconnected issues. The first—a policy issue—is
whether unconscionability deserves support as a distinct vitiating factor. The
second—an issue of legal principle—is to identify unconscionability’s juristic basis,
that is, to establish the general principle which underpins it and locates it at a
particular point within the law. These two issues are interconnected because failure
to identify an underpinning principle is likely to magnify any appearance of
imprecision in unconscionability cases, disturbing those who believe that law
should, as a matter of policy, embody a degree of certainty. A suitable underpinning
principle would, by contrast, provide a way of understanding, rationalising and
controlling the development of the vitiating factor’s four elements, minimising the
danger of palm tree justice. The identification of a suitable underpinning principle
therefore affects the assessment of unconscionability’s desirability, in policy terms,
as a vitiating factor. The relative importance attached to the three policy factors …
—certainty in commercial transactions, protection of weaker parties from improper
exploitation, and avoiding judicial intervention on a scale which deprives vulnerable
persons of any bargaining autonomy—is also likely to influence the categorisation
of a particular underpinning principle as suitable.
It is likely that for most lawyers the desirable policy balance will be something
of a compromise—enough certainty to enable forward planning and security of
receipt in transactions, but sufficient flexibility to leave room for a residual
unconscionability jurisdiction according to which utterly exploitative transactions
can be struck down. A variety of possible underpinning principles might fit within
this balance. ‘Inequality of bargaining power’ has been dismissed as an
underpinning principle in the case law—rightly, as it cannot explain the need for
special disadvantage and the relevance of the terms of the transaction. It is also, in
and of itself, too vague a principle on which to base an entire vitiating factor.
Another possibility has been canvassed by John Cartwright, who argues that ‘[t]  he
key is that one party has abused his or her [bargaining] position vis-à-vis the
other’. Unfortunately, the term ‘abuse’ does not assist us greatly, being as
pejorative as much of the language used by the judiciary. This impression is
confirmed by Cartwright’s suggestion that misrepresentation, duress and undue
influence might also be described as examples of ‘abuse of bargaining position’,
implying that ‘abuse’ is a malleable concept which can simply be adjusted to fit the
vitiating factor in play. A similar argument can be made against the suggestion that
the basis of unconscionability is the effecting of relief in equity from fraud. Fraud is
as vague a concept when deployed as an 
underpinning principle as it is when
treated as an element which needs to be established in an unconscionability claim;
and, like ‘abuse of bargaining position’, it appears to be capable of manipulation to
fit whatever vitiating factor or rule it is said to underpin.
The most appropriate possibility, within the policy balance envisaged, is the
suggestion that unconscionability works to reverse or prevent unjust enrichment …
unconscionability as a vitiating factor falls within the family of ‘unjust factors’
labelled ‘unconscientious receipt’, where ‘the question for restitution is that the
defendant behaved badly in receiving the value in question’.
If restitution for unconscientious receipt is the principle which underpins
unconscionability as a vitiating factor, it is necessary to identify the type of
behaviour which should be regarded as ‘bad’. Otherwise, unconscionability will be
indistinguishable from other forms of ‘unconscientious receipt’. It is here that the
four common elements in unconscionability cases come into play. For the purpose
of ‘unconscientious receipt’ behaviour will be deemed to be ‘bad’, in the sense
which justifies the intervention of unconscionability as a vitiating factor, where the
stronger party exploits, in a dishonest fashion, the special disadvantage of the
weaker party in concluding with them a bargain which is to their severe
disadvantage, where the weaker party lacks adequate independent advice. This
formulation, marrying the underpinning principle with the elements of
unconscionability, is general enough to allow the vitiating factor to adapt itself to
new fact-situations, but sufficiently specific that it will be kept under tight control. As
‘receipt’ rests on a defendant-sided approach, it follows that the unconscionability
vitiating factor should be confined to cases where there has been deliberate
wrongdoing by the stronger party—in other words, where they have subjectively
exploited the other’s weakness rather than fallen below an objectively-assessed
standard of conduct.
D CAPPER, 
‘UNDUE INFLUENCE AND
UNCONSCIONABILITY: A RATIONALISATION’
(1998) 114 LQR 479, 499–500
A New Doctrine of Unconscionability
How would this new doctrine work? In essence, the court would have to weigh up
the three elements of relational inequality, transactional imbalance, and
unconscionable conduct, and come to an overall judgment as to whether a
particular transaction can stand. This would not, however, be a purely
impressionistic exercise. Transactional imbalance would serve an evidentiary
function … The principal grounds for relief would thus be relational inequality and
unconscionable conduct. The more there was of one of these features, the less
would be required of the other; and where one was not strongly in evidence
transactional imbalance would be needed to bolster it. Where the parties to a
transaction are on very unequal terms and the transaction is weighted strongly in
favour of one party, unconscionable conduct can be inferred. Where the parties are
on fairly equal terms and the defendant has clearly behaved unconscionably, the
court could infer that the defendant’s conduct has induced an unfair transaction if
the transaction appears unbalanced. …
The new doctrine would be neither specifically plaintiff-sided nor specifically
defendant-sided. The stronger the plaintiff-sided factor the weaker the defendant-
sided factor needs to be and vice versa, although a degree of unconscionable
conduct would be present in all 
cases since the passive receipt of benefits flowing
under a seriously unbalanced transaction where the plaintiff was clearly in an
unequal relationship with the defendant would count as unconscionable conduct.
In theory a transaction could be unconscionable where the defendant has behaved
abominably and extracted benefits from a plaintiff on equal terms with himself,
although it is probably unlikely that there would be many cases like this. The new
doctrine would also be more concerned with procedural than with substantive
unfairness. The importance of substantive unfairness as a vitiating factor in
contract is acknowledged, but this tends to provide evidence from which grounds
of invalidity can be deduced rather than serve as a vitiating factor of itself.
Substantive unfairness is not likely to become an independent ground of invalidity
so long as courts maintain the approach that they cannot make or remake a
contract for the parties. If a contract is substantively unfair, the obvious solution
would be to alter it to make it fair, but with some very limited exceptions, English
law does not do this.
Capper returned to his theme in a later article (‘The Unconscionable Bargain in the
Common Law World’ (2010) 126 
LQR
 
403) where he noted a difference between the
scope of the unconscionable bargain doctrine as it has evolved in England and the
doctrine as it has developed in other parts of the Commonwealth. He set out the
difference in the following terms (at p. 416):
The unconscionable bargain doctrine in England and Wales is starkly different from doctrines of substantially
similar juridical bases that are applied by the courts of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The
difference is most apparent in the insistence by English courts that harsh terms must be imposed on the weaker
party by the stronger party in a morally reprehensible manner. English law is not receptive to the view that a
contract can be unconscionable because the terms are very much to the advantage of the stronger party and the
latter passively received those advantages in the knowledge that the other party was vulnerable. Courts in other
parts of the common law world are much more alive to this problem and not at all hesitant about granting relief.
Capper prefers the broader Commonwealth version of the doctrine, in part because the
narrow English version requires an unhelpful extension to the doctrine of undue
influence in order to catch cases which would otherwise fall outside the definition of an
unconscionable bargain (an example which he cites in this respect is the decision of the
Court of Appeal in 
Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV
 
v. 
Burch
 
[1997] 1 All ER 144).
Instead, Capper advocates a merger of, or at least an accommodation between, undue
influence and unconscionable bargain. He concludes (at p. 419):
A merged doctrine of undue influence/unconscionable bargain would not, it is submitted, generate further
uncertainty than exists already in the common law. On the contrary, by allowing the courts to make a fresh start
with conceptually clear principles, a much more functional doctrine could be created by judicial decisions which
begin from the same sensible 
premises. The certainty so beloved of commercial lawyers would never be found
but this is one area of contract law where justice has a larger role to play and where the parties cannot resolve
all issues in advance by well drafted contractual terms. The uncertainty would be as to the outcome of cases
when the relevant principles were applied, and that is much better than the same kind of uncertainty coupled
with conceptual confusion as to what is truly objectionable about transactions under review. The current
approach of English law, which formally recognises the existence of the unconscionable bargain but never
seems to allow relief on this ground, risks incoherence by extending undue influence into cases … where it does
not belong … if the courts cannot find any clear theoretical basis for distinguishing undue influence and the
unconscionable bargain, the best way forward of all is surely to merge the smaller (undue influence) into the
larger (unconscionable bargain).
SA SMITH, 
‘IN DEFENCE OF SUBSTANTIVE
UNFAIRNESS’
(1996) 112 LQR 138, 145–154
The advocate of substantive unfairness must … explain why substantively unfair
contracts are bad. The enforcement of contracts is presumably a good thing
generally, so some reason for non-enforcement must be provided. But the reason
need not be along the lines that one of the parties coerced, defrauded, or
manipulated the other party (though these are good reasons). All that needs to be
shown, broadly speaking, is that a substantively unfair contract is not the sort of
contract the law should promote. This is an easier standard to meet than the
wrongfulness standard used in duress, fraud and so on. The difference is the same
as the difference between deciding what sorts of activities the state should prohibit,
or at least deter, and deciding what sorts of activities the state should subsidise.
We may be uncertain, for example, whether prostitution should be prohibited, yet
be reasonably confident that brothels should not be subsidised. Contract law—
which is funded from tax revenue—subsidises certain sorts of activities.
Why, then, might a contract’s price affect our valuation of the contract? Five
possibilities present themselves.
Evidentiary value
The first suggestion is that prices are of evidentiary importance. Unfair prices—
understood here as abnormal prices—are not always accompanied by an
invalidating procedural defect, but in some circumstances they are good evidence
of such a defect. If there is a high risk of duress, undue influence, or fraud and the
resulting contract is at an abnormal price, then even without direct proof of
wrongdoing a court might reasonably conclude that wrongdoing has occurred. …
Evidentiary arguments … are of limited interest. Evidentiary arguments do not
provide a reason for caring about the price per se. At most, they merely show that
in a few situations the price of a contract is evidence of something else that is
valuable …
Distributive justice
The most common, non-evidentiary, suggestion for why substantively unfair
contracts should not be enforced is that they upset distributive justice. At first
blush, this seems an unusual suggestion. Distributive justice is traditionally
understood as requiring that common goods be 
distributed fairly amongst the
members of a group or society. Contract law, which deals with two party
interactions, appears unconcerned with the distribution of common goods.
Contract law might, however, be instrumentally important in helping to preserve
a just distribution of such goods. In particular, a requirement of substantive fairness
might be important in maintaining a just distribution of purchasing power. If goods
are traded at fair prices—understood again as normal prices—the trading parties
end up with goods of roughly equivalent value to offer in the market. If they wish,
the parties can, at least in theory, return to their original pre-contract position
(minus transaction costs). Their purchasing power, as determined by the normal
prices of all the goods that the parties own, is unchanged. Substantively unfair
contracts upset the prior pattern of purchasing power and thus, it might be argued,
conflict with distributive justice.
This suggestion is largely immune to the objection that contracting parties will
bargain around redistribution rules, leaving unchanged or worsened the prior
distributional pattern. Substantive fairness, on a distributive justice interpretation,
does not require or support redistributions of purchasing power. It calls instead for
preventing redistributions. This feature of the distributive justice argument,
however, is also its main weakness (leaving aside the controversial issues of the
value of distributive justice generally and the extent, if any, that purchasing power
is a ‘common good’). The distributive justice argument calls for upholding existing
entitlements and therefore it applies straightforwardly only in societies—unlike any
we know of—which are already distributively just. Preserving an unjust distribution
of resources does not promote distributive justice. Indeed, if resources are unjustly
distributed, what are needed from the perspective of distributive justice are
substantively unfair terms … concerns of distributive justice provide at most a very
weak justification for the party-based concerns of substantive fairness.
Facilitating contracting
A third possible reason for caring about contract prices is that contract pricing can
affect individuals’ ability to contract. If, as seems plausible, courts should facilitate
contracting, this is a legitimate concern. There are at least four ways that contract
pricing might inhibit contracting. First, in monopolistic (and monopsonistic) markets
non-competitive pricing causes potential contractors to be priced out of the market.
Monopolistic pricing typically results in fewer contracts, but at a higher price. For
whatever reason contracts are valuable, this is undesirable. Second, the pricing
strategy of situational monopolists can make contracting more difficult. … Third,
and more generally, non-competitive pricing will, even in a competitive market,
reduce contracting overall. … Finally, in situations where one of the contracting
parties is unsure of the normal price for a good, a requirement that goods be sold
at normal prices can facilitate contracting … [I]t seems clear that the reasons these
suggestions provide for caring about contract prices are not reasons based on a
concern for substantive fairness. The fairness of the impugned contracts is in each
case beside the point. Indeed, there is nothing actually wrong with the contracts
themselves in the above examples: what is ‘wrong’ is that other contracts did not or
will not happen. … In short, whatever the merits of assessing contract prices in
order to facilitate contracting, such regulation is not justified by a concern for
substantive fairness.
Autonomy and basic needs
One reason for not enforcing a contract is that it does not support a valuable or
worthwhile activity. The rules regarding so-called immoral or illegal contracts, such
as contracts to sell babies and contracts of self-enslavement, are most naturally
defended (insofar as they can 
be defended) on this basis. The problem with
substantively unfair contracts is different. A substantively unfair contract may
support a perfectly worthwhile endeavour. Yet there is a connection between
substantive fairness and ‘non-valuable’ contracts. The underlying justification for
not enforcing non-valuable contracts is that the state should only lend a hand to
endeavours that help individuals to achieve well-being and thus to realize fulfilling
lives. Worthless activities, even if freely chosen, do not contribute to well-being.
Contract prices can affect contracting parties’ abilities to achieve fulfilling lives.
One explanation of how this can happen draws on the importance, for well-being,
of leading an autonomous, self-directed, life, and, more specifically, on the
importance of having a threshold level of material wealth. It is not necessary to be
rich to lead an autonomous life, but it is necessary to have one’s basic physical
needs met. Individuals whose every choice is dictated by the need to survive
cannot lead autonomous lives. They are unable to direct their lives in any
meaningful sense. A contract at abnormal prices can leave a contracting party in
this position. If the magnitude of the deviation is severe enough, the wealth of the
losing party may be reduced to less than the threshold level.
The problem with contracts that leave contracting parties in poverty is
significant and helps to explain why some contracts at abnormal prices appear so
repugnant. But, again, it is not a problem of substantive unfairness. Contracts
which leave a party in poverty are like contracts of self-enslavement. They are bad,
but they are not unfair (or at least only coincidentally unfair). Fairness is a relative
concept: if someone has been treated unfairly, someone else has been treated
differently. Yet in explaining why a contract that leaves someone in poverty is bad
the situation of the other party to the contract is irrelevant. All we need to know is
that one party has been left destitute. The same is true of contracts of self-
enslavement: all we need to know to condemn such contracts is that someone has
been made a slave. Thus, while some unfair contracts may be objectionable
because they leave one of the parties in a state of poverty, the substantive
unfairness of such contract is not the reason for the objection.
Autonomy and planning
The final reason for caring about contract prices is also founded on the
importance, for achieving well-being, of living an autonomous life. More
specifically, it is founded on the importance of being able to plan and control one’s
life. It is here, I suggest, that the key to understanding the value and meaning of
substantive fairness is found. The problem with substantively unfair contracts is
that they make it more difficult to direct our lives.
An autonomous life, in the sense I use this phrase, requires more than freedom
from coercion. Autonomy is fundamentally a matter of being able to direct one’s
life: we lead autonomous lives, broadly speaking, when we direct our lives to a
significant degree. Autonomous individuals need not live their lives according to
rigid patterns, but they must have a reasonable ability to shape and plan their lives.
Contract law helps us to lead autonomous lives by helping us to achieve valuable
goals and, as importantly, by helping us do this autonomously. It increases our
options and lets us decide what goals to pursue. The enforcement of contracts at
abnormal prices, however, can make it more difficult to lead an autonomous life.
Contracts at abnormal prices upset the material foundations upon which plans and
aspirations are built. Rich or poor, we plan and shape our lives upon assumptions
and expectations about our purchasing power. Contracts at abnormal prices upset
plans and, more generally, individuals’ abilities to control and direct their lives. … A
contract at an abnormal price is similar to an unannounced change in tax policy. It
shifts the purchasing power, leaving the losing party worse-off than before the
contract, and thereby making it more difficult for that party to achieve an
autonomous, that is, self-directed, life. This is true regardless of the justice of the
prior distribution of resources. Of course it is not possible or desirable to 
protect
individuals from all uncertainty. But avoidable, undesired, uncertainty should not be
promoted by the law.
The ‘planning’ justification supports a normal price standard for assessing
contracts. Plans are built upon normal prices. To be sure, courts could ensure that
plans were never upset by imposing fixed prices for all goods. This solution is
undesirable because contracting parties are normally better able than courts to set
prices at mutually attractive levels. Setting fixed prices would make contracting far
less appealing, thus limiting the good that contracting can achieve.
The importance of planning and the relation between shifts in purchasing power
and planning explain why courts should be concerned about contracts at abnormal
prices. But these considerations do not apply equally to all contracts at abnormal
prices. First, not all abnormal price contracts upset planning. In particular,
contracts where either (1) the losing party was making a gift, (2) the losing party
did not care about the price, or (3) the losing party was mistaken as to the nature
and hence value of the good he or she was selling (for example, not realising that
the painting offered was a Rembrandt) do not upset the losing party’s ability to
plan. In the first and third situation the losing party’s expectations were not upset
and in the second case the losing party had no expectations. Such contracts
should therefore be enforced.
A further, more general factor, in considering to what extent planning is upset
by abnormal price contracts is that if the deviation from normal price is small, either
in absolute terms or relative to the contract’s price, then harm to planning, though
not non-existent, is relatively trivial. … A second reason for limiting judicial scrutiny
of abnormal price contracts is that invalidating contracts itself produces uncertainty
and disrupts planning. … Taken together the results of our inquiries into (1) the
harm caused by abnormal price contracts and (2) the ease of avoiding this harm
suggest, therefore, the following general rule. Contracts in which the price deviates
significantly, both in absolute and relative terms, from the normal price and in
which the worse-off party cared about price, was not making a gift, was not
mistaken about the value of the good he or she was selling and was not in a better
position than the gaining party to obtain the normal price should not be enforced.

Frustration and Force Majeure
Central Issues
The doctrine of frustration operates to discharge a contract where,
after the formation of the contract, something occurs which renders
performance of the contract impossible, illegal, or something radically
different from that which was in the contemplation of the parties at the
time of entry into the contract.
While the doctrine of frustration is the subject of considerable analysis
in textbooks, its practical significance is limited. This is so for a
number of reasons. First, the doctrine does not apply where express
provision has been made in the contract for the event that is alleged to
have frustrated the contract. Given that force majeure and hardship
clauses seek to regulate events which may impede or hinder
performance of the contract, the impact of such events is more likely
to be regulated by the terms of the force majeure clause or the
hardship clause than by the doctrine of frustration. Secondly, the
doctrine does not apply where the event alleged to have frustrated the
contract was foreseeable. Thirdly, a contracting party cannot invoke
the doctrine of frustration where the alleged frustrating event was
caused by his own conduct rather than a supervening event. Fourthly,
the consequences of the application of the doctrine are drastic in that
it brings the contract automatically to an end, irrespective of the
wishes of the parties. The Draconian consequences of the application
of the doctrine inhibit its wider use. Finally, the courts have adopted a
restrictive approach to the operation of the doctrine in order to avoid it
becoming an escape route for a party who has entered into a bad
bargain. As Lord Roskill once put it, the doctrine of frustration is ‘not
lightly to be invoked to relieve contracting parties of the normal
consequences of imprudent bargains’ (
The Nema
 
[1982] AC 724, 752).
3.
This chapter has two principal aims. First, it seeks to ascertain the
scope of the doctrine of frustration and to examine the relationship
between the doctrine of frustration and any force majeure or hardship
clause that is to be found in the contract. Secondly, it explores, albeit
briefly, the reasons for the narrow scope of the doctrine of frustration
and contrasts it 
with the more liberal regimes to be found in, for
example, the Principles of European Contract Law. Should English law
follow the model found in the Principles and confer broader powers on
the courts, not only in relation to the circumstances in which they can
intervene but also in terms of their remedial powers when they do
intervene?

Introduction
In 
J Lauritzen AS
 
v. 
Wijsmuller BV
 
(
The
 
‘
Super Servant Two
’) [1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1
(
21.4
), Bingham LJ stated (at p. 8) that the doctrine of frustration has evolved to
‘mitigate the rigour of the common law’s insistence on literal performance of absolute
promises’ and that its object is ‘to give effect to the demands of justice, to achieve a just
and reasonable result, to do what is reasonable and fair, as an expedient to escape from
injustice where such would result from enforcement of a contract in its literal terms
after a significant change in circumstances’. There are three elements to this statement.
The first is the narrow approach initially taken by the common law. Liability for breach
of contract is generally strict; that is to say liability is not dependent upon proof of fault
by the party alleged to be in breach. This being the case, a party who fails to perform his
contractual obligations, for whatever reason, is prima facie in breach of contract. The
common law was generally reluctant to absolve a contracting party from the
consequences of his failure to perform his contractual obligations. The second point is
that the effect of the doctrine of frustration is to provide such an absolving power in that
it brings the contract to an end without imposing a liability in damages on the party who
has failed to perform his contractual obligations as a result of the supervening event.
The third point is that the doctrine only applies where there has been ‘a significant
change in circumstances’ after the making of the contract such that it would not be ‘fair’
to enforce the contract according to its original terms. As we shall see, the definition of a
‘significant change in circumstances’ has proved to be a difficult matter, but the essential
point to grasp at this stage is that the doctrine of frustration operates to discharge a
contract where, after the formation of the contract, something occurs which renders
performance of the contract impossible, illegal, or something radically different from
that which was in the contemplation of the parties at the time of entry into the contract.
The reference made by Bingham LJ to the ‘common law’s insistence on literal
performance of absolute promises’ is an important one. The original common law rule
was a very strict one. As Professor Simpson has pointed out (‘Innovation in Nineteenth
Century Contract Law’ (1975) 91 
LQR
 
247, 270):
In pre-nineteenth-century law the general rule was that a change of circumstances after a promise was made did
not excuse the promisor from performance, even if it made performance impossible; this view came to be
known as the rule in 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
 
(1647) or the rule as to absolute contracts. 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
 
did not
however deal with Acts of God, but with an Act of the King’s enemies, and there remained some scope for the
development of a defence of supervening impossibility through Act of God and this was allowed where death,
the most dramatic Act of God, intervened.
In 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
 
(1647) Aleyn 26 a tenant of a farm was dispossessed for a period of
two years as a result of an act of the King’s enemies. He claimed that he was not liable to
pay the rent for the period for which he had been dispossessed. It was held that he was
liable: he had assumed an obligation to pay the rent and he was bound to make that
obligation good. But, as Professor Simpson points out, the law did not take such an
absolute approach in all cases. An example is provided by the case of the death of a party
to a contract of apprenticeship. The courts held that the effect of the death of either
party was to dissolve the contract without any liability being imposed for the
consequences of a failure to perform the contract in accordance with its terms. Thus,
while the common law approach was very strict, it would not be true to say that it was, in
all cases, absolute.
The law has moved on from the strict approach taken in 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
. The decisive
case is generally considered to be the decision in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
(1863) 3 B & S 826
(extracted later). Its more liberal approach was developed in cases such as 
Jackson
 
v.
Union Marine Insurance Co Ltd
 
(1874) LR 10 CP 125 and 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
 
[1903] 2 KB
740 (
21.5.3
). While it is true to say that the doctrine of frustration is more liberal than
the common law rule to be found in 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
, it is important to stress that the
doctrine continues to operate within very narrow limits. Twentieth-century cases such
as 
Davis Contractors Ltd
 
v. 
Fareham Urban District Council
 
[1956] AC 696 (later in
this section), 
National Carriers Ltd
 
v. 
Panalpina (Northern) Ltd
 
[1981] AC 675 (
21.7
),
and 
J Lauritzen AS
 
v. 
Wijsmuller BV (The
 
‘
Super Servant Two
’) [1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1
(
21.4
) evince a restrictive approach to the scope of the doctrine of frustration. While it is
broader than the original common law rule, it remains a very narrow doctrine.
An introduction to the scope and the basis of the doctrine of frustration can be gleaned
from an examination of two cases. The first is the decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench
in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
(1863) 3 B & S 826 and the second is the decision of the House of
Lords in 
Davis Contractors Ltd
 
v. 
Fareham Urban District Council
 
[1956] AC 696.
Taylor
 
has been chosen because it is regarded as the origin of the modern doctrine of
frustration, while 
Davis
 
has been selected because it sets out the test that is generally
applied by the modern courts when deciding whether or not a contract has been
frustrated.
TAYLOR V. CALDWELL
(1863) 3 B & S 826, Queen’s Bench
The facts are set out in the judgment of Blackburn J.
Blackburn J
[gave the judgment of the court]
In this case the plaintiffs and defendants had, on the 27th May, 1861, entered
into a contract by which the defendants agreed to let the plaintiffs have the use of
The Surrey Gardens and Music Hall on four days then to come, viz. the 17th June,
15th July, 5th August and 19th August, for the purpose of giving a series of four
grand concerts, and day and night fetes at the Gardens and Hall on those days
respectively; and the plaintiffs agreed to take the Gardens and Hall on those days,
and pay 100l. for each day.
The parties inaccurately call this a ‘letting’, and the money to be paid a ‘rent’ but
the whole agreement is such as to shew that the defendants were to retain the
possession of the Hall and 
Gardens so that there was to be no demise of them,
and that the contract was merely to give the plaintiffs the use of them on those
days. Nothing however, in our opinion, depends on this. The agreement then
proceeds to set out various stipulations between the parties as to what each was
to supply for these concerts and entertainments, and as to the manner in which
they should be carried on. The effect of the whole is to shew that the existence of
the Music Hall in the Surrey Gardens in a state fit for a concert was essential for
the fulfilment of the contract,—such entertainments as the parties contemplated in
their agreement could not be given without it.
After the making of the agreement, and before the first day on which a concert
was to be given, the Hall was destroyed by fire. This destruction, we must take it
on the evidence, was without the fault of either party, and was so complete that in
consequence the concerts could not be given as intended. And the question we
have to decide is whether, under these circumstances, the loss which the plaintiffs
have sustained is to fall upon the defendants. The parties when framing their
agreement, evidently had not present to their minds the possibility of such a
disaster, and have made no express stipulation with reference to it, so that the
answer to the question must depend upon the general rules of law applicable to
such a contract.
There seems no doubt that where there is a positive contract to do a thing, not
in itself unlawful, the contractor must perform it or pay damages for not doing it,
although in consequence of unforeseen accidents, the performance of his contract
has become unexpectedly burthensome or even impossible. … But this rule is only
applicable when the contract is positive and absolute, and not subject to any
condition either express or implied: and there are authorities which, as we think,
establish the principle that where, from the nature of the contract, it appears that
the parties must from the beginning have known that it could not be fulfilled unless
when the time for the fulfilment of the contract arrived some particular specified
thing continued to exist, so that, when entering into the contract, they must have
contemplated such continuing existence as the foundation of what was to be done;
there, in the absence of any express or implied warranty that the thing shall exist,
the contract is not to be construed as a positive contract, but as subject to an
implied condition that the parties shall be excused in case, before breach,
performance becomes impossible from the perishing of the thing without default of
the contractor.
There seems little doubt that this implication tends to further the great object of
making the legal construction such as to fulfil the intention of those who entered
into the contract. For in the course of affairs men in making such contracts in
general would, if it were brought to their minds, say that there should be such a
condition.
Accordingly, in the Civil law, such an exception is implied in every obligation of
the class which they call 
obligatio de certo corpore
. … The examples are of
contracts respecting a slave, which was the common illustration of a certain
subject used by the Roman lawyers, just as we are apt to take a horse; and no
doubt the propriety, one might almost say necessity, of the implied condition is
more obvious when the contract relates to a living animal, whether man or brute,
than when it relates to some inanimate thing (such as in the present case a
theatre) the existence of which is not so obviously precarious as that of the live
animal, but the principle is adopted in the Civil law as applicable to every obligation
of which the subject is a certain thing. The general subject is treated by Pothier,
who in his 
Traité des Obligations
, partie 3, 
chap. 6
, art. 3, § 668 states the result to
be that the debtor corporis certi is freed from his obligation when the thing has
perished, neither by his act, nor his neglect, and before he is in default, unless by
some stipulation he has taken on himself the risk of the particular misfortune which
has occurred.
Although the Civil law is not of itself authority in an English Court, it affords
great assistance in investigating the principles on which the law is grounded. And it
seems to us that the common law authorities establish that in such a contract the
same condition of the continued existence of the thing is implied by English law.
There is a class of contracts in which a person binds himself to do something
which requires to be performed by him in person; and such promises, e.g.
promises to marry, or promises to serve for a certain time, are never in practice
qualified by an express exception of the death of the party; and therefore in such
cases the contract is in terms broken if the promisor dies before fulfilment. Yet it
was very early determined that, if the performance is personal, the executors are
not liable … It seems that in those cases the only ground on which the parties or
their executors, can be excused from the consequences of the breach of the
contract is, that from the nature of the contract there is an implied condition of the
continued existence of the life of the contractor. … These are instances where the
implied condition is of the life of a human being, but there are others in which the
same implication is made as to the continued existence of a thing. For example,
where a contract of sale is made amounting to a bargain and sale, transferring
presently the property in specific chattels, which are to be delivered by the vendor
at a future day; there, if the chattels, without the fault of the vendor, perish in the
interval, the purchaser must pay the price and the vendor is excused from
performing his contract to deliver, which has thus become impossible. … The
principle seems to us to be that, in contracts in which the performance depends on
the continued existence of a given person or thing, a condition is implied that the
impossibility of performance arising from the perishing of the person or thing shall
excuse the performance. In none of these cases is the promise in words other than
positive, nor is there any express stipulation that the destruction of the person or
thing shall excuse the performance; but that excuse is by law implied, because
from the nature of the contract it is apparent that the parties contracted on the
basis of the continued existence of the particular person or chattel. In the present
case, looking at the whole contract, we find that the parties contracted on the basis
of the continued existence of the Music Hall at the time when the concerts were to
be given; that being essential to their performance. We think, therefore, that the
Music Hall having ceased to exist, without fault of either party, both parties are
excused, the plaintiffs from taking the gardens and paying the money, the
defendants from performing their promise to give the use of the Hall and Gardens
and other things. Consequently the rule must be absolute to enter the verdict for
the defendants. Rule absolute.
Commentary
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
is a case of enormous significance in the development of this area of
the law. As Professor Treitel has stated (
Frustration and Force Majeure
 
(3rd edn, Sweet
& Maxwell, 2014), para 2–022):
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
is generally regarded as a turning point in this branch of the law, as the case in which the law
moved away from the doctrine of absolute contracts to the modern doctrine of discharge by supervening events.
This change was brought about by the familiar judicial technique of deducing a general principle from a series
of particular examples. In 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
, Blackburn J relies on three … mitigations of the doctrine of
absolute contracts …: cases in which death or permanent incapacity prevent performance of a contract for
personal services, cases in which specific goods are sold and perish after the property in them has passed to the
buyer, and cases in which the subject-matter of a bailment was destroyed without any default on the part of the
bailee. From these examples, he deduces the general principle which applies where ‘from the nature of the
contract, it appears that the parties must … have known that it could not be fulfilled unless … some particular
specified thing continued to exist’.
Taylor
 
is another example of an English court drawing upon civilian influences in the
development of the common law. The process of learning from other systems is no
modern phenomenon.
The general principle to be found in 
Taylor
 
is narrowly drawn. There are a number of
elements to it. First the Music Hall was ‘essential’ to the performance of the contract;
secondly, the Music Hall ‘ceased to exist’; thirdly, its destruction was not attributable to
the fault of either party; finally, the consequence of the destruction of the Music Hall
was to ‘excuse’ both parties from their obligation to perform. In confining the principle
to cases in which the subject matter of the contract ceased to exist, Blackburn J was able
to avoid a direct conflict with 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
 
(where the subject matter of the contract
had not ceased to exist). But this ground of distinction was not to last. While cases in
which the subject matter of the contract has ceased to exist may be at the core of the
doctrine of frustration, the doctrine extends beyond such cases to cases in which,
although the subject matter of the contract still exists, it is either not available for use
during the period of the contract or its use in the changed circumstances would be
something radically different from that which was in the contemplation of the parties at
the time of entry into the contract (
Jackson
 
v. 
Union Marine Insurance Co Ltd
 
(1874)
LR 10 CP 125).
The claim brought by the plaintiffs in 
Taylor
 
was one to recover the expenses which they
had incurred in advertising and making preparations for the concerts. Were the facts of
Taylor
 
to recur today the plaintiffs might attempt to recover these expenses from the
defendants under the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 (see 
21.6
) but the
claim would probably fail on the ground that the plaintiffs would not be able to establish
that the defendants had obtained a ‘valuable benefit’ as a result of their work in
advertising the concerts.
Finally, it is important to note that the technique used by the court was the implication
of a condition into the contract in order to give effect to what was claimed to be the
intention of the parties. As Professor Ibbetson has commented (
A Historical
Introduction to the Law of Obligations
 
(Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 224), the
nineteenth-century judges developed ‘rules of law behind a façade of party intention’.
He continues:
Thus in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
it was held that no action would lie for the breach of an agreement to allow the
plaintiffs the use of the defendants’ music hall when the music hall burned to the ground before the contract fell
due to be performed. The analysis of Blackburn J is revealing. Purporting to follow Roman texts to the effect
that there would be no liability on a 
stipulatio
 
to transfer property if it were accidentally destroyed before the
due date of transfer, he held that no liability arose in English law either, on the grounds that there was an
implied condition that the property should continue to exist; where Roman law had applied a rule, English law
construed—or imposed—an intention.
While implication of a term was the original technique used by the court to justify the
setting aside of the contract, modern courts no longer rely on this technique, as the next
case demonstrates:
DAVIS CONTRACTORS LTD V. FAREHAM URBAN
DISTRICT COUNCIL
[1956] AC 696, House of Lords
Davis Contractors Ltd was a firm of building contractors. They submitted a tender
to Fareham Urban District Council in relation to a building scheme at Gudgeheath
Lane, Fareham. Attached to the tender was a letter dated 18 March 1946 which
stated that the tender was 
subject to adequate supplies of labour being available
as and when required. The tender was successful and Davis and Fareham entered
into a contract in July 1946 under which Davis was to build seventy-eight houses
for Fareham within eight months for £94,425. Without fault on the part of Davis or
Fareham, adequate supplies of labour were not available and the work took
twenty-two months to complete at a cost to Davis of £115,233. Fareham paid Davis
the contract price. Davis claimed that they were entitled to be paid more than the
contract price. They advanced their claim on two separate grounds. First, they
submitted that the contract was subject to the conditions set out in their letter of 18
March so that the contract price was subject to the overriding condition that there
would be an adequate supply of labour. Secondly, they submitted that the delay
attributable to the shortage of labour had frustrated the contract. The House of
Lords rejected both submissions. It held that the letter of 18 March had not been
incorporated into the contract made in July 1946 and that the delay had not been
sufficient to frustrate the contract. The extracts that follow do not deal with the
incorporation point: they only deal with the doctrine of frustration.
Lord Reid
Frustration has often been said to depend on adding a term to the contract by
implication. … I find great difficulty in accepting this as the correct approach
because it seems to me hard to account for certain decisions of this House in this
way. … I may be allowed to note an example of the artificiality of the theory of an
implied term given by Lord Sands in 
James Scott & Sons Ltd
 
v. 
Del Sel
 
1922 SC
592, 597:
‘A tiger has escaped from a travelling menagerie. The milkgirl fails to deliver the
milk. Possibly the milkman may be exonerated from any breach of contract; but,
even so, it would seem hardly reasonable to base that exoneration on the ground
that “tiger days excepted” must be held as if written into the milk contract.’
I think that there is much force in Lord Wright’s criticism in 
Denny, Mott &
Dickson Ltd
 
v. 
James B Fraser & Co Ltd
 
[1944] AC 265, 275:
‘The parties did not anticipate fully and completely, if at all, or provide for what
actually happened. It is not possible, to my mind, to say that, if they had thought of
it, they would have said: “Well, if that happens, all is over between us.” On the
contrary, they would almost certainly on the one side or the other have sought to
introduce reservations or qualifications or compensations.’
It appears to me that frustration depends, at least in most cases, not on adding
any implied term, but on the true construction of the terms which are in the contract
read in light of the nature of the contract and of the relevant surrounding
circumstances when the contract was made.
Lord Radcliffe
Before I refer to the facts I must say briefly what I understand to be the legal
principle of frustration. It is not always expressed in the same way, but I think that
the points which are relevant to the decision of this case are really beyond dispute.
The theory of frustration belongs to the law of contract and it is represented by a
rule which the courts will apply in certain limited circumstances for the purpose of
deciding that contractual obligations, ex facie binding, are no longer enforceable
against the parties. The description of the circumstances that justify the application
of the rule and, consequently, the decision whether in a particular case those
circumstances exist are, I think, necessarily questions of law.
It has often been pointed out that the descriptions vary from one case of high
authority to another. Even as long ago as 1918 Lord Sumner was able to offer an
anthology of different tests directed to the factor of delay alone, and delay, though
itself a frequent cause of the principle of frustration being invoked, is only one
instance of the kind of circumstance to which the law attends (see 
Bank Line Ltd
 
v.
Arthur Capel & Co
 
[1919] AC 435, pp. 457, 460). A full current anthology would
need to be longer yet. But the variety of description is not of any importance so
long as it is recognized that each is only a description and that all are intended to
express the same general idea. I do not think that there has been a better
expression of that general idea than the one offered by Lord Loreburn in 
FA
Tamplin Steamship Co Ltd
 
v. 
Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co Ltd
 
[1916] 2
AC 397, at pp. 403, 404. It is shorter to quote than to try to paraphrase it:
‘ … a court can and ought to examine the contract and the circumstances in which it was made, not of
course to vary, but only to explain it, in order to see whether or not from the nature of it the parties must
have made their bargain on the footing that a particular thing or state of things would continue to exist.
And if they must have done so, then a term to that effect will be implied, though it be not expressed in
the contract … no court has an absolving power, but it can infer from the nature of the contract and the
surrounding circumstances that a condition which is not expressed was a foundation on which the
parties contracted.’
So expressed, the principle of frustration, the origin of which seems to lie in the
development of commercial law, is seen to be a branch of a wider principle which
forms part of the English law of contract as a whole. But, in my opinion, full weight
ought to be given to the requirement that the parties ‘must have made’ their
bargain on the particular footing. Frustration is not to be lightly invoked as the
dissolvent of a contract.
Lord Loreburn ascribes the dissolution to an implied term of the contract that
was actually made. This approach is in line with the tendency of English courts to
refer all the consequences of a contract to the will of those who made it. But there
is something of a logical difficulty in seeing how the parties could even impliedly
have provided for something which ex hypothesi they neither expected nor
foresaw; and the ascription of frustration to an implied term of the contract has
been criticized as obscuring the true action of the court which consists in applying
an objective rule of the law of contract to the contractual obligations that the parties
have imposed upon themselves. So long as each theory produces the same result
as the other, as normally it does, it matters little which theory is avowed (see 
British
Movietonews Ltd
 
v. 
London and District Cinemas Ltd
 
[1952] AC 166, 184 per
Viscount Simon). But it may still be of some importance to recall that, if the matter
is to be approached by way of implied term, the solution of any particular case is
not to be found by inquiring what the parties themselves would have agreed on
had they been, as they were not, forewarned. It is not merely that no one can
answer that hypothetical question: it is also that the decision must be given
‘irrespective of the individuals concerned, their temperaments and failings, their
interest and circumstances’ (
Hirji Mulji
 
v. 
Cheong Yue Steamship Co Ltd
 
[1926] AC
497, 510). The legal effect of frustration ‘does not depend on their intention or their
opinions, or even knowledge, as to the event’ (ibid at p. 509). On the contrary, it
seems that when the event occurs
‘the meaning of the contract must be taken to be, not what the parties did intend (for they had neither
thought nor intention regarding it), but that which the parties, as fair and reasonable men, would
presumably have agreed upon if, having such possibility in view, they had made express provision as to
their several rights and liabilities in the event of its occurrence’ (
Dahl
 
v. 
Nelson
 
(1881) 6 App Cas 38 at p.
59, per Lord Watson).
By this time it might seem that the parties themselves have become so far
disembodied spirits that their actual persons should be allowed to rest in peace. In
their place there rises the figure of the fair and reasonable man. And the
spokesman of the fair and reasonable man, who represents after all no more than
the anthropomorphic conception of justice, is and must be the court itself. So
perhaps it would be simpler to say at the outset that frustration occurs whenever
the law recognizes that without default of either party a contractual obligation has
become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which
performance is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which
was undertaken by the contract. 
Non haec in foedera veni
. It was not this that I
promised to do.
There is, however, no uncertainty as to the materials upon which the court must
proceed. ‘The data for decision are, on the one hand, the terms and construction of
the contract, read in the light of the then existing circumstances, and on the other
hand the events which have occurred’ (
Denny, Mott & Dickson Ltd
 
v. 
James B
Fraser & Co Ltd
 
[1944] AC 265, 274, 275 per Lord Wright). In the nature of things
there is often no room for any elaborate inquiry. The court must act upon a general
impression of what its rule requires. It is for that reason that special importance is
necessarily attached to the occurrence of any unexpected event that, as it were,
changes the face of things. But, even so, it is not hardship or inconvenience or
material loss itself which calls the principle of frustration into play. There must be
as well such a change in the significance of the obligation that the thing
undertaken would, if performed, be a different thing from that contracted for.
I am bound to say that, if this is the law, the appellants’ case seems to me a
long way from a case of frustration. Here is a building contract entered into by a
housing authority and a big firm of contractors in all the uncertainties of the post-
war world. Work was begun shortly before the formal contract was executed and
continued, with impediments and minor stoppages but without actual interruption,
until the 78 houses contracted for had all been built. After the work had been in
progress for a time the appellants raised the claim, which they repeated more than
once, that they ought to be paid a larger sum for their work than the contract
allowed; but the respondents refused to admit the claim and, so far as appears, no
conclusive action was taken by either side which would make the conduct of one
or the other a determining element in the case.
That is not in any obvious sense a frustrated contract …
Two things seem to me to prevent the application of the principle of frustration
to this case. One is that the cause of the delay was not any new state of things
which the parties could not reasonably be thought to have foreseen. On the
contrary, the possibility of enough labour and materials not being available was
before their eyes and could have been the subject of special contractual
stipulation. It was not made so. The other thing is that, though timely completion
was no doubt important to both sides, it is not right to treat the possibility of delay
as having the same significance for each. The owner draws up his conditions in
detail, specifies the time within which he requires completion, protects himself both
by a penalty clause for time exceeded and by calling for the deposit of a guarantee
bond and offers a certain measure of security to a contractor by his escalator
clause with regard to wages and prices. In the light of these conditions the
contractor makes his tender, and the tender must necessarily take into account the
margin of profit that he hopes to obtain upon his adventure and in that any
appropriate allowance for the obvious risks of delay. To my mind, it is useless to
pretend that the contractor is not at risk if delay does occur, even serious delay.
And I think it a misuse of legal terms to call in frustration to get him out of his
unfortunate predicament.

Commentary
Davis
 
is a case of alleged commercial impracticability rather than impossibility. It was
clearly not impossible for Davis to carry out their contractual obligations. Indeed, they
did carry them out and had been paid the contract price for so doing. Their submission
was, in essence, that it was not fair to hold them to the contract price in these changed
circumstances. Some jurisdictions in the world, such as the United States, recognize the
existence of a doctrine of commercial impracticability. 
Davis
 
can be interpreted as a
case that is hostile to the existence of such a doctrine. But this may be to go too far. As
Professor Treitel points out (
Frustration and Force Majeure
 
(3rd edn, Sweet & Maxwell,
2014), para 6–025):
The case may be indicative of the English attitude towards ‘impracticability’ but the outcome does not reveal
any actual difference between the English and the American approaches; for in an almost contemporaneous
similar American case the court reached the same result and did so for similar reasons. Moreover, the
percentage by which costs had increased in the 
Davis Contractors
 
case was relatively low: it amounted to less
than 23 per cent. of the contract price and such an increase would not have come even close to bringing the
American doctrine of discharge by impracticability into play.
Secondly, it is worth noting that the contractors in 
Davis
 
did attempt to make provision
for the consequences of a possible shortage of labour but failed to ensure that the term
was incorporated into the contract. This demonstrates the importance not only of
drafting an appropriate clause to deal with the impact of events which may make
performance more onerous or difficult but also of ensuring that that term is
incorporated into the contract (see further 
9.1
). The fact that labour shortages had been
in the contemplation of the parties at the time of entry into the contract also made it
more difficult for the contractors to argue that a shortage of labour frustrated the
contract (on the significance of foreseeability, see 
21.3
).
Thirdly, it should be noted that this was a contract which had been performed according
to its terms in that the contractors had done the work and the employers had paid the
contract price. The reason for the reliance by the contractors on the doctrine of
frustration was that it was necessary for them to set aside the original contract if they
were to succeed in their aim of recovering a sum in excess of the contract price. But their
attempt failed. Here one can see how frustration can be invoked by a party who wishes
to escape from what has turned out to be a bad bargain. The House of Lords were,
however, alert to this danger and they refused to invoke the doctrine of frustration for
the purpose of enabling the contractors to escape from their original bargain.
Two final points should be noted about 
Davis
 
and they can be taken together. The first is
that the judgments demonstrate a reluctance to invoke the doctrine of frustration. Thus
Lord Radcliffe stated that it was not mere hardship which caused the doctrine to be
applicable and that frustration was not lightly to be invoked as the dissolvent of a
contract. The second point is that the House of Lords rejected the implied term theory of
frustration which had found favour with the court in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
(earlier in this
section). It was, in the view of both Lord Reid and Lord Radcliffe, unrealistic to impute
the existence of the doctrine to the intention of the parties. Instead, the emphasis was
placed upon the construction of the contract and whether ‘the thing undertaken would,
if performed, be a different thing from that contracted for’. This obviously requires the
court to carry out a comparative exercise. The court must first ascertain what it is that
the contract requires of the parties and then it must compare the performance in the
changed circumstances with that originally 
undertaken. It is only in the case where there
is a radical difference between the original contractual obligation and performance in
the changed circumstances that the doctrine of frustration comes into play.
While the test set out by Lord Radcliffe may be described as the ‘overall test’ which the
English courts apply when deciding whether or not a contract has been frustrated, it
should not be thought that there is any one factor which the courts regard as ‘critical’ in
every case. The approach which the court adopts has been described as ‘multi-factorial’
(
Edwinton Commercial Corporation, Global Tradeways Ltd
 
v. 
Tsavliris Russ
(Worldwide Salvage & Towage) Ltd (The ‘Sea Angel’)
 
[2007] EWCA Civ 547, [2007] 2
Lloyd’s Rep 517, [111]). According to this view, regard should be had to a range of factors
when deciding whether or not a contract has been frustrated. Rix LJ summarized this
approach in his judgment in 
The Sea Angel
 
in the following way (at [111]):
Among the factors which have to be considered are the terms of the contract itself, its matrix or context, the
parties’ knowledge, expectations, assumptions and contemplations, in particular as to risk, as at the time of
contract, at any rate so far as these can be ascribed mutually and objectively, and then the nature of the
supervening event, and the parties’ reasonable and objectively ascertainable calculations as to the possibilities
of future performance in the new circumstances. Since the subject matter of the doctrine of frustration is
contract, and contracts are about the allocation of risk, and since the allocation and assumption of risk is not
simply a matter of express or implied provision but may also depend on less easily defined matters such as ‘the
contemplation of the parties’, the application of the doctrine can often be a difficult one. In such circumstances,
the test of ‘radically different’ is important: it tells us that the doctrine is not to be lightly invoked; that mere
incidence of expense or delay or onerousness is not sufficient; and that there has to be as it were a break in
identity between the contract as provided for and contemplated and its performance in the new circumstances.
In 
Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines
 
v. 
Steamship Mutual Underwriting
Association (Bermuda) Ltd
 
[2010] EWHC 2661 (Comm), [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 195, [105]
Beatson J divided these factors into two groups. The first, consisting of the terms of the
contract, its matrix or context, and the parties’ knowledge, expectations, assumptions,
and contemplations, in particular as to risk, as at the time of entry into the contract so
far as these can be ascribed mutually and objectively, he labelled ‘
ex ante
 
factors’. The
others (the nature of the supervening event and the parties’ reasonable and objectively
ascertainable calculations as to the possibility of future performance in the new
circumstances) he stated were ‘post-contractual’.
One consequence of the narrow approach to the doctrine of frustration is that it has
become a doctrine of limited practical significance. This is so for a number of reasons.
First, it does not apply where express provision has been made in the contract for the
event that is alleged to have frustrated the contract (see 
21.2
). Given that force majeure
and hardship clauses seek to regulate events which may impede or hinder performance
of the contract, the impact of such events is more likely to be regulated by the terms of
the force majeure clause or the hardship clause than by the doctrine of frustration.
Secondly, the doctrine does not apply where the event alleged to have frustrated the
contract was foreseeable (
21.3
). Thirdly, a contracting party cannot invoke the doctrine
of frustration where the alleged frustrating event was caused by his own conduct rather
than a supervening event (
21.4
). Fourthly, the courts have adopted a restrictive
approach to the operation of the doctrine in order to avoid it becoming an escape route
for a party who has entered into a bad bargain (
21.5
). As Lord Roskill once put it, the
doctrine of frustration is ‘not lightly to be invoked to 
relieve contracting parties of the
normal consequences of imprudent bargains’ (
The Nema
 
[1982] AC 724, 752). Finally,
the consequences of the application of the doctrine are drastic in that it brings the
contract automatically to an end, irrespective of the wishes of the parties (
21.6
). The
Draconian consequences of the application of the doctrine inhibit its wider use.
21.2
 
Construction of the Contract
The starting point in any case in which it is alleged that the contract has been frustrated
must be the terms of the contract itself. This is so for two reasons. The first is that it is
necessary to ascertain the extent of the obligations undertaken in the contract in order
to decide whether performance in the changed circumstances is something radically
different from the obligation initially assumed. In other words, one must ascertain the
obligations that have been assumed by the contracting parties before deciding whether
or not the contract has been frustrated. The second reason is a rather different one and
that is to ascertain whether or not the contract makes provision for the events which
have occurred. If the contract does make provision for that event then it is the contract
that will regulate the impact that the event will have on the obligations contained in the
contract and not the doctrine of frustration. Many modern contracts are drafted in
elaborate terms and the likelihood that the contract will make provision for the events
which have occurred is rather high. This is particularly so where the contract contains a
force majeure clause (see 
12.3.5
) or a hardship clause (see 
12.3.9
). In 
J Lauritzen AS
 
v.
Wijsmuller BV (The ‘Super Servant Two’)
 
[1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1 (
21.4
) one of the events
listed in the force majeure clause was ‘the closure of the Suez or Panama Canal’.
Suppose that performance of the contract became more onerous for one party as a result
of the closure of the Suez Canal. Such an event could not frustrate the contract because
the contract itself has made provision for the closure of the Suez Canal and, this being
the case, it is the contract that regulates the consequences of the closure of the Suez
Canal and not the doctrine of frustration.
Yet it is unlikely that the presence of a force majeure clause will suffice of itself to
exclude any possibility of reliance upon the doctrine of frustration (although in 
Bremer
Handelsgesellschaft mbH
 
v. 
Vanden Avenne-Izegem PVBA
 
[1977] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 133,
163 Mocatta J thought that there was ‘much to be said’ for the submission that ‘there
was no room for the doctrine of frustration to apply’ as a result of the elaborate force
majeure clauses to be found in the contract). While a force majeure clause (or a hardship
clause) does not suffice of itself to shut out the doctrine of frustration, the clause may be
relied upon for the purpose of showing that the parties have made express provision for
the event that has occurred. And, where the parties have made such provision, the
contract cannot be frustrated (except in the case of subsequent illegality, 
21.5.2
, where
overriding considerations of public policy prevent effect being given to the terms of the
contract: see 
Ertel Bieber and Co
 
v. 
Rio Tinto Co Ltd
 
[1918] AC 260). Why does the
presence of a force majeure clause not have the automatic effect of excluding the
operation of the doctrine of frustration? The answer is that a force majeure clause is
primarily intended to cover events which are capable of resolution within a relatively
short time-frame and a court is therefore likely to conclude that it does not, as a matter
of construction, extend to catastrophic events which render further performance
obviously impossible.
An example is provided by 
Metropolitan Water Board
 
v. 
Dick Kerr and Co
 
[1918] AC
119. Contractors agreed in 1914 to construct a reservoir to be completed within six years.
In 1916 the contractors were required by Government Order to stop the work and sell
their plant. 
In these circumstances the contractors claimed that the contract had been
frustrated. The Water Board denied that the contract had been frustrated and, for this
purpose, placed reliance on condition 32 of the contract which, after setting out the
obligations of the contractors, continued:
Provided always that if by reason of any additional works or enlargements of the works (which additions or
enlargements the engineer is hereby authorised to make), or for any other just cause arising with the Board or
with the engineer, or in consequence of any unusual inclemency of the weather, or general or local strikes, or
combination of workmen, or for want or deficiency of any orders, drawings or directions, or by reason of any
difficulties, impediments, obstructions, oppositions, doubts, disputes, or differences, whatsoever and
howsoever occasioned, the contractor shall, in the opinion of the engineer (whose decision shall be final), have
been unduly delayed or impeded in the completion of this contract, it shall be lawful for the engineer, if he shall
so think fit, to grant from time to time, and at any time or times by writing under his hand, such extension of
time either prospectively or retrospectively, and to assign such other day or days for or as for completion, as to
him may seem reasonable, without thereby prejudicing or in any manner affecting the validity of the contract,
or the adequacy of the contract price, or the adequacy of the sums or prices mentioned in the third schedule;
and any and every such extension of time shall be deemed to be in full compensation and satisfaction for, and in
respect of, any and every actual or probable loss or injury sustained or sustainable by the contractor in the
premises, and shall in like manner exonerate him from any claim or demand on the part of the Board, for and in
respect of the delay occasioned by the cause or causes in respect of which any and every such extension of time
shall have been granted, but no further or otherwise, nor for or in respect of any delay continued beyond the
time mentioned in such writing or writings respectively.
The Water Board pointed out that this condition applied to delay ‘whatsoever and
howsoever occasioned’ and they submitted that the events which had occurred were
regulated by condition 32 and not by the doctrine of frustration. The House of Lords
rejected this submission and held that the contract had been frustrated. Lord Finlay LC
stated (at pp. 125–126):
It is admitted that the prosecution of the works became illegal in consequence of the action of the Minister of
Munitions. It became illegal on February 21, 1916, and remains illegal at the present time. This is not a case of a
short and temporary stoppage, but of a prohibition in consequence of war, which has already been in force for
the greater part of two years, and will, according to all appearances, last as long as the war itself, as it was the
result of the necessity of preventing the diversion to civil purposes of labour and material required for purposes
immediately connected with the war. Condition 32 provides for cases in which the contractor has, in the opinion
of the engineer, been unduly delayed or impeded in the completion of his contract by any of the causes therein
enumerated or by any other causes, so that an extension of time was reasonable. Condition 32 does not cover
the case in which the interruption is of such a character and duration that it vitally and fundamentally changes
the conditions of the contract, and could not possibly have been in the contemplation of the parties to the
contract when it was made.
Thus the magnitude of the event was such that it took it outside the scope of the clause,
notwithstanding the use of the words ‘whatsoever and howsoever occasioned’. On the
same reasoning, a force majeure clause which includes in the list of force majeure events
‘strikes’ and ‘wars’ may be held, as a matter of interpretation, not to cover a protracted
national strike, 
such as a general strike, or a war of the magnitude of the First or Second
World War (see 
Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna
 
v. 
Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd
[1943] AC 32, 40–41). Such catastrophic events are, however, comparatively rare. Most
of the events that occur will fall within the scope of an appropriately drafted force
majeure or hardship clause. As contracts make provision for the occurrence of a greater
range of events, so the scope for the application of the doctrine of frustration
diminishes. In most cases the inquiry will start and finish with the terms of the contract
itself.
21.3
 
Foreseeable Events
A further factor which limits the operation of the doctrine of frustration is the general
rule that an event which was foreseeable, and therefore within the contemplation of the
parties at the time of entry into the contract, does not operate to frustrate a contract. A
frustrating event is one that was not foreseen and was not foreseeable by the parties. The
difficulty with this formula is the obvious one, namely identifying what is and what is
not foreseeable at the moment of entry into the contract. Events such as wars and
earthquakes are foreseeable in the sense that we are all aware that they may take place.
But in some parts of the world they are more foreseeable than in others. Take
earthquakes as an example: some parts of the world are at greater risk of earthquakes
than others. How foreseeable does the event have to be before it prevents reliance being
placed upon the doctrine of frustration? This is a difficult question to answer because it
is a question of degree and the Court of Appeal has warned against the ‘over-refinement’
of the concept of foreseeability in this context (
The ‘Sea Angel’
 
[2007] EWCA Civ 547,
[2007] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 517, [127]). The most that can be said is that the less that an event
in its type and impact is foreseeable, the more likely it is to be a factor which, depending
on the facts and circumstances of the case, may lead to the frustration of a contract. A
rather more robust view was, however, taken by Lord Denning in the following case:
OCEAN TRAMP TANKERS CORPORATION V. V/O
SOVFRACHT, THE EUGENIA
[1964] 2 QB 226, Court of Appeal
On 8 September 1956 the defendants chartered the vessel the 
Eugenia
 
for a ‘trip
out to India via the Black Sea’. At the time at which they entered into the
agreement both parties were aware of the possibility that the Suez Canal might be
closed as a result of the build-up of military activity in the area. The parties were
unable to reach agreement on a clause to deal with the possibility of the Canal
being closed and so the contract was silent on the point. A war clause in the
contract prohibited the charterers from sailing into a zone which was ‘dangerous as
the result of any actual or threatened act of war’ etc. The vessel arrived at Port
Said at a time when Egyptian anti-aircraft guns were firing and the zone was a
‘dangerous’ one within the meaning of the war clause. Notwithstanding this, the
vessel proceeded to enter the Suez Canal on 31 October 1956 where she became
trapped and was not released until January 1957. On 4 January 1957 the
charterers claimed that the charterparty had been frustrated by the events which
had occurred. The owners denied that the contract had been frustrated and
brought a claim for damages for breach of contract against the charterers. Their
claim succeeded. It was held that the defendants were in breach of the war clause
in entering the Suez Canal and that the effect of the closure of the Suez Canal had
not been to frustrate the contract between the parties.
Lord Denning MR
The second question is whether the charterparty was frustrated by what took
place. The arbitrator has held it was not. The judge has held that it was. Which is
right? One thing that is obvious is that the charterers cannot rely on the fact that
the 
Eugenia
 
was trapped in the canal; for that was their own fault. They were in
breach of the war clause in entering it. They cannot rely on a self-induced
frustration, see 
Maritime National Fish Ltd
 
v. 
Ocean Trawlers Ltd
 
[1935] AC 524.
But they seek to rely on the fact that the canal itself was blocked. They assert that
even if the 
Eugenia
 
had never gone into the canal, but had stayed outside (in
which case she would not have been in breach of the war clause), nevertheless
she would still have had to go round by the Cape. And that, they say, brings about
a frustration, for it makes the venture fundamentally different from what they
contracted for. The judge has accepted this view. He has held that on November
16, 1956, the charterparty was frustrated …
This means that once again we have had to consider the authorities on this
vexed topic of frustration. But I think the position is now reasonably clear. It is
simply this: if it should happen, in the course of carrying out a contract, that a
fundamentally different situation arises for which the parties made no provision—
so much so that it would not be just in the new situation to hold them bound to its
terms—then the contract is at an end. It was originally said that the doctrine of
frustration was based on an implied term; in short, that the parties, if they had
foreseen the new situation, would have said to one another: ‘If that happens, of
course, it is all over between us’. But the theory of an implied term has now been
discarded by everyone, or nearly everyone, for the simple reason that it does not
represent the truth. The parties would not have said: ‘It is all over between us’.
They would have differed about what was to happen. Each would have sought to
insert reservations or qualifications of one kind or another. Take this very case. The
parties realised that the canal might become impassable. They tried to agree on a
clause to provide for the contingency. But they failed to agree. So there is no room
for an implied term.
It has frequently been said that the doctrine of frustration only applies when the
new situation is ‘unforeseen’ or ‘unexpected’ or ‘uncontemplated’, as if that were an
essential feature. But it is not so. The only thing that is essential is that the parties
should have made no provision for it in their contract. The only relevance of it
being ‘unforeseen’ is this: If the parties did not foresee anything of the kind
happening, you can readily infer they have made no provision for it: whereas, if
they did foresee it, you would expect them to make provision for it. But cases have
occurred where the parties have foreseen the danger ahead, and yet made no
provision for it in the contract. Such was the case in the Spanish Civil War when a
ship was let on charter to the republican government. The purpose was to
evacuate refugees. The parties foresaw that she might be seized by the
nationalists. But they made no provision for it in their contract. Yet, when she was
seized, the contract was frustrated, see 
WJ Tatem Ltd
 
v. 
Gamboa
 
[1939] 1 KB 132.
So here the parties foresaw that the canal might become impassable: it was the
very thing they feared. But they made no provision for it. So there is room for the
doctrine to apply if it be a proper case for it.
We are thus left with the simple test that a situation must arise which renders
performance of the contract ‘a thing radically different from that which was
undertaken by the contract’, see 
Davis Contractors Ltd
 
v. 
Fareham Urban District
Council
 
[1956] AC 696, 729 by Lord Radcliffe. To see if the doctrine applies, you
have first to construe the contract and see whether the parties have themselves
provided for the situation that has arisen. If they have provided for it, the contract
must govern. There is no frustration. If they have not provided for it, then you have
to compare the new situation with the situation for which they did provide. Then
you must see how different it is. The fact that it has become more onerous or more
expensive for one party than he thought is not sufficient to bring about a frustration.
It must be more than merely more onerous or more expensive. It must be
positively unjust to hold the parties bound. It is often difficult to draw the line. But it
must be done. And it is for the courts to do it as a matter of law: see 
Tsakiroglou &
Co Ltd
 
v. 
Noblee Thorl GmbH
 
[1962] AC 93, 116, 119 by Lord Simonds and by
Lord Reid.
Applying these principles to this case, I have come to the conclusion that the
blockage of the canal did not bring about a ‘fundamentally different situation’ such
as to frustrate the venture. My reasons are these: (1) The venture was the whole
trip from delivery at Genoa, out to the Black Sea, there load cargo, thence to India,
unload cargo, and redelivery. The time for this vessel from Odessa to Vizagapatam
via the Suez Canal would be 26 days, and via the Cape, 56 days. But that is not
the right comparison. You have to take the whole venture from delivery at Genoa to
redelivery at Madras. We were told that the time for the whole venture via the Suez
Canal would be 108 days and via the Cape 138 days. The difference over the
whole voyage is not so radical as to produce a frustration. (2) The cargo was iron
and steel goods which would not be adversely affected by the longer voyage, and
there was no special reason for early arrival. The vessel and crew were at all times
fit and sufficient to proceed via the Cape. (3) The cargo was loaded on board at the
time of the blockage of the canal. If the contract was frustrated, it would mean, I
suppose, that the ship could throw up the charter and unload the cargo wherever
she was, without any breach of contract. (4) The voyage round the Cape made no
great difference except that it took a good deal longer and was more expensive for
the charterers than a voyage through the canal.

Commentary
The difficulty with this decision lies in Lord Denning’s rejection of the proposition that
the doctrine of frustration applies only to events which are ‘unforeseen’, ‘unexpected’, or
‘uncontemplated’. In his view, the test to be applied is whether or not provision has been
made for the event which has occurred, and the foreseeability of the event is merely a
factor to be taken into account when deciding whether or not one would expect parties
to make provision for the event which has occurred. Professor Treitel (
Frustration and
Force Majeure
 
(3rd edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2014), para 13–014) has criticized this aspect
of Lord Denning’s judgment on the following ground:
[T]hese remarks are 
obiter
 
and it is respectfully submitted that this aspect of the decision can be explained on
other grounds. At the time of contracting, the risk of the Canal’s being closed for a 
very considerable time
 
was
not foreseen; nor was it foreseeable on the high standard of foreseeability required to exclude frustration. To the
extent that the parties did foresee the risk, they seem to have allocated it by the terms of the charterparty. This
took the form of a ‘time charter trip’, which provided that the voyage was to be paid for by the time it took, and
so indicated an intention to throw the risk of delay on the charterers. There seems to be no reason why the court
should, by applying the doctrine of frustration to foreseen events, reverse such an allocation of risks deliberately
made by the contracting parties. [Emphasis in the original.]
The result in 
The Eugenia
 
seems to be correct but the reasoning is suspect. There is
authority to support the proposition that a contract is not frustrated when the event
which has occurred is a foreseeable one (see, for example, 
Walton Harvey Ltd
 
v. 
Walker
& Homfrays Ltd
 
[1931] 1 Ch 274). Much is likely to turn on the meaning of
‘foreseeability’ in this context. Professor Treitel has suggested that foreseeability is
relevant to the question whether or not a party has assumed the risk of the occurrence of
the event in question (see to similar effect 
The ‘Sea Angel’
 
[2007] EWCA Civ 547, [2007]
2 Lloyd’s Rep 517, [127]–[128]). Thus he states (
Frustration and Force Majeure
 
(3rd
edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2014), para 13–012) that:
‘Foreseeability’ will support the inference of risk-assumption only where the supervening event is one which any
person of ordinary intelligence would regard as likely to occur, or … the contingency must be ‘one which the
parties could reasonably be thought to have foreseen as a real possibility’. The distinction is between cases in
which parties can reasonably be expected to foresee the occurrence of the event as no more than a possibility,
and those in which they can be so expected to foresee it as a real likelihood. The inference of risk assumption
will be drawn only in cases of the latter kind; and even then it may be displaced by [other factors].
A second point worth noting about 
The Eugenia
 
is the conclusion that the closure of the
Suez Canal did not result in the frustration of the contract between the parties. Those
responsible for the drafting of force majeure clauses have taken notice of this fact and it
is now common practice to include the closure of the Suez Canal in the list of events that
trigger the operation of a force majeure clause.
21.4
 
Self-Induced Frustration
The doctrine of self-induced frustration has been described in H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on
Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021, para 26–091, footnotes omitted) in the
following terms:
‘The essence of frustration is that it should not be due to the act or election of the party seeking to rely on it’.
Thus, a contracting party cannot rely on ‘self-induced frustration, that is, on frustration due to his own conduct
or to the conduct of those for whom he is responsible’. Although the concept of self-induced frustration is
clearly established as a matter of general principle, the precise limits of the doctrine have not been clearly
established. It is merely a ‘label’ which has been used to describe ‘those situations where one party has been
held by the Courts not to be entitled to treat himself as discharged from his contractual obligations’. Thus
frustration has been held to be ‘self-induced’ where the alleged frustrating event was caused by a breach or
anticipatory breach of contract by the party claiming that the contract has been frustrated, where an act of the
party claiming that the contract has been frustrated broke the chain of causation between the alleged frustrating
event and the event which made performance of the contract impossible, and where the alleged frustrating
event was not a supervening event or ‘something altogether outside the control of the parties’. A party who has
been at fault or whose act was deliberate will generally be unable to invoke frustration because of the difficulty
which such a party will inevitably face in showing the existence of a supervening event which is outside his
control.
The leading modern case on self-induced frustration is the decision of the Court of
Appeal in 
J Lauritzen AS
 
v. 
Wijsmuller BV (The ‘Super Servant Two’)
 
[1990] 1 Lloyd’s
Rep 1. The case is an important one for three reasons. First, it demonstrates the width of
the doctrine 
of self-induced frustration; secondly, the judgment of Bingham LJ contains
a modern definition of the doctrine of frustration; and thirdly, it demonstrates the
crucial role played by force majeure clauses in commercial contracts today.
J LAURITZEN AS V. WIJSMULLER BV (THE ‘SUPER
SERVANT TWO’)
[1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1, Court of Appeal
The defendants, Wijsmuller, agreed to carry the plaintiffs’ drilling rig, named the
Dan King
, from Japan to Rotterdam. The contract, dated 7 July 1980, provided that
the rig would be delivered between 20 June and 20 August 1981 and that it would
1.
(a)
(b)
2.
(a)
(b)
be carried using either 
Super Servant One
 
or 
Super Servant Two
 
at Wijsmuller’s
option. Both of these vessels were large, self-propelled, semi-submersible barges
built for carrying large loads such as the rig. Clause 17 of the contract (which is set
out in full in the judgment of Bingham LJ) gave Wijsmuller the right to cancel the
contract in the event of force majeure or any other circumstance which reasonably
prevented the performance of the contract. The defendants claimed that by
November 1980 they had made an internal decision, which they admitted was not
irrevocable, to schedule 
Super Servant Two
 
to transport the plaintiffs’ rig and to
allocate 
Super Servant One
 
to the performance of other concluded contracts. On
29 January 1981 
Super Servant Two
 
sank while transporting another rig. On 16
February 1981 Wijsmuller told Lauritzen that it could not carry the rig using either
Super Servant One
 
or 
Super Servant Two
. It could not use 
Super Servant One
because it was required for the performance of other contracts and it could not use
Super Servant Two
 
because it had sunk. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants’
failure to transport the rig in the agreed manner was a breach of contract so that
the defendants were liable for the additional costs that had been incurred in
transporting the rig by another method. The defendants pleaded that the contract
had been frustrated and they also relied on clause 17 as a defence to the claim
brought by the plaintiffs.
Four issues were ordered to be tried, namely:
whether the defendants were entitled to cancel the contract under clause
17
If the loss of the 
Super Servant Two
 
occurred without the negligence
of the Defendants, their servants or agents.
If the loss of the 
Super Servant Two
 
was caused by the negligence
of the Defendants, their servants or agents.
whether the contract was frustrated
If the loss of the 
Super Servant Two
 
occurred without the negligence
of the Defendants, their servants or agents.
If the loss of the 
Super Servant Two
 
was caused by the negligence
of the Defendants, their servants or agents.
Mr Justice Hobhouse answered ‘yes’ to question 1(a) and ‘no’ to questions 1(b),
2(a), and 2(b). The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal against the
conclusion of Hobhouse J in relation to questions 1(b), 2(a), and 2(b). The Court of
Appeal dismissed the appeal. Consequently the defendants were unable to invoke
the doctrine of frustration and were only able to rely on clause 17 if the loss of
Super Servant Two
 
occurred without the negligence of the defendants.
Bingham LJ
The contract of carriage was expressly governed by English law and not many of
its terms are germane to these preliminary issues. …
Clause 17 was the subject of two issues argued before the Judge, one of which
remains in contention on appeal. I should recite its … terms:
17.
 
Cancellation
17.1. Wijsmuller has the right to cancel its performance under this Contract
whether the loading has been completed or not, in the event of force majeur (sic),
Acts of God, perils or danger and accidents of the sea, acts of war, warlike-
operations, acts of public enemies, restraint of princes, rulers or people or seizure
under legal process, quarantine restrictions, civil commotions, blockade, strikes,
lockout, closure of the Suez or Panama Canal, congestion of harbours or any other
circumstances whatsoever, causing extra-ordinary periods of delay and similar
events and/or circumstances, abnormal increases in prices and wages, scarcity of
fuel and similar events, which reasonably may impede, prevent or delay the
performance of this contract.
[He set out the facts of the case and the four issues ordered to be tried and
continued]
Question 1(b)
The learned Judge answered question 1(a) in favour of Wijsmuller because he
rejected Lauritzen’s argument that cl. 17 did not apply before arrival of the carrying
vessel at the loading site. It was not disputed that the loss of 
Super Servant Two
was capable of being a circumstance which might reasonably impede or delay the
performance of the contract within the meaning of cl. 17. The question for decision
is whether, on a proper construction of cl. 17 read in the context of the contract as
a whole and of relevant background circumstances, Wijsmuller were entitled to
cancel the contract under cl. 17 if the loss of 
Super Servant Two
 
was caused by
1.
their (or their servants’ or agents’) negligence before the time for performance had
arrived. It was common ground that the Court’s task is to elicit the parties’
intentions from the contract they made according to familiar principles of
construction …
[He concluded that the expression ‘perils or dangers and accidents of the sea’
could not be read alone but had to be read as part of the contract as a whole. He
stated that, although clause 17 did not attempt to exclude liability for negligence, it
conferred upon the defendants a ‘right exercisable in a very wide range of
circumstances to nullify the contractual bargain made between the parties at no
cost to [the defendants] and regardless of the loss’ to the plaintiffs. Therefore he
concluded that the ‘broad approach’ adopted by the Privy Council in 
Canada
Steamship
 
v. 
The King
 
[1952] AC 192 was applicable to the construction of clause
17. Applying the three rules of construction derived from 
Canada Steamship
 
[on
which see 
13.2.1
] Bingham LJ held that clause 17.1 did not expressly cover
negligence on the part of the defendants. At the second stage he held that clause
17 was wide enough on its ordinary construction to cover negligence on the part of
the defendants. But at the third stage he held that clause 17 was not ‘deprived of a
sensible application’ if it was confined to events which were not brought about by
the negligence of the defendants, their employees, or agents. Almost all of the
events listed in clause 17 were events which were beyond the direct or indirect
control of the defendants. This being the case, clause 17 did not provide the
defendants with protection in the event that 
Super Servant Two
 
sank as a result of
the negligence of the defendants.]
Question 2: general
The argument in this case raises important issues on the English law of frustration.
Before turning to the specific questions I think it helpful to summarize the
established law so far as relevant to this case. …
Certain propositions, established by the highest authority, are not open to
question:
The doctrine of frustration was evolved to mitigate the rigour of the common
law’s insistence on literal performance of absolute promises … The object
of the doctrine was to give effect to the demands of justice, to achieve a just
and reasonable result, to do what is reasonable and fair, as an expedient to
2.
3.
4.
5.
escape from injustice where such would result from enforcement of a
contract in its literal terms after a significant change in circumstances …
Since the effect of frustration is to kill the contract and discharge the parties
from further liability under it, the doctrine is not to be lightly invoked, must
be kept within very narrow limits and ought not to be extended …
Frustration brings the contract to an end forthwith, without more and
automatically …
The essence of frustration is that it should not be due to the act or election
of the party seeking to rely on it … A frustrating event must be some outside
event or extraneous change of situation.
A frustrating event must take place without blame or fault on the side of the
party seeking to rely on it.
Question 2(a)
The doctrine of frustration depends on a comparison between circumstances as
they are or are assumed to be when a contract is made and circumstances as they
are when a contract is, or would be, due to be performed. It is trite law that
disappointed expectations do not of themselves give rise to frustrated contracts. To
frustrate, an event must significantly change—
‘ … the nature (not merely the expense or onerousness) of the outstanding contractual rights and/or
obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of [the contract’s]
execution … [
National Carriers Ltd
 
sup., at p. 700, per Lord Simon of Glaisdale].
Had the 
Dan King
 
contract provided for carriage by 
Super Servant Two
 
with no
alternative, and that vessel had been lost before the time for performance, then
assuming no negligence by Wijsmuller (as for purposes of this question we must), I
feel sure the contract would have been frustrated. The doctrine must avail a party
who contracts to perform a contract of carriage with a vessel which, through no
fault of his, no longer exists. But that is not this case. The 
Dan King
 
contract did
provide an alternative. When that contract was made one of the contracts
eventually performed by 
Super Servant One
 
during the period of contractual
carriage of 
Dan King
 
had been made, the other had not, at any rate finally.
Wijsmuller have not alleged that when the 
Dan King
 
contract was made either
vessel was earmarked for its performance. That, no doubt, is why an option was
contracted for. Had it been foreseen when the 
Dan King
 
contract was made that
Super Servant Two
 
would be unavailable for performance, whether because she
had been deliberately sold or accidentally sunk, Lauritzen at least would have
thought it no matter since the carriage could be performed with the other. I
accordingly accept [the] submission [of counsel for the plaintiffs] that the present
case does not fall within the very limited class of cases in which the law will relieve
one party from an absolute promise he has chosen to make.
But I also accept [counsel for the plaintiffs’] submission that Wijsmuller’s
argument is subject to other fatal flaws. If, as was argued, the contract was
frustrated when Wijsmuller made or communicated their decision on Feb. 16, it
deprives language of all meaning to describe the contract as coming to an end
automatically. It was, indeed, because the contract did not come to an end
automatically on Jan. 29, that Wijsmuller needed a fortnight to review their
schedules and their commercial options. I cannot, furthermore, reconcile
Wijsmuller’s argument with the reasoning or the decision in 
Maritime National Fish
Ltd
. In that case the Privy Council declined to speculate why the charterers
selected three of the five vessels to be licensed but, as I understand the case,
regarded the interposition of human choice after the allegedly frustrating event as
fatal to the plea of frustration. If Wijsmuller are entitled to succeed here, I cannot
see why the charterers lost there. The cases on frustrating delay do not, I think,
help Wijsmuller since it is actual and prospective delay (whether or not recognized
as frustrating by a party at the time) which frustrates the contract, not a party’s
election or decision to treat the delay as frustrating. I have no doubt that force
majeure clauses are, where their terms permit, to be construed and applied as in
the commodity cases on which Wijsmuller relied, but it is in my view inconsistent
with the doctrine of frustration as previously understood on high authority that its
application should depend on any decision, however reasonable and commercial,
of the party seeking to rely on it.
I reach the same conclusion as the Judge for the reasons which he lucidly and
persuasively gave.
Question 2(b)
The issue between the parties was short and fundamental: what is meant by
saying that a frustrating event, to be relied on, must occur without the fault or
default, or without blame attaching to, the party relying on it?
[Counsel for the defendant’s] answer was that a party was precluded from
relying on an event only when he had acted deliberately or in breach of an
actionable duty in causing it. Those conditions were not met here since it was not
alleged Wijsmuller sank 
Super Servant Two
 
deliberately and at the material time
Wijsmuller owed Lauritzen no duty of care.
[Counsel for the plaintiffs] argued for a less restrictive approach …
[The defendant’s] test would, in my judgment, confine the law in a legalistic
strait-jacket and distract attention from the real question, which is whether the
frustrating event relied upon is truly an outside event or extraneous change of
situation or whether it is an event which the party seeking to rely on it had the
means and opportunity to prevent but nevertheless caused or permitted to come
about. A fine test of legal duty is inappropriate; what is needed is a pragmatic
judgment whether a party seeking to rely on an event as discharging him from a
contractual promise was himself responsible for the occurrence of that event.
Lauritzen have pleaded in some detail the grounds on which they say that
Super Servant Two
 
was lost as a result of the carelessness of Wijsmuller, their
servants or agents. If those allegations are made good to any significant extent
Wijsmuller would (even if my answer to Question 2(a) is wrong) be precluded from
relying on their plea of frustration.
I would answer this question also as the Judge did and would therefore dismiss
the appeal.
Dillon LJ
Issues 2(a) and (b) are concerned with frustration. Was the contract frustrated by
the sinking of 
Super Servant Two
 
or by that event coupled with the subsequent
election by the defendants to use 
Super Servant One
 
on other voyages and not for
carrying the 
Dan King
? 
The important factor, common to both issues, is that under
the contract the defendants could have satisfied their obligation by using 
Super
Servant One
 
to carry the rig, after 
Super Servant Two
 
had sunk, but they elected
not to do so.
In this respect, the present case appears to be a direct parallel to that
described by Lord Wright in 
Maritime National Fish Ltd
 
v. 
Ocean Trawlers Ltd
[1935] AC 524 at pp. 529–530 where he said:
‘ … in [their Lordships] judgment the case could be properly decided on the simple conclusion that it was
the act and election of the appellants which prevented the St. Cuthbert being licensed for fishing with an
otter trawl. It is clear that the appellants were free to select any three of the five trawlers they were
operating and could, had they willed, have selected the St. Cuthbert as one, in which event a licence
would have been granted to her. It is immaterial to speculate why they preferred to put forward for
licences the three trawlers which they actually selected nor is it material, as between the appellants and
the respondents, that the appellants were operating other trawlers to three of which they gave the
preference. What matters is that they could have got a licence for the St. Cuthbert if they had so minded.
If the case be figured as one in which the St. Cuthbert was removed from the category of privileged
trawlers, it was by the appellant’s hand that she was so removed because it was their hand that guided
the hand of the Minister in placing the licences where he did and thereby excluding the St. Cuthbert. The
essence of “frustration” is that it should not be due to the act or election of the party.’
The parallel seems to be even closer, if, as some of the documents seem to
suggest, the defendants, after the loss of the 
Super Servant Two
, negotiated extra
fees with the parties with whom they had other contracts of carriage before finally
allocating the 
Super Servant One
 
to perform those other contracts.
It is the view of Professor Treitel, expressed both in his own book on the Law of
Contract—see the 7th edn at pp. 674–675 and 700–701—and in the current
editions of well-known textbooks of which he is editor or an editor, that where a
party has entered into a number of contracts with other parties and an
uncontemplated supervening event has the result that he is deprived of the means
of satisfying all those contracts, he can, provided he acts ‘reasonably’ in making
his election, elect to use such means as remains available to him to perform some
of the contracts, and claim that the others, which he does not perform, have been
frustrated by the supervening event. The reasoning depends on the proposition
that if it is known to those concerned that the party will have entered into
commitments with others and if he acts ‘reasonably’ in his allocation of his
remaining means to his commitments, the chain of causation between the
uncontemplated supervening event and the non-performance of those of his
contracts which will not have been performed will not have been broken by the
election to apply his remaining means in a ‘reasonable’ way. Similar reasoning
was, as my Lord has pointed out, used by Mr Justice Robert Goff in relation to an
exceptions clause in the unreported case of 
Westfälische Central-Genossenschaft
GmbH
 
v. 
Seabright Chemicals Ltd
.
Such an approach is however inconsistent to my mind with the view expressed
by Lord Wright in that passage in 
Maritime National Fish
 
which I have already
cited, where he said:
‘It is immaterial to speculate why they preferred to put forward for licences the three trawlers which they
actually selected.’
It is also, as my Lord has pointed out, inconsistent with the long accepted view that
frustration brings the contract to an end forthwith, without more ado automatically.
Plainly the 
sinking of 
Super Servant Two
 
did not do that, since even after that
sinking the defendants could have used 
Super Servant One
 
to perform the
contract.
We in this Court should apply 
Maritime National Fish
 
and the other authorities
to which my Lord has referred. Accordingly I agree with my Lord and the learned
Judge that issues 2(a) and (b) should be answered in the negative.
Commentary
The 
Super Servant Two
 
is a case of considerable significance. This is so for a number of
reasons. First, it demonstrates the practical significance of force majeure clauses. The
defendants found some protection in clause 17 but not in the doctrine of frustration.
Indeed, in many ways the narrowness of the doctrine of frustration can be explained on
the basis that it is open to the parties to protect their own position by an appropriately
drafted force majeure clause (see 
12.3.5
). Secondly, it is an important case in relation to
the interpretation of force majeure clauses in that it demonstrates that the courts are
unlikely to conclude, in the absence of very clear words, that a force majeure clause is
apt to encompass events caused by the negligence of the party relying upon the clause.
The reason for this is that the events listed in the clause are generally events that are
beyond the control of the parties (such as ‘acts of God’, ‘wars’, etc.) and, this being the
case, the court is likely to presume that all events listed in the clause are beyond their
control.
Thirdly, the case demonstrates that a party who has been at fault will generally not be
entitled to invoke the doctrine of frustration. The defendants in 
Super Servant Two
argued that it was only when they had acted deliberately or were in breach of a duty of
care which they owed to the plaintiffs that they would be precluded from relying upon
the doctrine of frustration. Bingham LJ rejected this submission on the ground that it
would ‘confine the law in a legalistic strait-jacket’. The view adopted by the Court of
Appeal was that a frustrating event must, by definition, take place ‘without blame or
fault on the side of the party seeking to rely’ upon the doctrine of frustration. So, if the
sinking of Super Servant Two occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendants,
that of itself would have sufficed to prevent the defendants from relying upon
frustration.
The final point relates to the fact that the defendants had a choice as to the allocation of
Super Servant One. In the view of the Court of Appeal the fact that the defendants had a
choice meant that the alleged frustrating event was brought about by their own act or
election and not by a supervening event. Adopting a strict approach to the interpretation
of the decision of the Privy Council in 
Maritime National Fish Ltd
 
v. 
Ocean Trawlers
Ltd
 
[1935] AC 524, the Court of Appeal held that it was irrelevant that the defendants in
Super Servant Two
 
had no 
real
 
choice as to the allocation of Super Servant One in that
it was impossible to allocate it to the performance of all concluded contracts. Cases
relied upon to support the proposition that the defendants could invoke the doctrine of
frustration if they had acted reasonably in their allocation of Super Servant One were
distinguished on the ground that they were concerned with the interpretation of force
majeure clauses and not with the doctrine of frustration. This conclusion would appear
to leave a party in the position of the defendants in this case in a very difficult position.
Two practical steps can be taken to mitigate the rigours of the decision. The first is to
eliminate any choice on the part of the defendants. Bingham LJ stated that, had the
contract been to perform the contract with Super Servant Two, the sinking of that vessel,
without negligence on the part of the defendants, would 
have entitled the defendants to
seek relief under the doctrine of frustration. The second step is to insert an
appropriately drafted force majeure clause into the contract. This takes us back to our
first point, namely the crucial role played by force majeure clauses in modern
commercial contracts.
21.5
 
Frustrating Events
It is only in the rare case where (i) the contract does not make provision for the event
that has occurred, (ii) the event was not foreseen by the parties and was not sufficiently
foreseeable, and (iii) the alleged frustrating event was not ‘self-induced’ that a court has
to decide whether or not a contract has been frustrated. Cases involving frustrated
contracts can be divided into three groups.
21.5.1
 
Impossibility
The classic example of a frustrated contract is a contract that has become impossible to
perform. 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
(
21.1
) falls into this category. 
Taylor
 
was a case of partial
rather than total impossibility in that it was still possible for the parties to make use of
the Surrey Gardens. But use of the Gardens only would have been a very different
contract from that which had originally been concluded by the parties. A contract of
employment is frustrated on the death of the employee. More difficult is the case where
the employee becomes incapacitated. Much depends upon the extent of the incapacity;
the greater it is, both in extent and duration, the more likely it is that the contract of
employment will be frustrated. A contract may also be frustrated where the subject
matter of the contract is unavailable for use in the performance of the contract (
Jackson
v. 
Union Marine Insurance Co Ltd
 
(1874) LR 10 CP 125, where the charter of a ship
which subsequently ran aground was held to have been frustrated as a result of the
unavailability of the vessel for the contracted voyage). Where the unavailability is partial
only (that is to say it is only unavailable for a proportion of the contract period) the
court must have regard to the extent of the unavailability. The greater the extent, in
relation to the time-scale of the contract, the more likely it is that the contract will be
frustrated (
The Nema
 
[1982] AC 724).
21.5.2
 
Illegality
The second group of cases concerns contracts that have become illegal after the date of
formation. These cases differ from cases where the illegality affected the contract from
the outset. Cases that fall within this section are contracts that were valid when formed
but have become illegal as a result of the occurrence of events subsequent to the making
of the contract. An example is provided by the case of 
Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna
 
v.
Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd
 
[1943] AC 32. A contract to sell machinery to
buyers in Poland was frustrated when Poland was occupied by Germany in the Second
World War (it being illegal to trade with the enemy in times of war). Public policy
considerations operate very strongly in this area (
Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping
Lines
 
v. 
Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association (Bermuda) Ltd
 
[2010] EWHC
2661 (Comm), [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 195, [100]). In cases involving subsequent illegality,
the operation of the doctrine of frustration cannot be excluded by an express term of the
contract (
Ertel Bieber and Co
 
v. 
Rio Tinto Co Ltd
 
[1918] 
AC 260) nor can it be excluded
on the ground that the supervening illegality was foreseen by the contracting parties.
The reason for this is that public policy considerations will generally deny to contracting
parties the entitlement to provide that the agreement is to be performed
notwithstanding any illegality. In other words, public policy here trumps the autonomy
of the contracting parties. A contract governed by English law is not, as a general rule,
affected by the validity of the contract according to the law of another jurisdiction unless
performance has become illegal by the law of the jurisdiction where performance is to
take place (a rule affirmed by Marcus Smith J in 
Canary Wharf (BP4) T1 Ltd
 
v.
European Medicines Agency
 
[2019] EWHC 335 (Ch), 183 Con LR 167).
Difficult questions can arise where the supervening illegality affects part only of the
contract. These cases involve questions of degree. The court must examine the impact of
the illegality on the contract. Where the illegality affects the contract in a substantial or a
fundamental way then the contract is likely to be frustrated (
Denny, Mott & Dickson
 
v.
James B Fraser & Co Ltd
 
[1944] AC 265). Conversely, where its impact is insubstantial
the contract will not be frustrated (
Cricklewood Property & Investment Trust Ltd
 
v.
Leightons Investment Trust Ltd
 
[1945] AC 221).
21.5.3
 
Frustration of Purpose
The most difficult cases are those in which it is alleged that the purpose of the contract
has been frustrated. The courts have exercised considerable caution in order to ensure
that frustration does not become a convenient escape route for a party who discovers
that he has entered into a bad bargain. More often than not, attempts to invoke the
doctrine of frustration in this context have failed (see, for example, 
Davis Contractors
Ltd
 
v. 
Fareham Urban District Council
 
[1956] AC 696, 
21.1
; 
Amalgamated Investment
& Property Co Ltd
 
v. 
John Walker & Sons Ltd
 
[1977] 1 WLR 164; and 
Canary Wharf
(BP4) T1 Ltd
 
v. 
European Medicines Agency
 
[2019] EWHC 335 (Ch), 183 Con LR 167).
The case that gives rise to difficulty is the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Krell
 
v.
Henry
 
[1903] 2 KB 740. It gives rise to difficulty on two grounds. First, why did the
Court of Appeal conclude that the contract had been frustrated? Secondly, what is the
difference between 
Krell
 
(where the contract was frustrated) and the decision of the
Court of Appeal in 
Herne Bay Steam Boat Company
 
v. 
Hutton
 
[1903] 2 KB 683, later in
this section (where the contract was not frustrated)? It is important to examine 
Krell
and 
Hutton
 
together (alongside the example given by Vaughan Williams LJ in 
Krell
 
of
the cab driver who agrees to take a passenger to Epsom on Derby Day). The commentary
will therefore follow the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Hutton.
KRELL V. HENRY
[1903] 2 KB 740, Court of Appeal
Krell owned a flat on the third floor at 56A Pall Mall. As it had been announced that
the King’s coronation procession would pass along Pall Mall on 26 and 27 June
1902, Henry agreed to hire Krell’s flat on those days. On 20 June Krell and Henry
entered into a written contract which made no reference to the coronation
processions or to any other purpose for which the flat was taken. The agreement
stated that Henry was to have ‘the entire use of these rooms during the days (but
not the nights)’. Henry paid a deposit of £25 and 
agreed to pay the balance of £50
on 24 June. The King became seriously ill and the coronation procession did not
take place. Henry refused to pay the balance and Krell brought an action to
recover it. Henry counterclaimed for the return of the £25. The trial judge held that
Henry was not liable to pay the £50 and that he was entitled to the return of the
£25. Krell appealed to the Court of Appeal who dismissed the appeal and held that
he was not entitled to demand the balance of £50 on the ground that the contract
between the parties had been frustrated.
Vaughan Williams LJ
The real question in this case is the extent of the application in English law of the
principle of the Roman law which has been adopted and acted on in many English
decisions, and notably in the case of 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
3 B & S 826 … English law
applies the principle not only to cases where the performance of the contract
becomes impossible by the cessation of existence of the thing which is the subject
matter of the contract, but also to cases where the event which renders the
contract incapable of performance is the cessation or non-existence of an express
condition or state of things, going to the root of the contract, and essential to its
performance. It is said, on the one side, that the specified thing, state of things, or
condition the continued existence of which is necessary for the fulfilment of the
contract, so that the parties entering into the contract must have contemplated the
continued existence of that thing, condition, or state of things as the foundation of
what was to be done under the contract, is limited to things which are either the
subject matter of the contract or a condition or state of things, present or
anticipated, which is expressly mentioned in the contract. But, on the other side, it
is said that the condition or state of things need not be expressly specified, but that
it is sufficient if that condition or state of things clearly appears by extrinsic
evidence to have been assumed by the parties to be the foundation or basis of the
contract, and the event which causes the impossibility is of such a character that it
cannot reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the
contracting parties when the contract was made. In such a case the contracting
parties will not be held bound by the general words which, though large enough to
include, were not used with reference to a possibility of a particular event rendering
performance of the contract impossible. I do not think that the principle of the civil
law as introduced into the English law is limited to cases in which the event
causing the impossibility of performance is the destruction or non-existence of
some thing which is the subject matter of the contract or of some condition or state
of things expressly specified as a condition of it. I think that you first have to
ascertain, not necessarily from the terms of the contract, but, if required, from
necessary inferences, drawn from surrounding circumstances recognised by both
contracting parties, what is the substance of the contract, and then to ask the
question whether that substantial contract needs for its foundation the assumption
of the existence of a particular state of things. If it does, this will limit the operation
of the general words, and in such case, if the contract becomes impossible of
performance by reason of the non-existence of the state of things assumed by
both contracting parties as the foundation of the contract, there will be no breach of
the contract thus limited. Now what are the facts of the present case?
[He set out the facts and continued]
In my judgment the use of the rooms was let and taken for the purpose of
seeing the Royal procession. It was not a demise of the rooms, or even an
agreement to let and take the rooms. It is a licence to use rooms for a particular
purpose and none other. And in my judgment the taking place of those processions
on the days proclaimed along the proclaimed 
route, which passed 56A, Pall Mall,
was regarded by both contracting parties as the foundation of the contract; and I
think that it cannot reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of
the contracting parties, when the contract was made, that the coronation would not
be held on the proclaimed days, or the processions not take place on those days
along the proclaimed route; and I think that the words imposing on the defendant
the obligation to accept and pay for the use of the rooms for the named days,
although general and unconditional, were not used with reference to the possibility
of the particular contingency which afterwards occurred. It was suggested in the
course of the argument that if the occurrence, on the proclaimed days, of the
coronation and the procession in this case were the foundation of the contract, and
if the general words are thereby limited or qualified, so that in the event of the non-
occurrence of the coronation and procession along the proclaimed route they
would discharge both parties from further performance of the contract, it would
follow that if a cabman was engaged to take some one to Epsom on Derby Day at
a suitable enhanced price for such a journey, say 10l., both parties to the contract
would be discharged in the contingency of the race at Epsom for some reason
becoming impossible; but I do not think this follows, for I do not think that in the cab
case the happening of the race would be the foundation of the contract. No doubt
the purpose of the engager would be to go to see the Derby, and the price would
be proportionately high; but the cab had no special qualifications for the purpose
which led to the selection of the cab for this particular occasion. Any other cab
would have done as well. Moreover, I think that, under the cab contract, the hirer,
even if the race went off, could have said, ‘Drive me to Epsom; I will pay you the
agreed sum; you have nothing to do with the purpose for which I hired the cab’,
and that if the cabman refused he would have been guilty of a breach of contract,
there being nothing to qualify his promise to drive the hirer to Epsom on a
particular day. Whereas in the case of the coronation, there is not merely the
purpose of the hirer to see the coronation procession, but it is the coronation
procession and the relative position of the rooms which is the basis of the contract
as much for the lessor as the hirer; and I think that if the King, before the
coronation day and after the contract, had died, the hirer could not have insisted
on having the rooms on the days named. It could not in the cab case be
reasonably said that seeing the Derby race was the foundation of the contract, as it
was of the licence in this case. Whereas in the present case, where the rooms
were offered and taken, by reason of their peculiar suitability from the position of
the rooms for a view of the coronation procession, surely the view of the
coronation procession was the foundation of the contract, which is a very different
thing from the purpose of the man who engaged the cab—namely, to see the race
—being held to be the foundation of the contract. Each case must be judged by its
own circumstances. In each case one must ask oneself, first, what, having regard
to all the circumstances, was the foundation of the contract? Secondly, was the
performance of the contract prevented? Thirdly, was the event which prevented the
performance of the contract of such a character that it cannot reasonably be said
to have been in the contemplation of the parties at the date of the contract? If all
these questions are answered in the affirmative (as I think they should be in this
case), I think both parties are discharged from further performance of the contract.
Romer LJ
With some doubt I have also come to the conclusion that this case is governed by
the principle on which 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
was decided, and accordingly that the
appeal must be dismissed. The doubt I have felt was whether the parties to the
contract now before us could be said, under the circumstances, not to have had at
all in their contemplation the risk that for some reason or other the coronation
processions might not take place on the days fixed, or, if the 
processions took
place, might not pass so as to be capable of being viewed from the rooms
mentioned in the contract; and whether, under this contract, that risk was not
undertaken by the defendant. But on the question of fact as to what was in the
contemplation of the parties at the time, I do not think it right to differ from the
conclusion arrived at by Vaughan Williams LJ.
Stirling LJsaid he had an opportunity of reading the judgment delivered by
Vaughan Williams LJ, with which he entirely agreed. Though the case was one of
very great difficulty, he thought it came within the principle of 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
.
HERNE BAY STEAM BOAT COMPANY V. HUTTON
[1903] 2 KB 683, Court of Appeal
The Herne Bay Steam Boat Company owned a steamboat called 
Cynthia
. Early in
1902 it was announced that there would be a Royal naval review at Spithead on 28
June 1902. Hutton, the defendant, wanted to charter 
Cynthia
 
to carry passengers
to see the review. Herne Bay and Hutton signed an agreement on 23 May 1902,
which stated that 
Cynthia
 
would be at the disposal of Hutton on 28 June ‘for the
purpose of viewing the naval review and for a day’s cruise round the fleet’ and on
29 June ‘for similar purposes’. Hutton paid a deposit of £50 and agreed to pay the
balance of £200 before 
Cynthia
 
left Herne Bay. On 25 June the naval review was
cancelled. On the same day Herne Bay wired Hutton for instructions, stating that
Cynthia
 
was ready to start, but received no reply. On 28 and 29 June Herne Bay
used 
Cynthia
 
for its own purposes and made a profit of £90. On 29 June, Hutton
called Herne Bay and stated that, as the naval review had been cancelled, he no
longer required 
Cynthia
 
and would not pay the balance of £200. Herne Bay
brought an action to recover £110. Hutton counterclaimed for the return of his £50
deposit. The judge held that Herne Bay was not entitled to the £110 but that Hutton
was not entitled to the £50. The Court of Appeal allowed Herne Bay’s appeal. It
held that the contract between the parties had not been frustrated and that Herne
Bay was accordingly entitled to recover £110 from Hutton by way of damages for
his breach of contract.
Vaughan Williams LJ
Mr Hutton, in hiring this vessel, had two objects in view: first, of taking people to
see the naval review, and, secondly, of taking them round the fleet. Those, no
doubt, were the purposes of Mr Hutton, but it does not seem to me that because,
as it is said, those purposes became impossible, it would be a very legitimate
inference that the happening of the naval review was contemplated by both parties
as the basis and foundation of this contract, so as to bring the case within the
doctrine of 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
3 B & S 826. On the contrary, when the contract is
properly regarded, I think the purpose of Mr Hutton, whether of seeing the naval
review or of going round the fleet with a party of paying guests, does not lay the
foundation of the contract within the authorities …
I see nothing that makes this contract differ from a case where, for instance, a
person has engaged a brake to take himself and a party to Epsom to see the races
there, but for some reason or other, such as the spread of an infectious disease,
the races are postponed. In such a case it could not be said that he could be
relieved of his bargain. So in the present case it is sufficient to say that the
happening of the naval review was not the foundation of the contract.
Romer LJ
This case is not one in which the subject matter of the contract is a mere licence to
the defendant to use a ship for the purpose of seeing the naval review and going
round the fleet. In my opinion, as my Lord has said, it is a contract for the hiring of
a ship by the defendant for a certain voyage, though having, no doubt, a special
object, namely, to see the naval review and the fleet; but it appears to me that the
object was a matter with which the defendant, as hirer of the ship, was alone
concerned, and not the plaintiffs, the owners of the ship.
The case cannot, in my opinion, be distinguished in principle from many
common cases in which, on the hiring of a ship, you find the objects of the hiring
stated. Very often you find the details of the voyage stated with particularity, and
also the nature and details of the cargo to be carried. If the voyage is intended to
be one of pleasure, the object in view may also be stated, which is a matter that
concerns the passengers. But this statement of the objects of the hirer of the ship
would not, in my opinion, justify him in saying that the owner of the ship had those
objects just as much in view as the hirer himself. The owner would say, ‘I have an
interest in the ship as a passenger or cargo carrying machine, and I enter into the
contract simply in that capacity; it is for the hirer to concern himself about the
objects’.
… The ship (as a ship) had nothing particular to do with the review or the fleet
except as a convenient carrier of passengers to see it: any other ship suitable for
carrying passengers would have done equally as well. Just as in the case of the
hire of a cab or other vehicle, although the object of the hirer might be stated, that
statement would not make the object any the less a matter for the hirer alone, and
would not directly affect the person who was letting out the vehicle for hire. In the
present case I may point out that it cannot be said that by reason of the failure to
hold the naval review there was a total failure of consideration. That cannot be so.
Nor is there anything like a total destruction of the subject matter of the contract.
Nor can we, in my opinion, imply in this contract any condition in favour of the
defendant which would enable him to escape liability. A condition ought only to be
implied in order to carry out the presumed intention of the parties, and I cannot
ascertain any such presumed intention here. It follows that, in my opinion, so far as
the plaintiffs are concerned, the objects of the passengers on this voyage with
regard to sight-seeing do not form the subject matter or essence of this contract.
Stirling LJ
It is said that, by reason of the reference in the contract to the ‘naval review’, the
existence of the review formed the basis of the contract, and that as the review
failed to take place the parties became discharged from the further performance of
the contract, in accordance with the doctrine of 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
3 B & S 826. I
am unable to arrive at that conclusion. It seems to me that the reference in the
contract to the naval review is easily explained; it was inserted in order to define
more exactly the nature of the voyage, and I am unable to treat it as being such a
reference as to constitute the naval review the foundation of the contract so as to
entitle either party to the benefit of the doctrine in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
. I come to this
conclusion the more readily because the object of the voyage is not limited to the
naval review, but also extends to a cruise round the fleet. The fleet was there, and
passengers might have been found willing to go round it. It is true that in the event
which happened the object of the voyage became limited, but, in my opinion, that
was the risk of the defendant whose venture the taking the passengers was. For
these reasons I am unable to agree with the learned judge in holding that in the
contemplation of the parties the taking place of the review was the basis for the
performance of the contract, and I think that the defendant is not discharged from
its performance.
Commentary
Krell
 
is a difficult case: it has its supporters and its critics. It has never been overruled
but, at the same time, the courts have been reluctant to apply it in other contexts. What
is the difference between 
Krell
 
and 
Hutton?
 
And why is a contract to hire a room for the
purpose of viewing the coronation frustrated on the cancellation of the coronation when
a contract to pay a cab driver a suitably enhanced price to take a passenger to Epsom on
Derby Day is not frustrated on the cancellation of the Derby? The most extensive judicial
analysis of these questions as a matter of English law is to be found in the judgment of
Marcus Smith J in 
Canary Wharf (BP4) T1 Ltd
 
v. 
European Medicines Agency
 
[2019]
EWHC 335 (Ch), 183 Con LR 167 in the following terms:
37 (1) The reason Vaughan Williams LJ considered [his example] of the hire of the cab to Epsom on Derby Day
to be such a clear example of a non-frustrating event is because the cab driver’s price was simply a reflection of
an excess of demand for cabs over their supply, with the cab driver’s price being correspondingly high as a
result. In short, the high price was simply a reflection of market forces, with the cab driver being entirely
indifferent as to the purpose of the journey and indeed its destination, whilst the passenger would be concerned
not with the identity of the cab driver, but merely with the objective of securing a cab—any cab—to go to the
stated destination. The high price, in other words, is nothing to do with a common purpose, but entirely a
reflection of the opposing interests of cab driver and passenger, mediated through the market forces of supply
and demand. In the case of this example, the market forces enabled the cab driver to charge a premium: the fact
that, the premium having been agreed, the passenger’s underlying purpose of the journey fell away, would be a
matter of indifference to the cab driver.
(2) The point could be tested in the following way: suppose the passenger wanted to make the journey for an
altogether different purpose (to visit a relative in Epsom), but was forced to pay a higher price because of the
coincidence of the timing of the visit to the relative and the Epsom races. The cancellation of the race might well
have an effect on market price (demand for cabs would fall), but one could surely not say that the ‘purpose’ of
the contract had been undermined by the cancellation of the race: the relative would still be in Epsom to be
visited. Conversely, if the relative became unavailable to be visited, but the races still went on, the passenger
(whose purpose would have been thwarted) would still be held to the contract.
(3) In the 
Herne Bay
 
case … the defendant was taking advantage of the review (occasioned by the
Coronation) to make a profit through his own venture. No doubt he paid more for hiring the vessel than he
would have done but for the Coronation; but, equally, would have more passengers and/or be able to charge
more to the passengers for the same reason. The risk of an absence of high demand for the trips he was offering
was the defendant’s. The cancellation of the review doubtless meant that fewer people would want to buy tickets
from the defendant. But the venture was always possible: it is simply that one factor adversely affecting demand
arose subsequent to the contract. As the Court of Appeal said, the venture was the defendant’s alone, as was the
risk of the venture failing. As in the case of the cab driver, the interests and purposes of the parties to the
contract were in essence opposed: each, in his own way, was trying to make a profit out of the occasion.
(4) In 
Krell v. Henry
 
… what the parties were buying and selling was, quite literally, a room with a view.
Their common purpose was just that: whilst the parties surely would have been in opposition in bargaining on
price, the thing that they were bargaining about was predicated on the procession taking place. Matters would
have been very different had the room been a 
hotel room charging a higher rate because of the higher demand
for rooms on that particular day due to the Coronation.
38.
 
The coronation cases show that where the supervening event causes one party to appreciate—with the
benefit of hindsight—that he or she has made a bad bargain, there will be no frustration of a common purpose.
If the only effect of the supervening event is to cause the price for the bargain to appear—in hindsight—to be too
high, the contract will not be frustrated. (By ‘price’ I should stress that I mean more than simply the
consideration agreed to be paid, but all of the terms that go to define the benefit one party to the contract
confers on the other.) That was the position both in the case of Vaughan Williams LJ’s cab driver and in the
facts of the 
Herne Bay
 
case. In both of those cases, one party paid more due to market conditions that
subsequently changed: the passenger paid more because of the high demand due to the races; the defendant in
Herne Bay
 
paid more because of the naval review. In each case, were the price bargained for to be adjusted in
the light of the new, supervening, market conditions, neither party would be able to complain. That
demonstrates that there was, in these cases, no common purpose to be frustrated: one party was simply
complaining that he had made what was, in retrospect, a bad bargain. By contrast, even if the price paid by the
licensee in 
Krell v. Henry
 
were to be dramatically reduced, the purpose of the contract would still be
undermined. In 
Krell v. Henry
, the point of the contract was the purchase and sale of a room with a view: the
view never came to pass.
One difficulty with this analysis lies in the claim that the ‘price’ charged is simply a
reflection of the operation of market forces rather than a reflection of the importance
which the parties have attached to performance taking place at the agreed time and on
the agreed terms. Thus a passenger may be willing to pay an ‘enhanced’ price for a
service not because of the operation of market forces but because he or she wishes to
ensure that a particular purpose is achieved (and the acceptance of the higher price by
the service provider may evidence his or her acceptance of that purpose so that it
becomes the ‘common’ purpose of the parties).
On the facts of 
Canary Wharf (BP4) T1 Ltd
 
v. 
European Medicines Agency
 
the EMA
claimed that the effect of Brexit would be to frustrate a twenty-five-year underlease into
which it had entered with the claimant in 2014. The EMA’s primary case was that, as an
agency of the EU, it could no longer lawfully occupy premises outside of the EU so that
the effect of Brexit would be to frustrate the underlease by supervening illegality. This
claim was rejected because it was found that there was no relevant supervening
illegality. The EMA’s secondary case was that the effect of Brexit was to frustrate the
common purpose of the underlease, which was that the EMA would occupy the premises
as its permanent headquarters through to 2039. Marcus Smith J held (at [244]–[245])
that the parties had no such common purpose. The fact that the underlease contained
provisions permitting assignment and sub-letting of the premises in limited
circumstances was fatal to the claim that the parties’ intention was that the EMA would
occupy the premises for the entirety of the term of the underlease. Further, there was
held to be no common purpose beyond the purpose to be derived from the terms of the
underlease. Outside the terms of the underlease the purposes of the parties were held to
be ‘divergent’ rather than common because the EMA was focused on ‘bespoke premises,
with the greatest flexibility as to term, and the lowest rent’, while the claimant landlords
were focused on ‘long-term cash flow, at the highest rate’ and they were prepared to
allow the EMA to influence the configuration of the building, provided that this was not
adverse to their own interests. This being the case, the underlease was not the outcome
of the parties’ common purpose but was the product of ‘rival negotiations driven by
different
 
objectives 
([218(2)]). It was therefore an arm’s length bargain where the
parties were looking after their own interests, and the only common purpose was to be
found in the terms of the underlease. The fact that, with the benefit of hindsight, the
agreement turned out to be a poor one for the EMA (both in relation to the term of the
underlease and the restrictions on its ability to assign the underlease or sub-let the
premises) was held to be insufficient to amount to a case of frustration. It was thus held
not to be a case which was analogous to 
Krell
.
A more convincing analysis of 
Krell
 
has been provided by Professor Treitel (
Frustration
and Force Majeure
 
(3rd edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2014), para 7–014) in the following
terms:
The contract in [
Krell
] was not simply one which granted a licence to use the rooms at an unusually high price.
It was a contract to provide facilities for viewing the coronation processions or, as Lord Phillips MR has stated,
one for a ‘room with a view’. There was not, indeed, any undertaking in it that the processions would take place,
or that they could be viewed from the rooms. In this respect, the contract differed from the contract that is made
by buying a theatre or concert ticket: performance of such a contract would become impossible if supervening
events led to the cancellation of the play or concert. In 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
 
there was no such impossibility. … But it
was the common purpose of both parties that facilities for viewing the processions should be provided: in the
words of Vaughan Williams LJ, the provision of such facilities was the crucial point ‘as much for the lessor as
the hirer’. In the other examples, there was either no such common purpose … or the common purpose was not
wholly defeated. The latter point reflects a recurrent feature of the cases on frustration of purpose, which shows
that the approach of the law to partial frustration of purpose differs from that which it adopts to partial
impossibility. In cases of partial impossibility, a contract can be discharged if its 
main
 
purpose can no longer be
achieved; but in cases of frustration of purpose the courts have applied the more rigorous test of asking whether
any
 
part of the contractual purpose (other than a part which was wholly trivial) could still be achieved: if so,
they have refused to apply the doctrine of discharge. … In [the 
Herne Bay
 
case,] naval review may have formed
the hirer’s principal inducement to enter into the contract, but the continued presence of the fleet at Spithead
also provided a considerable and unusual attraction, and it was one of the purposes of the contract to give the
hirer the opportunity of taking advantage of this attraction for commercial purposes. In 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
, by
contrast, it was no part of the contractual purpose that Mr Henry should be able to look out of the window to
watch the ordinary London traffic which continued to pass down Pall Mall on the two days in question. 
Krell
 
v.
Henry
 
seems, with respect, to have been correctly decided on the basis that it was the common purpose of both
parties that facilities for watching the processions were to be provided under the contract, and the cancellation
of the processions had prevented the achievement of that common purpose (although literal performance of the
contract had not become impossible). This emphasis on the requirement that the purpose of 
both
 
parties must
be frustrated is found also in other English and American cases. It means that the supervening event must
prevent one party from supplying, and the other from obtaining, what the former had contracted to provide and
the latter to acquire under the contract. In this sense, formulations of the doctrine in terms of the frustration of
the purpose of 
both
 
parties are preferable to those (occasionally found) which refer to the frustration of the
purpose of 
one
 
party only. The point can be illustrated by supposing that, in 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
, the coronation had
taken place as planned but Mr Henry had fallen ill and so been unable to watch the processions. In that case, his
purpose might have been frustrated, but the same could not have been said of Mr Krell’s purpose: that purpose,
being the provision of viewing facilities, would have been accomplished. Accordingly it is submitted that on
such facts, the contract should not have been discharged. [Emphasis in the original.]
On this basis 
Krell
 
is a very narrow decision indeed. Provided that the focus is kept on
the purpose of both parties to the contract the decision should be kept within limits and
not become an escape route for parties looking for a way out of a bad bargain.
An alternative explanation of 
Krell
 
has been provided by Posner CJ in 
Northern Indiana
Public Service Co
 
v. 
Carbon County Coal Co
, 799 F 2d 265. He stated (at p. 277):
The leading case on frustration remains 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
 
[1903] 2 KB 740 (CA). Krell rented Henry a suite of
rooms for watching the coronation of Edward VII, but Edward came down with appendicitis and the coronation
had to be postponed. Henry refused to pay the balance of the rent and the court held that he was excused from
doing so because his purpose in renting had been frustrated by the postponement, a contingency outside the
knowledge, or power to influence, of either party. The question was, to which party did the contract (implicitly)
allocate the risk? Surely Henry had not intended to insure Krell against the possibility of the coronation’s being
postponed, since Krell could always relet the room, at the premium rental, for the coronation’s new date. So
Henry was excused.
Professor Treitel points out (para 7–012) that this rationalization of 
Krell
 
is not ‘wholly
compelling’. The ‘insurance’ argument runs into the difficulty that neither party may
have considered the possibility of insuring on the facts of the case. And the argument
that Mr Krell could always have relet the room encounters the factual difficulty that the
route of the procession which actually took place differed in some respects from the
cancelled procession. Professor Treitel also points out that the argument in relation to
the possibility of reletting the room seems to ‘involve a paradox in so far as it suggests
that Mr Krell’s claim for the balance of £50 would have been strengthened if (to imagine
the unthinkable) the coronation had been wholly cancelled because a Republic had been
declared’.
21.6
 
The Effects of Frustration
The effect of frustration is to discharge the contract automatically (
Hirji Mulji
 
v. 
Cheong
Yue Steamship Co Ltd
 
[1926] AC 497). Both parties are then released from their
obligations to perform the contract after the date of discharge without incurring any
liability for breach of contract in respect of their failure to perform these obligations.
Discharge is a drastic sanction. The parties may prefer to suspend the contract while
they wait to see what impact the event (such as a war) will have on the contract or they
may prefer to adjust the contract so that one party does not suffer undue hardship as a
result of the occurrence of the unexpected event. Parties who wish to make provision for
the suspension or adjustment of the contract should insert an appropriate clause in the
contract to that effect (a force majeure clause if suspension is the desired remedy and a
hardship clause if adjustment of the contract is the wished-for outcome).
The law of contract does not attempt to regulate the financial consequences of the
discharge of the contract on the ground of frustration. In the absence of a breach of
contract, there can be no action for damages for breach. Regulation of the financial
consequences of the frustration of a contract is a matter for the law of restitution (or, if
one prefers, the law of unjust enrichment). The law is now to be found largely in the Law
Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943. The Act has generated very little case-law.
There is, however, one notable exception and that is the litigation between BP
Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd and Mr Hunt. Although the case was appealed all the way up
to the House of Lords, the leading 
judicial exposition of the Act is to be found in the
judgment of the judge at first instance, Robert Goff J. Before examining the Act and the
case-law it is necessary to say something about the common law rules which pre-dated
the Act.
The development of the common law rules can be divided into two distinct stages. The
first stage was associated with the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Chandler
 
v.
Webster
 
[1904] 1 KB 493. 
Chandler
 
was another of the coronation cases. The principal
issue in 
Chandler
 
was the financial consequences of the frustration of the contract
between the parties. The Court of Appeal held that money paid under a contract prior to
it being frustrated could be recovered upon a total failure of consideration. But,
crucially, they held that, in order to constitute a total failure of consideration, the
contract had to be set aside 
ab initio
. Frustration does not have such a consequence. The
contract is set aside from the moment of the occurrence of the frustrating event but the
termination is not retrospective in its effect. This being the case, the party who paid the
money could not recover it because he could not demonstrate that there had been a total
failure of consideration. The loss therefore lay where it fell. A similar principle was
applicable in the case where services were performed prior to the frustration of the
contract. In 
Cutter
 
v. 
Powell
 
(1795) 6 TR 320 Mr Powell employed Mr Cutter as second
mate on a ship that was to sail from Jamaica to Liverpool. The level of pay offered by Mr
Powell was generous but the contract stated that the money was only payable after the
ship arrived in Liverpool provided that Mr Cutter had done his duty as second mate on
the journey. Mr Cutter died before the ship arrived in Liverpool. His death frustrated the
contract between the parties. His widow brought an action to recover the wages which
she alleged were due to her deceased husband in respect of the services he performed
prior to his death. Her claim failed. Mr Cutter was only entitled to payment on
completion of the voyage and, having failed to do so, he was not entitled to make any
claim for work done prior to the termination of the contract on his death.
The second stage in the development of the common law was the decision of the House
of Lords in 
Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna
 
v. 
Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd
 
[1943] AC
32. The House of Lords overruled 
Chandler
. While they affirmed that money paid was
recoverable upon a total failure of consideration, they rejected the proposition that it is
necessary to set aside the contract 
ab initio
 
in order to create such a total failure. In
order to establish a total failure of consideration the payor simply has to show that the
basis upon which he had paid the money has totally failed. An illustration of such a total
failure is provided by the facts of 
Fibrosa
 
itself. The respondents agreed to manufacture
machines for the appellants and to deliver them to Gdynia in Poland but, before delivery
could be effected, the contract was frustrated when Poland was occupied by the German
army. The House of Lords held that the appellants were entitled to recover their
prepayment of £1,000 on the ground that it had been paid for a consideration which had
wholly failed. The money had been paid for machinery and they had not received any
part of the machinery as a result of the outbreak of war. Not having received any part of
the performance for which they had contracted, they were entitled to recover their
money as on a total failure of consideration.
While 
Fibrosa
 
was an improvement upon 
Chandler
 
it still left the law in an
1.—
(2)
unsatisfactory state. First, money paid was only recoverable upon a 
total
 
failure of
consideration. Had the appellants in 
Fibrosa
 
received any part of the performance for
which they had contracted they would not have been entitled to recover their
prepayment. Secondly, the law did little to protect the interest of the recipient of the
money. It is likely that the respondents in 
Fibrosa
 
had acted to their detriment in
manufacturing the machinery for the appellants but any such detrimental reliance did
not give the respondents a claim against the appellants nor did it entitle them to set-off
their expenditure against the appellants’ claim to recover the 
prepayment they had
made. Thirdly, 
Fibrosa
 
did nothing to improve the position of the party who has
performed services prior to the frustration of the contract. The House of Lords was only
dealing with money claims and did not purport to deal with the case where the benefit
conferred on the other party took a form other than the payment of money.
Prior to 
Fibrosa
 
a Law Revision Committee report had been produced on the rule laid
down in 
Chandler
. While 
Fibrosa
 
solved some of the problems generated by 
Chandler
 
it
did not solve them all. Parliament therefore proceeded to enact legislation in the form of
the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943. For our purposes the principal
provisions are sections 1(2) and 1(3). Section 1(2) deals with the recovery of money,
while section 1(3) deals with recovery in respect of non-money benefits. The Act is a
short one and it is set out in full. The Act is then followed by an extract from the
judgment of Robert Goff J in 
BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd
 
v. 
Hunt (No 2)
 
[1979] 1
WLR 783. The opening part of that judgment is a very clear exposition of the central
provisions of the Act.
LAW REFORM (FRUSTRATED CONTRACTS) ACT 1943
Adjustment of rights and liabilities of parties to frustrated
contracts
(1) Where a contract governed by English law has become impossible of
performance or been otherwise frustrated, and the parties thereto have for
that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract,
the following provisions of this section shall, subject to the provisions of
section two of this Act, have effect in relation thereto.
All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before
the time when the parties were so discharged (in this Act referred to as ‘the
(3)
(a)
(b)
(4)
(5)
time of discharge’) shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from
him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums
were paid, and, in the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable:
Provided that, if the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable
incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the
performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so
having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as
the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or
payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.
Where any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any
other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract,
obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which the
last foregoing subsection applies) before the time of discharge, there shall
be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not
exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court
considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case and, in
particular,—
the amount of any expenses incurred before the time of discharge
by the benefited party in, or for the purpose of, the performance of
the contract, including any sums paid or payable by him to any other
party in pursuance of the contract and retained or recoverable by
that party under the last foregoing subsection, and
the effect, in relation to the said benefit, of the circumstances giving
rise to the frustration of the contract.
In estimating, for the purposes of the foregoing provisions of this section,
the amount of any expenses incurred by any party to the contract, the court
may, without prejudice to 
the generality of the said provisions, include such
sum as appears to be reasonable in respect of overhead expenses and in
respect of any work or services performed personally by the said party.
In considering whether any sum ought to be recovered or retained under
the foregoing provisions of this section by any party to the contract, the
court shall not take into account any sums which have, by reason of the
circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract, become payable
to that party under any contract of insurance unless there was an obligation
(6)
2.—
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
to insure imposed by an express term of the frustrated contract or by or
under any enactment.
Where any person has assumed obligations under the contract in
consideration of the conferring of a benefit by any other party to the
contract upon any other person, whether a party to the contract or not, the
court may, if in all the circumstances of the case it considers it just to do so,
treat for the purposes of subsection (3) of this section any benefit so
conferred as a benefit obtained by the person who has assumed the
obligations as aforesaid.
Provision as to application of this Act
(1) This Act shall apply to contracts, whether made before or after the
commencement of this Act, as respects which the time of discharge is on or
after the first day of July, nineteen hundred and forty-three, but not to
contracts as respects which the time of discharge is before the said date.
This Act shall apply to contracts to which the Crown is a party in like
manner as to contracts between subjects.
Where any contract to which this Act applies contains any provision which,
upon the true construction of the contract, is intended to have effect in the
event of circumstances arising which operate, or would but for the said
provision operate, to frustrate the contract, or is intended to have effect
whether such circumstances arise or not, the court shall give effect to the
said provision and shall only give effect to the foregoing section of this Act
to such extent, if any, as appears to the court to be consistent with the said
provision.
Where it appears to the court that a part of any contract to which this Act
applies can properly be severed from the remainder of the contract, being a
part wholly performed before the time of discharge, or so performed except
for the payment in respect of that part of the contract of sums which are or
can be ascertained under the contract, the court shall treat that part of the
contract as if it were a separate contract and had not been frustrated and
shall treat the foregoing section of this Act as only applicable to the
remainder of that contract.
This Act shall not apply—
(a)
(b)
(c)
to any charterparty, except a time charterparty or a charterparty by
way of demise, or to any contract (other than a charterparty) for the
carriage of goods by sea; or
to any contract of insurance, save as is provided by subsection (5)
of the foregoing section; or
to any contract to which section 7 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979
(which avoids contracts for the sale of specific goods which perish
before the risk has passed to the buyer) applies, or to any other
contract for the sale, or for the sale and delivery, of specific goods,
where the contract is frustrated by reason of the fact that the goods
have perished.
BP EXPLORATION CO (LIBYA) LTD V. HUNT (NO 2)
[1979] 1 WLR 783, Queen’s Bench Division
Mr Hunt was the owner of an oil concession granted by the Libyan government. He
did not have the resources to develop the concession himself, so he entered into a
joint venture with BP under which BP were to carry out the exploration and
development of the site and they also agreed to transfer to Mr Hunt certain ‘farm-
in’ contributions in cash and in oil. In return Mr Hunt agreed to grant BP a half
share of the concession and further agreed to repay, over a period of time, 125 per
cent of BP’s ‘farm-in’ contributions and his half share of the expenditure incurred in
the exploration and development of the fields. Payment was to be made in the
form of three-eighths of Mr Hunt’s share of the oil produced from the field until such
time as the reimbursement was complete. A giant oil field was discovered and the
field came on stream in 1967. Once the field came on stream it was agreed that
the costs of production would be divided equally between the parties. In 1971 BP’s
interest in the oil field was expropriated by the Libyan government and, in 1973, Mr
Hunt’s interest was also expropriated. At this point BP had received approximately
one-third of their reimbursement oil. BP claimed that the expropriation of the
interests in the oil field had frustrated the contract between the parties and that
they were entitled to the award of a ‘just sum’ under section 1(3) of the Law
Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943. The extract that follows concentrates on
(a)
(b)
(c)
the analysis of the Act itself. The application of the Act to the facts of the case will
be dealt with in the commentary that follows the extract.
Robert Goff J
(1)
 
The principle of recovery
The principle, which is common to both section 1(2) and (3), and indeed is
the fundamental principle underlying the Act itself, is prevention of the
unjust enrichment of either party to the contract at the other’s expense. …
Although section 1 (2) and (3) is concerned with restitution in respect of
different types of benefit, it is right to construe the two subsections as
flowing from the same basic principle and therefore, so far as their different
subject matters permit, to achieve consistency between them. Even so, it is
always necessary to bear in mind the difference between awards of
restitution in respect of money payments and awards where the benefit
conferred by the plaintiff does not consist of a payment of money. Money
has the peculiar character of a universal medium of exchange. By its
receipt, the recipient is inevitably benefited; and (subject to problems
arising from such matters as inflation, change of position and the time value
of money) the loss suffered by the plaintiff is generally equal to the
defendant’s gain, so that no difficulty arises concerning the amount to be
repaid. The same cannot be said of other benefits, such as goods or
services. By their nature, services cannot be restored; nor in many cases
can goods be restored, for example where they have been consumed or
transferred to another. Furthermore the identity and value of the resulting
benefit to the recipient may be debatable. From the very nature of things,
therefore, the problem of restitution in respect of such benefits is more
complex than in cases where the benefit takes the form of a money
payment; and the solution of the problem has been made no easier by the
form in which the legislature has chosen to draft section 1(3) of the Act.
The Act is not designed to do certain things: (i) It is not designed to
apportion the loss between the parties. There is no general power under
either section 1(2) or section 1(3) to make any allowance for expenses
incurred by the plaintiff (except, under the proviso to section 1(2), to enable
him to enforce pro tanto payment of a sum payable but unpaid before
(d)
frustration); and expenses incurred by the defendant are only relevant in so
far as they go to reduce the net benefit obtained by him and thereby limit
any award to the plaintiff. (ii) It is not concerned to put the parties in the
position in which they would have been if the contract had been performed.
(iii) It is not concerned to restore the parties to the position they were in
before the contract was made. A remedy designed to prevent unjust
enrichment may not achieve that result; for expenditure may be incurred by
either party under the contract which confers no benefit on the other, and in
respect of which no remedy is available under the Act.
An award under the Act may have the effect of rescuing the plaintiff from an
unprofitable bargain. This may certainly be true under section 1(2), if the
plaintiff has paid the price in advance for an expected return which, if
furnished, would have proved unprofitable; if the contract is frustrated
before any part of that expected return is received, and before any
expenditure is incurred by the defendant, the plaintiff is entitled to the return
of the price he has paid, irrespective of the consideration he would have
recovered had the contract been performed. Consistently with section 1(2),
there is nothing in section 1(3) which necessarily limits an award to the
contract consideration. But the contract consideration may nevertheless be
highly relevant to the assessment of the just sum to be awarded under
section 1(3); this is a matter to which I will revert later in this judgment.
(2)
 
Claims under section 1(2)
Where an award is made under section 1(2), it is, generally speaking, simply an
award for the repayment of money which has been paid to the defendant in
pursuance of the contract, subject to an allowance in respect of expenses incurred
by the defendant. It is not necessary that the consideration for the payment should
have wholly failed: claims under section 1(2) are not limited to cases of total failure
of consideration, and cases of partial failure of consideration can be catered for by
a cross-claim by the defendant under section 1(2) or section 1(3) or both. There is
no discretion in the court in respect of a claim under section 1(2), except in respect
of the allowance for expenses; subject to such an allowance (and, of course, a
cross-claim) the plaintiff is entitled to repayment of the money he has paid. The
allowance for expenses is probably best rationalised as a statutory recognition of
the defence of change of position. True, the expenses need not have been
(a)
incurred by reason of the plaintiff’s payment; but they must have been incurred in,
or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract under which the plaintiff’s
payment has been made, and for that reason it is just that they should be brought
into account. No provision is made in the subsection for any increase in the sum
recoverable by the plaintiff, or in the amount of expenses to be allowed to the
defendant, to allow for the time value of money. The money may have been paid,
or the expenses incurred, many years before the date of frustration; but the cause
of action accrues on that date, and the sum recoverable under the Act as at that
date can be no greater than the sum actually paid, though the defendant may have
had the use of the money over many years, and indeed may have profited from its
use. Of course, the question whether the court may award interest from the date of
the accrual of the cause of action is an entirely different matter. …
(3)
 
Claims under section 1(3)
General. In contrast, where an award is made under section 1(3), the
process is more complicated. First, it has to be shown that the defendant
has, by reason of something done by the plaintiff in, or for the purpose of,
the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a
payment of money) before the time of discharge. That benefit has to be
identified, and valued, and such value forms the upper limit of the award.
Secondly, the court may award to the plaintiff such sum, not greater than
the value of such benefit, as it considers just having regard to all the
circumstances of the case, including in particular the matters specified in
section 1(3)(a) and (b). In the case of an award under section 1(3) there
are, therefore, two distinct stages—the identification and valuation of the
benefit, and the award of the just sum. The amount to be awarded is the
just sum, unless the defendant’s benefit is less, in which event the award
will be limited to the amount of that benefit. The distinction between the
identification and valuation of the defendant’s benefit, and the assessment
of the just sum, is the most controversial part of the Act. It represents the
solution adopted by the legislature of the problem of restitution in cases
where the benefit does not consist of a payment of money; but the solution
so adopted has been criticised by some commentators as productive of
injustice, and it certainly gives rise to considerable problems, to which I
shall refer in due course.
(b)
Identification of the defendant’s benefit. In the course of the argument
before me, there was much dispute whether, in the case of services, the
benefit should be identified as the services themselves, or as the end
product of the services. One example canvassed (because it bore some
relationship to the facts of the present case) was the example of
prospecting for minerals. If minerals are discovered, should the benefit be
regarded … simply as the services of prospecting, or … as the minerals
themselves being the end product of the successful exercise? Now, I am
satisfied that it was the intention of the legislature, to be derived from
section 1(3) as a matter of construction, that the benefit should in an
appropriate case be identified as the end product of the services. This
appears, in my judgment, not only from the fact that section 1(3)
distinguishes between the plaintiff’s performance and the defendant’s
benefit, but also from section 1(3)(b) which clearly relates to the product of
the plaintiff’s performance. Let me take the example of a building contract.
Suppose that a contract for work on a building is frustrated by a fire which
destroys the building and which, therefore, also destroys a substantial
amount of work already done by the plaintiff. Although it might be thought
just to award the plaintiff a sum assessed on a quantum meruit basis,
probably a rateable part of the contract price, in respect of the work he has
done, the effect of section 1(3)(b) will be to reduce the award to nil,
because of the effect, in relation to the defendant’s benefit, of the
circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract. It is quite plain
that, in section 1(3)(b), the word ‘benefit’ is intended to refer, in the example
I have given, to the actual improvement to the building, because that is
what will be affected by the frustrating event; the subsection therefore
contemplates that, in such a case, the benefit is the end product of the
plaintiff’s services, not the services themselves. This will not be so in every
case, since in some cases the services will have no end product; for
example, where the services consist of doing such work as surveying, or
transporting goods. In each case, it is necessary to ask the question: what
benefit has the defendant obtained by reason of the plaintiff’s contractual
performance? But it must not be forgotten that in section 1(3) the relevance
of the value of the benefit is to fix a ceiling to the award. If, for example, in a
building contract, the building is only partially completed, the value of 
the
partially completed building (i.e. the product of the services) will fix a ceiling
(c)
(d)
for the award; the stage of the work may be such that the uncompleted
building may be worth less than the value of the work and materials that
have gone into it, particularly as completion by another builder may cost
more than completion by the original builder would have cost. In other
cases, however, the actual benefit to the defendant may be considerably
more than the appropriate or just sum to be awarded to the plaintiff, in
which event the value of the benefit will not in fact determine the quantum
of the award. I should add, however, that, in a case of prospecting, it would
usually be wrong to identify the discovered mineral as the benefit. In such a
case there is always (whether the prospecting is successful or not) the
benefit of the prospecting itself, i.e. of knowing whether or not the land
contains any deposit of the relevant minerals; if the prospecting is
successful, the benefit may include also the enhanced value of the land by
reason of the discovery; if the prospector’s contractual task goes beyond
discovery and includes development and production, the benefit will include
the further enhancement of the land by reason of the installation of the
facilities, and also the benefit of in part transforming a valuable mineral
deposit into a marketable commodity.
I add by way of footnote that all these difficulties would have been avoided
if the legislature had thought it right to treat the services themselves as the
benefit. In the opinion of many commentators, it would be more just to do
so; after all, the services in question have been requested by the
defendant, who normally takes the risk that they may prove worthless, from
whatever cause. In the example I have given of the building destroyed by
fire, there is much to be said for the view that the builder should be paid for
the work he has done, unless he has (for example by agreeing to insure the
works) taken upon himself the risk of destruction by fire. But my task is to
construe the Act as it stands. On the true construction of the Act, it is in my
judgment clear that the defendant’s benefit must, in an appropriate case, be
identified as the end product of the plaintiff’s services, despite the difficulties
which this construction creates, difficulties which are met again when one
comes to value the benefit.
Apportioning the benefit. In all cases, the relevant benefit must have been
obtained by the defendant by reason of something done by the plaintiff.
Accordingly, where it is appropriate to identify the benefit with an end
(e)
product and it appears that the defendant has obtained the benefit by
reason of work done both by the plaintiff and by himself, the court will have
to do its best to apportion that benefit, and to decide what proportion is
attributable to the work done by the plaintiff. That proportion will then
constitute the relevant benefit for the purposes of section 1(3) of the Act.
Valuing the benefit. Since the benefit may be identified with the product of
the plaintiff’s performance, great problems arise in the valuation of the
benefit. First, how does one solve the problem which arises from the fact
that a small service may confer an enormous benefit, and conversely, a
very substantial service may confer only a very small benefit? The answer
presumably is that at the stage of valuation of the benefit (as opposed to
assessment of the just sum) the task of the court is simply to assess the
value of the benefit to the defendant. For example, if a prospector after
some very simple prospecting discovers a large and unexpected deposit of
a valuable mineral, the benefit to the defendant (namely, the enhancement
in the value of the land) may be enormous; it must be valued as such,
always bearing in mind that the assessment of a just sum may very well
lead to a much smaller amount being awarded to the plaintiff. But
conversely, the plaintiff may have undertaken building work for a substantial
sum which is, objectively speaking, of little or no value—for example, he
may commence the redecoration, 
to the defendant’s execrable taste, of
rooms which are in good decorative order. If the contract is frustrated
before the work is complete, and the work is unaffected by the frustrating
event, it can be argued that the defendant has obtained no benefit, because
the defendant’s property has been reduced in value by the plaintiff’s work;
but the partial work must be treated as a benefit to the defendant, since he
requested it, and valued it as such. Secondly, at what point in time is the
benefit to be valued? If there is a lapse of time between the date of the
receipt of the benefit, and the date of frustration, there may in the
meanwhile be a substantial variation in the value of the benefit. If the
benefit had simply been identified as the services rendered, this problem
would not arise; the court would simply award a reasonable remuneration
for the services rendered at the time when they were rendered, the
defendant taking the risk of any subsequent depreciation and the benefit of
any subsequent appreciation in value. But that is not what the Act provides:
section 1(3)(b) makes it plain that the plaintiff is to take the risk of
depreciation or destruction by the frustrating event. If the effect of the
frustrating event upon the value of the benefit is to be measured, it must
surely be measured upon the benefit as at the date of frustration. For
example, let it be supposed that a builder does work which doubles in value
by the date of frustration, and is then so severely damaged by fire that the
contract is frustrated; the valuation of the residue must surely be made on
the basis of the value as at the date of frustration. However, does this mean
that, for the purposes of section 1(3), the benefit is always to be valued as
at the date of frustration? For example, if goods are transferred and
retained by the defendant till frustration when they have appreciated or
depreciated in value, are they to be valued as at the date of frustration?
The answer must, I think, generally speaking, be in the affirmative, for the
sake of consistency. But this raises an acute problem in relation to the time
value of money. Suppose that goods are supplied and sold, long before the
date of frustration; does the principle that a benefit is to be valued as at the
date of frustration require that allowance must be made for the use in the
meanwhile of the money obtained by the disposal of the goods, in order to
obtain a true valuation of the benefit as at the date of frustration? This was
one of the most hotly debated matters before me, for the very good reason
that in the present case it affects the valuation of the parties’ respective
benefits by many millions of dollars. It is very tempting to conclude that an
allowance should be made for the time value of money, because it appears
to lead to a more realistic valuation of the benefit as at the date of
frustration; and, as will appear hereafter, an appropriate method for making
such an allowance is available in the form of the net discounted cash flow
system of accounting. But I have come to the conclusion that, as a matter
of construction, this course is not open to me. First, the subsection limits
the award to the value of the benefit obtained by the defendant; and it does
not follow that, because the defendant has had the money over a period of
time, he has in fact derived any benefit from it. Secondly, if an allowance
was to be made for the time value of the money obtained by the defendant,
a comparable allowance should be made in respect of expenses incurred
by the defendant, i.e. in respect of the period between the date of incurring
the expenditure and the date of frustration, and section 1(3)(a) only
contemplates that the court, in making an allowance for expenses, shall
(f)
(g)
have regard to the ‘amount of [the] expenses.’ Thirdly, as I have already
indicated, no allowance for the time value of money can be made under
section 1(2); and it would be inconsistent to make such an allowance under
section 1(3) but not under section 1(2) …
Finally, I should record that the court is required to have regard to the effect,
in relation to the defendant’s benefit, of the circumstances giving rise to the
frustration of the 
contract. I have already given an example of how this may
be relevant, in the case of building contracts; and I have recorded the fact
that this provision has been the subject of criticism. There may, however, be
circumstances where it would not be just to have regard to this factor—for
example if, under a building contract, it was expressly agreed that the work
in progress should be insured by the building-owner against risks which
include the event which had the effect of frustrating the contract and
damaging or destroying the work.
Assessment of the just sum. The principle underlying the Act is prevention
of the unjust enrichment of the defendant at the plaintiff’s expense. Where,
as in cases under section 1(2), the benefit conferred on the defendant
consists of payment of a sum of money, the plaintiff’s expense and the
defendant’s enrichment are generally equal; and, subject to other relevant
factors, the award of restitution will consist simply of an order for repayment
of a like sum of money. But where the benefit does not consist of money,
then the defendant’s enrichment will rarely be equal to the plaintiff’s
expense. In such cases, where (as in the case of a benefit conferred under
a contract thereafter frustrated) the benefit has been requested by the
defendant, the basic measure of recovery in restitution is the reasonable
value of the plaintiff’s performance—in a case of services, a quantum
meruit or reasonable remuneration, and in a case of goods, a quantum
valebat or reasonable price. Such cases are to be contrasted with cases
where such a benefit has not been requested by the defendant. In the latter
class of case, recovery is rare in restitution; but if the sole basis of recovery
was that the defendant had been incontrovertibly benefited, it might be
legitimate to limit recovery to the defendant’s actual benefit—a limit which
has (perhaps inappropriately) been imported by the legislature into section
1(3) of the Act. However, under section 1(3) as it stands, if the defendant’s
actual benefit is less than the just or reasonable sum which would
(h)
otherwise be awarded to the plaintiff, the award must be reduced to a sum
equal to the amount of the defendant’s benefit.
A crucial question, upon which the Act is surprisingly silent, is this: what
bearing do the terms of the contract, under which the plaintiff has acted,
have upon the assessment of the just sum? First, the terms upon which the
work was done may serve to indicate the full scope of the work done, and
so be relevant to the sum awarded in respect of such work … Secondly, the
contract consideration is always relevant as providing some evidence of
what will be a reasonable sum to be awarded in respect of the plaintiff’s
work. … Thirdly, however, the contract consideration, or a rateable part of it,
may provide a limit to the sum to be awarded … It is unnecessary for me to
decide whether this will always be so; but it is likely that in most cases this
will impose an important limit upon the sum to be awarded—indeed it may
well be the most relevant limit to an award under section 1(3) of the Act.
The legal basis of the limit may be section 2(3) of the Act; but even if that
subsection is inapplicable, it is open to the court, in an appropriate case, to
give effect to such a limit in assessing the just sum to be awarded under
section 1(3), because in many cases it would be unjust to impose upon the
defendant an obligation to make restitution under the subsection at higher
than the contract rate.
Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeal ([1981] 1 WLR 232) on various points and
the defendants further appealed to the House of Lords ([1983] 2 AC 352). The grounds
of appeal generally concerned issues with which we are not here concerned. But there is
one passage from the judgment of Lawton LJ in the Court of Appeal which is of
considerable 
significance. Its importance lies in the fact that it casts doubt upon the
analytical approach adopted by Robert Goff J, in particular, his attempt to analyse the
Act in terms of an underlying principle of the prevention of unjust enrichment. Lawton
LJ stated (at pp. 237–238 and 241–243):
The Act of 1943 was passed shortly after the decision of the House of Lords in 
Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna
 
v.
Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd
 
[1943] AC 32, which overruled 
Chandler
 
v. 
Webster
 
[1904] 1 KB 493.
The earlier case had been regarded as authority for the proposition that, on the occurrence of an event which
frustrates the performance of a contract, the loss lies where it falls and that money paid by one party to the
contract to the other party is to be retained by the party in whose hands it is. The object of the Act was to make
the operation of the law more fair when a contract governed by English law … has become impossible of
performance and the parties to it have for that reason been discharged from further performance. This was to be
done by adjusting the rights and liabilities of the parties in the ways set out: see section 1(1). …
Before the court can make an award under [section 1(3)] it must be satisfied that one party to a contract has
obtained a valuable benefit by reason of something done by the other. In this case the plaintiffs did a great deal
for the defendant and he obtained, before the frustrating events happened, a most valuable benefit from what
they had done for him, which was so great that it was incapable of any exact valuation. This part of the problem
presented no difficulties for the judge. What was difficult was the assessment of the sum which the court
considered just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case. Save for what is mentioned in paragraphs (a)
and (b), the subsection gives no help as to how, or upon what principles, the court is to make its assessment or
as to what factors it is to take into account. The responsibility lies with the judge: he has to fix a sum which he,
not an appellate court, considers just. This word connotes the mental processes going to forming an opinion.
What is just is what the trial judge thinks is just. That being so, an appellate court is not entitled to interfere
with his decision unless it is so plainly wrong that it cannot be just. The concept of what is just is not an absolute
one. Opinions among right thinking people may, and probably will, differ as to what is just in a particular case.
No one person enjoys the faculty of infallibility as to what is just. It is with these considerations in mind that we
approach this case.
The judge assessed the just sum on what can be described as a reimbursement basis, that is to say, by
ensuring as far as was practicable that the plaintiffs got back what they had paid out on the defendant’s behalf
before the frustrating events happened …
Mr Rokison, on behalf of the plaintiffs, accepted that there could be more than one way of assessing a just
sum. He pointed out that there was nothing in the Act to indicate that its purpose was to enable the judge to
apportion losses or profits, or to put the parties in the positions which they would have been in if the contract
had been fully performed or if it had never been made. This we accept. He submitted that the concept behind
the Act was to prevent unjust enrichment. This is what the judge had thought. We get no help from the use of
words which are not in the statute. … In our judgment, this court would not be justified in setting aside the
judge’s way of assessment merely because we thought that there were better ways. Mr Rokison tried to show
that the judge’s way was wrong and palpably wrong. … In our judgment, it cannot be said that the judge went
wrong, and certainly not palpably wrong, in assessing a just sum by reference to the concept of reimbursing the
plaintiffs.
Commentary
Applying the principles he had set out to the complex facts of the case, Robert Goff J
concluded that the ‘valuable benefit’ which Mr Hunt obtained as a result of the work
done by BP before the frustration of the contract was the ‘end product’ of BP’s services.
This Robert Goff J identified with the enhancement in the value of Mr Hunt’s
concession. When valuing that benefit Robert Goff J held that section 1(3)(b) required
him to take account of the circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract
which, on the facts, had the effect of reducing the value of the benefit to the value of the
oil which Mr Hunt had actually obtained from the oil field and the financial settlement
which he had reached with the Libyan government. In assessing the ‘just sum’ BP were
awarded the costs and expenses which they had incurred on Mr Hunt’s account plus the
‘farm-in’ contributions in cash and oil received by Mr Hunt less the reimbursement oil
which BP had received. In essence, the just sum was the reasonable value of the services
rendered and goods supplied by BP with counter-restitution being made for the value of
the oil received by BP.
Leaving to one side the complex facts of the case, three principal issues arise out of 
BP
 
v.
Hunt
 
and the interpretation placed by the judges upon the provisions of the 1943 Act.
The first relates to the principle which underpins the Act. Robert Goff J stated that the
principle was the prevention of unjust enrichment, whereas Lawton LJ stated,
somewhat dismissively, that the court derived ‘no help from the use of words which are
not in the statute’. This leaves the basis of the Act obscure. The analysis of Robert Goff J
does, however, seem to be the preferable one. The Act is not designed to provide a
flexible machinery for the adjustment of losses. Unlike legislation subsequently enacted
in other parts of the Commonwealth, the 1943 Act does not empower the court to
apportion losses between parties to the contract. While the Act does confer a discretion
upon the court, it is not a discretion that relates explicitly to the apportionment of
losses. In all cases the court must first identify the benefit which the defendant has
obtained at the expense of the claimant. The discretion given to the court relates only to
the proportion of that benefit which is recoverable by the claimant. It is a discretion
exercisable within a framework which seeks to prevent the unjust enrichment of one
party at the expense of the other.
The second point relates to the scope of section 1(2). This subsection was not directly in
issue on the facts of 
BP
 
v. 
Hunt
 
but it was nevertheless analysed in some detail by
Robert Goff J. Section 1(2) differs from 
Fibrosa
 
in two principal respects. First, the
entitlement of the payor to recover the money paid is not confined to cases in which
there has been a total failure of consideration. Money paid is recoverable even upon a
partial failure of consideration. Secondly, the proviso to section 1(2) gives to the court a
discretion to allow the payee to retain some or all of the prepayment that has been
made. Robert Goff J rationalized the proviso as a statutory recognition of the defence of
change of position. A rather different approach was, however, taken by Garland J in
Gamerco SA
 
v. 
ICM/Fair Warning (Agency) Ltd
 
[1995] 1 WLR 1226. A contract to
promote a rock concert was held to have been frustrated when the permit to hold the
concert at a sports stadium in Madrid was suddenly withdrawn because of safety fears

about the stadium. The plaintiff promoters had paid the defendant group the sum of
$412,500 prior to the frustration of the contract and both parties had incurred
expenditure in preparing for the concert. Garland J held that the plaintiffs were entitled
to the return of the prepayment which they had made under section 
1(2) of the Act and
that no deduction should be made under the proviso to that subsection. The plaintiffs
were therefore entitled to recover the $412,500. In so concluding Garland J stated (at
pp. 1236–1237):
Various views have been advanced as to how the court should exercise its discretion and these can be
categorised as follows:
Total retention
. This view was advanced by the Law Revision Committee in 1939 (Cmnd 6009) on the
questionable ground ‘that it is reasonable to assume that in stipulating for pre-payment the payee
intended to protect himself from loss under the contract’. As the editor of 
Chitty on Contracts
, 27th edn,
(1994) vol 1., 1141, para 23–060, note 15 (Mr EG McKendrick) comments: ‘He probably intends to
protect himself against the possibility of the other party’s insolvency or default in payment’. To this, one
can add: ‘and secure his own cash flow’.
[He then considered two passages from the judgment of Robert Goff J in 
BP
 
v. 
Hunt
 
set out at pp. 717–718,
earlier in the section, and continued]
I do not derive any specific assistance from the 
BP Exploration
 
case. There was no question of any change of
position as a result of the plaintiffs’ advance payment.
Equal division
. This was discussed by Professor Treitel in 
Frustration and Force Majeure
 
pp. 555–556
at paras 15–059 and 15–060 of his book. There is some attraction in splitting the loss but what if the
losses are very unequal? Professor Treitel considers statutory provisions in Canada and Australia but
makes the point that equal division is unnecessarily rigid and was rejected by the Law Revision
Commission in the 1939 report to which reference has already been made. The parties may, he suggests,
have had unequal means of providing against the loss by insurers, but he appears to overlook sub-
section (5). It may well be that one party’s expenses are entirely thrown away while the other is left with
some realisable or otherwise usable benefit or advantage. Their losses may, as in the present case, be
very unequal. Professor Treitel therefore favours the third view.
Broad discretion
. It is self-evident that any rigid rule is liable to produce injustice. The words, ‘if it
considers it just so to do in all the circumstances of the case’ clearly confer a very broad discretion.
Obviously the court must not take into account anything which is not ‘a circumstance of the case’ or fail
to take into account anything that is and then exercise its discretion rationally. I see no indication in the
Act, the authorities, or the relevant literature that the court is obliged to incline either towards total
retention or equal division. Its task is to do justice in a situation which the parties neither contemplated
nor provided for, and to mitigate the possible harshness of allowing all loss to lie where it has fallen.
I have not found my task easy. As I have made clear, I would have welcomed assistance on the true measure of
the defendants’ loss and the proper treatment of overhead and non-specific expenditure. Because the
defendants have plainly suffered some loss, I have made a robust assumption. In all the circumstances, and
having particular regard to the plaintiffs’ loss, I consider that justice is done by making no deduction under the
proviso.
We can see here the same approach as that adopted by the Court of Appeal in 
BP
 
v.
Hunt
, namely an emphasis on the discretion of the court and a refusal to confine that
discretion by seeking to articulate the principles upon which the exercise of the
discretion is based. One point which does, however, emerge with some clarity from
Gamerco
 
relates 
to the location of the onus of proof. Garland J stated that the onus of
proof was on the defendant. The significance of this can be seen from the case of 
Lobb
 
v.
Vasey Housing Auxiliary
 
[1963] VR 239. The defendants were paid £1,250 by Mrs
Smith for an exclusive licence to occupy a flat in a block of flats which they were
building. Mrs Smith died before her flat was completed. The defendants refused to
return the £1,250. Mrs Smith’s executrix sued to recover it. It was held that the death of
Mrs Smith frustrated the contract between the parties and that the onus of proof was on
the defendants to show that it was just in all the circumstances of the case for them to
retain any part of the prepayment. They were unable to do this. The trial judge stated
that in the typical case one would expect the defendants to sell the right to occupy the
flat to someone else and to recover their expenses in that way.
The third point relates to the construction of section 1(3). The most important point
here is Robert Goff J’s interpretation of ‘valuable benefit’. He concluded that, in ‘an
appropriate case’, the benefit is to be identified with the ‘end product’ of the claimant’s
services and not with the services themselves. This has unfortunate consequences where
the effect of the frustrating event is to destroy the work of the claimant. In such a case
there is no end product and so nothing to value. An example is provided by the old case
of 
Appleby
 
v. 
Myers
 
(1867) LR 2 CP 651. The plaintiffs contracted to make and erect
machinery in the defendant’s factory and to maintain the machinery for a period of two
years. After part of the machinery had been erected, an accidental fire destroyed the
factory and the machinery and so frustrated the contract. It was held that the plaintiffs
were not entitled to recover any payment in respect of the work done prior to the
frustration of the contract. The same result would appear to follow under section 1(3).
The result is an unfortunate one but here it must be recalled that the Act does not seek
to engage in loss apportionment as such. A claimant can only recover where the
defendant has received a benefit as a result of the work he has done and the
consequence of identifying the benefit with the end product of the work is to narrow the
concept of benefit that underpins the Act so that reliance expenditure which does not
result in an end product will not be recoverable under section 1(3). An example of this is
provided by 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
(
21.1
) itself. The claim brought by the plaintiffs was one
to recover the expenses they had incurred in advertising the concerts. It is unlikely that
such expenditure would generate a claim under the Act because it does not result in a
valuable benefit to the defendant.
A three-stage approach must be taken to any claim brought under section 1(3). First, the
benefit itself must be identified. The benefit will generally be the goods or, in the case of
the provision of services, the end product of these services. Secondly, the benefit must
be valued. Thirdly, the court must decide what is a ‘just sum’ on the facts of the case. The
‘just sum’ cannot exceed the value of the benefit conferred. In 
BP
 
v. 
Hunt
 
Robert Goff J
took a similar approach to that taken in a restitutionary claim and held that the just sum
was, essentially, the reasonable value of the services rendered. But the Court of Appeal
chose to place emphasis instead on the discretion of the judge at first instance. Thus
Lawton LJ stated that ‘what is just is what the trial judge thinks is just’ and that an
appellate court is not entitled to interfere with the finding of the just sum by the trial
judge unless it is ‘so plainly wrong that it cannot be just’. On this view the trial judge has
a substantial measure of discretion and it is extremely difficult to predict what will
constitute a ‘just sum’ in any case involving the provision of services prior to the
frustration of the contract. In this respect it is perhaps fortunate that a frustrated
contract is a comparative rarity in commercial practice. This being the case, the Act
rarely comes into play and so the deficiencies in the Act and in the reasoning of the
Court of Appeal in 
BP
 
v. 
Hunt
 
rarely come to light.
21.7
 
The Basis of Frustration
What is the basis of the doctrine of frustration? Given that the courts do not have the
power at common law to set aside a term on the basis that it is unreasonable, on what
basis can the courts claim to be entitled to set aside an entire contract on the ground
that the circumstances have turned out to be radically different from those which the
parties had in mind when they entered into the contract? Perhaps surprisingly, these
questions do not appear to have troubled the courts. The doctrine of frustration is well
established, albeit that its exact juridical basis remains uncertain. The different possible
bases for the doctrine of frustration were, however, discussed by the House of Lords in
National Carriers Ltd
 
v. 
Panalpina (Northern) Ltd
 
[1981] AC 675, alongside the
question of whether or not a lease can be frustrated. While the House of Lords decided
in clear terms that a lease could, in principle, be frustrated, they were less clear as to the
basis of the doctrine of frustration.
NATIONAL CARRIERS LTD V. PANALPINA (NORTHERN)
LTD
[1981] AC 675, House of Lords
National Carriers, the respondents, owned a warehouse on English Street,
Kingston-upon-Hull. By an agreement dated 12 July 1974 they leased the
warehouse to Panalpina, the appellants, for a ten-year term. Panalpina used the
warehouse for the commercial storage of goods. They agreed not to use the
warehouse other than for this purpose without the consent of National Carriers.
The only vehicular access to the warehouse was by Kingston Street. On 16 May
1979 the Kingston-upon-Hull City Council closed Kingston Street to allow the
demolition of a derelict building nearby. Kingston Street was closed for 20 months.
During this time Panalpina could not use the warehouse and stopped paying rent
to National Carriers. National Carriers brought an action for unpaid rent. In its
defence Panalpina claimed that the lease had been frustrated by the closure of
Kingston Street. The judge held that he was bound by authority to decide that a
lease could not be the subject of frustration. The House of Lords held that the
doctrine of frustration was in principle applicable to leases (Lord Russell 
dubitante
)
but that, on the facts, the lease in this case had not been frustrated.
Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC
The doctrine of frustration is of comparatively recent development …
It is generally accepted that the doctrine of frustration has its roots in the
decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench given by Blackburn J in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
(1863) 3 B & S 826 …
At least five theories of the basis of the doctrine of frustration have been put
forward at various times, and, since the theoretical basis of the doctrine is clearly
relevant to the point under discussion, I enumerate them here. The first is the
‘implied term’ or ‘implied condition’ theory on which Blackburn J plainly relied in
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
, as applying to the facts of the case before him. To these it is
admirably suited. The weakness, it seems to me, of the implied term theory is that
it raises once more the spectral figure of the officious bystander intruding on the
parties at the moment of agreement. In the present case, had the officious
bystander pointed out to the parties in July 1974 the danger of carrying on the
business of a commercial warehouse opposite a listed building of doubtful stability
and asked them what they would do in the event of a temporary closure of
Kingston Street pending a public local inquiry into a proposal for demolition after
the lease had been running for over five years, I have not the 
least idea what they
would have said, or whether either would have entered into the lease at all. In
Embiricos
 
v. 
Sydney Reid & Co
 
[1914] 3 KB 45, 54 Scrutton J appears to make the
estimate of what constitutes a frustrating event something to be ascertained only at
the time when the parties to a contract are called on to make up their minds, and
this I would think to be right, both as to the inconclusiveness of hindsight which
Scrutton J had primarily in mind and as to the inappropriateness of the intrusion of
an officious bystander immediately prior to the conclusion of the agreement.
Counsel for the respondent sought to argue that 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
, 3 B & S
826, could as easily have been decided on the basis of a total failure of
consideration. This is the second of the five theories. But 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
was
clearly not so decided, and in any event many, if not most, cases of frustration
which have followed 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
have occurred during the currency of a
contract partly executed on both sides, when no question of total failure of
consideration can possibly arise.
In 
Hirji Mulji
 
v. 
Cheong Yue Steamship Co Ltd
 
[1926] AC 497, 510 Lord Sumner
seems to have formulated the doctrine as a ‘ … device [sic], by which the rules as
to absolute contracts are reconciled with a special exception which justice
demands’ and Lord Wright in 
Denny, Mott & Dickson Ltd
 
v. 
James B Fraser & Co
Ltd
 
[1944] AC 265, 275 seems to prefer this formulation to the implied condition
view. The weakness of the formulation, however, if the implied condition theory,
with which Lord Sumner coupled it, be rejected, is that, though it admirably
expresses the purpose of the doctrine, it does not provide it with any theoretical
basis at all.
Hirji Mulji
 
v. 
Cheong Yue Steamship Co Ltd
 
is, it seems to me, really an
example of the more sophisticated theory of ‘frustration of the adventure’ or
‘foundation of the contract’ formulation, said to have originated with 
Jackson
 
v.
Union Marine Insurance Co Ltd
 
(1874) LR 10 CP 125, compare also, for example,
per Goddard J in 
W J Tatem Ltd
 
v. 
Gamboa
 
[1939] 1 KB 132, 138. This, of course,
leaves open the question of what is, in any given case, the foundation of the
contract or what is ‘fundamental’ to it, or what is the ‘adventure’. Another theory, of
which the parent may have been Earl Loreburn in 
F A Tamplin Steamship Co Ltd
 
v.
Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co Ltd
 
[1916] 2 AC 397 is that the doctrine is
based on the answer to the question: ‘What in fact is the true meaning of the
contract?’: see p. 404. This is the ‘construction theory’. In 
Davis Contractors Ltd
 
v.
Fareham Urban District Council
 
[1956] AC 696, 729 Lord Radcliffe put the matter
thus, and it is the formulation I personally prefer:
‘ … frustration occurs whenever the law recognises that without default of either party a contractual
obligation has become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which performance
is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract.
Non haec in foedera veni
. It was not this that I promised to do.’
Incidentally, it may be partly because I look at frustration from this point of view that
I find myself so much in agreement with my noble and learned friends that the
appellants here have failed to raise any triable issue as to frustration by the purely
temporary, though prolonged, and in 1979 indefinite, interruption, then expected to
last about a year, in the access to the demised premises. In all fairness, however, I
must say that my approach to the question involves me in the view that whether a
supervening event is a frustrating event or not is, in a wide variety of cases, a
question of degree, and therefore to some extent at least of fact, whereas in your
Lordships’ House in 
Tsakiroglou & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Noblee Thorl GmbH
 
[1962] AC 93 the
question is treated as one at least involving a question of law, or, at best, a
question of mixed law and fact …
This discussion brings me to the central point at issue in this case which, in my
view, is whether or not there is anything in the nature of an executed lease which
prevents the doctrine of frustration, however formulated, applying to the subsisting
relationship between the 
parties. That the point is open in this House is clear from
the difference of opinion expressed in 
Cricklewood Property and Investment Trust
Ltd
 
v. 
Leighton’s Investment Trust Ltd
 
[1945] AC 221 between the second Lord
Russell of Killowen and Lord Goddard on the one hand, who answered the
question affirmatively, and Viscount Simon LC and Lord Wright on the other, who
answered it negatively, with Lord Porter reserving his opinion until the point arose
definitively for consideration. The point, though one of principle, is a narrow one. It
is the difference immortalised in HMS Pinafore between ‘never’ and ‘hardly ever’,
since both Viscount Simon and Lord Wright clearly conceded that, though they
thought the doctrine applicable in principle to leases, the cases in which it could
properly be applied must be extremely rare.
With the view of Viscount Simon and Lord Wright I respectfully agree. … I
conclude that the matter is not decided by authority and that the question is open
to your Lordships to decide on principle. In my view your Lordships ought now so
to decide it. Is there anything in principle which ought to prevent a lease from ever
being frustrated? I think there is not …
In the result, I come down on the side of the ‘hardly ever’ school of thought. No
doubt the circumstances in which the doctrine can apply to leases are, to quote
Viscount Simon LC in the 
Cricklewood
 
case, at p. 231, ‘exceedingly rare’. Lord
Wright appears to have thought the same, whilst adhering to the view that there
are cases in which frustration can apply, at p. 241. But, as he said in the same
passage: ‘ … the doctrine of frustration is modern and flexible and is not subject to
being constricted by an arbitrary formula’. To this school of thought I respectfully
adhere.
Lord Wilberforce
Various theories have been expressed as to [the] justification [for the doctrine of
frustration] in law: as a device by which the rules as to absolute contracts are
reconciled with a special exception which justice demands, as an implied term, as
a matter of construction of the contract, as related to removal of the foundation of
the contract, as a total failure of consideration. It is not necessary to attempt
selection of any one of these as the true basis: my own view would be that they
shade into one another and that a choice between them is a choice of what is most
appropriate to the particular contract under consideration … the doctrine can now
be stated generally as part of the law of contract; as all judicially evolved doctrines
it is, and ought to be, flexible and capable of new applications.
In my opinion … though such cases may be rare, the doctrine of frustration is
capable of application to leases of land. It must be so applied with proper regard to
the fact that a lease, that is, a grant of a legal estate, is involved. The court must
consider whether any term is to be implied which would determine the lease in the
event which has happened and/or ascertain the foundation of the agreement and
decide whether this still exists in the light of the terms of the lease, the surrounding
circumstances and any special rules which apply to leases or to the particular
lease in question.
Lord Simon of Glaisdale
A number of theories have been advanced to clothe the doctrine of frustration in
juristic respectability, the two most in favour being the ‘implied term theory’ (which
was potent in the development of the doctrine and which still provides a
satisfactory explanation of many cases) and the ‘theory of a radical change in
obligation’ or ‘construction theory’ (which appears to be the one most generally
accepted today). … My noble and learned friends who have preceded me have
enumerated the various theories … Of all the theories put forward the only one, I
think, incompatible with the application of the doctrine to a lease is that which
explains it as based on a total failure of consideration. Though such may be a
feature of some cases of frustration, it is plainly inadequate as an exhaustive
explanation: there are many cases of frustration where the contract has been
partly executed …
I can for myself see nothing about the fact of creation of an estate or interest in
land which repels the doctrine of frustration. … A fully executed contract cannot be
frustrated; and a sale of land is characteristically such a contract. But a lease is
partly executory: rights and obligations remain outstanding on both sides
throughout its currency. Even a partly executed contract is susceptible of
frustration in so far as it remains executory: there are many such cases in the
books. … My conclusion on the first issue is therefore that the doctrine of
frustration is in principle applicable to leases.
Lord Roskill
My Lords, I do not find it necessary to examine in detail the jurisprudential
foundation upon which the doctrine of frustration supposedly rests. At least five
theories have been advanced at different times. … At one time without doubt the
implied term theory found most favour, and there is high authority in its support.
But weighty judicial opinion has since moved away from that view. What is
sometimes called the construction theory has found greater favour. But my Lords,
if I may respectfully say so, I think the most satisfactory explanation of the doctrine
is that given by Lord Radcliffe in 
Davis Contractors
 
v. 
Fareham UDC
 
[1956] AC
696, 728. There must have been by reason of some supervening event some such
fundamental change of circumstances as to enable the court to say—‘this was not
the bargain which these parties made and their bargain must be treated as at an
end’—a view which Lord Radcliffe himself tersely summarised in a quotation of five
words from the Aeneid ‘
non haec in foedera veni
’. Since in such a case the crucial
question must be answered as one of law—see the decision of your Lordships’
House in 
Tsakiroglou & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Noblee Thorl GmbH
 
[1962] AC 93—by reference
to the particular contract which the parties made and to the particular facts of the
case in question, there is, I venture to think, little difference between Lord
Radcliffe’s view and the so-called construction theory.
Lord Russell of Killowen
 
concurred in the result but expressed his doubts about
the application of the doctrine of frustration to leases.
Commentary
Does the debate as to the jurisprudential basis of the doctrine of frustration matter?
Probably not a great deal. The issue is put as follows in H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on
Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021), para 26–018 (footnotes omitted):
It is … difficult to discern any practical consequence which flows from the different tests because, as Lord
Wilberforce has stated, they appear to shade into each other. The courts have regard to the construction of the
contract, the effect of the changed circumstances on the parties’ contractual obligations, the intentions of the
parties (objectively construed) and the demands of justice in deciding whether or not a contract has been
frustrated. No one factor is conclusive: the court will balance these different factors in determining whether a
contract has been frustrated. On the other hand, it must be conceded that the basis of the doctrine is not
unimportant in jurisprudential terms. A test based on a fictitious or artificial assumption (such as the implied
term approach) may prevent a proper understanding of the function of 
the doctrine and of the role of the court
in applying it. And the literal application of one theory might lead to results which are incompatible with the
rules which presently make up the doctrine of frustration. For example, the implied term theory, literally
applied, may suggest that the question whether a contract is frustrated is one of fact, based on the intention of
the parties, but it is clear law that the question whether a contract has been frustrated is one of law. It is,
however, unlikely that a modern court would apply a theory where it led to a result which was incompatible with
the present rules and so it is submitted that no practical consequences flow from the debate as to the correct
conceptual basis of the doctrine of frustration.
The statement that it is unlikely that practical consequences flow from the debate as to
the correct conceptual basis of the doctrine plainly does not tell us what is the correct
conceptual basis. It could be a concern for the fairness of the bargain made by the
parties: in this sense it could be said that the courts are struggling to strike a balance
between a concern for the fairness of the bargain made by the parties and the desire to
hold people to the terms of their contract. On the other hand, it could be said that the
courts are primarily engaged in an interpretative exercise; that is to say they are
endeavouring to ascertain whether or not the parties have made provision for the event
which has occurred and, if they have not, to determine whether performance of the
bargain according to its terms in the changed circumstances would be something
radically different from the obligations which the parties had originally assumed under
their contract.
From a comparative perspective, one of the most striking features of the doctrine of
frustration in English law is the narrow scope within which it operates. There are two
points here. First, the doctrine is rarely invoked and, secondly, where it is applicable, its
effect is to discharge the contract. The courts are not given a power to adjust the
contract to meet the changed circumstances; they must either uphold the contract
according to its terms or set it aside. Parties who wish to adjust their contract must
insert an express term in the contract to this effect. In other legal systems the courts do
have broader powers to intervene and to adjust the contract. As far as English law is
concerned, it is for the parties to protect themselves against the consequences of an
improvident bargain by inserting an appropriately drafted force majeure clause or
hardship clause into the contract: they cannot rely on the courts to act as their saviour.
It can be argued that this approach unnecessarily increases the transaction costs of the
parties because it compels them to incur the cost of drawing up an appropriate clause.
On the other hand, the diversity and sophistication of the various force majeure and
hardship clauses currently in use demonstrates that these are complex issues and it can
be said with some justification that they are best dealt with by the parties and not by the
courts. Further, a cost of giving a power to the court to adjust contracts in a wider range
of circumstances is that it will generate uncertainty. The current English position may
be harsh on a party who has entered into a bad bargain, but it has the merit of being
clear. Once again we can see the tension between the demands of certainty and a
concern for fairness.
The narrow scope of the doctrine of frustration has been questioned by some lawyers in
the light of the current global pandemic. The 19 pandemic has had an enormous impact
on many businesses, particularly in the travel and leisure industries. Two cases have
thus far come before the English courts where the contract was one for the lease of
aeroplanes which were grounded as a consequence of the pandemic (see 
Salam Air
SAOC
 
v. 
LATAM Airlines Group plc
 
[2020] EWHC 2414 (Comm) and 
Wilmington Trust
SP Services (Dublin) Ltd
 
v. 
SpiceJet Ltd
 
[2021] EWHC 1117 (Comm)). In both cases it
was held that the contracts had not been frustrated. This was for two principal reasons.
First, the terms of the lease were held to show 
that the lessees had assumed the risk of
the unavailability of the aircraft and had accepted an extremely broad obligation to
continue to make payment notwithstanding their inability to use the aircraft. Second,
the duration of the leases was between six and 10 years and the unavailability of the
aircraft for approximately 18 months of that period was held to be insufficient to
frustrate the leases. Other jurisdictions have responded more flexibly to the pandemic
by utilizing doctrines such as a hardship doctrine or a doctrine of commercial
impracticability in order to adapt contracts to the changing circumstances (see generally
Klaus Peter Berger and Daniel Behn ‘Force Majeure and Hardship in the Age of Corona:
A Historical and Comparative Study’ (2019–2020) 6 
McGill Journal of Dispute
Resolution
 
78). As we have noted, English law has not gone down this route. If parties
wish to incorporate a hardship clause into their contract (on which see 
12.3.9
), they are
free do so and the courts should give effect to such clauses. But in the absence of such a
clause, a court has no power to adapt the contract to changing circumstances, even a
change of circumstances as extreme and unprecedented as the current pandemic. It may
be that the pandemic will cause English law to reconsider the scope of the doctrine of
1.
frustration (although that reconsideration could only be carried out, in an appropriate
case, by the Supreme Court or, more likely, by the Law Commission).
In this connection it is interesting to compare English law with the Vienna Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Principles of European
Contract Law. The Vienna Convention does not make any provision for hardship or
adjustment of the contract. Article 79 (extracted later) proved to be one of the most
controversial provisions in the Convention. Its scope is uncertain in that it is not clear
what constitutes an ‘impediment’ for the purposes of Article 79(1). Further, the effect of
force majeure is to protect a party against a liability in damages but it leaves other
remedies, such as termination, intact.
Both the Principles of European Contract Law (later in this section) and the Unidroit
Principles make provision for hardship as well as force majeure. Two comments can be
made here. First, it may not always be a straightforward matter to decide whether a
particular case falls within the hardship/change of circumstances provisions or whether
it falls within the force majeure/excuse provisions. Secondly, the hardship/change of
circumstances provisions are likely to generate some uncertainty. The commentary to
Article 6:111 of the Principles of European Contract Law states that ‘the mechanism
reflects the modern trend towards giving the court some power to moderate the rigours
of freedom and sanctity of contract’. This may be true. But in doing so it will generate
uncertainty. In many ways we are debating what is the most appropriate default rule.
English law in principle holds the parties to their bargain and so leaves it to the parties
to make their own provision for events which may make performance more onerous.
The Principles of European Contract Law, by contrast, confer broader powers on the
court, while leaving it open to the parties to exclude these powers should they wish to do
so. Striking the most appropriate balance between these competing considerations is a
difficult matter.

A party is not liable for a failure to perform any of his obligations if he
proves that the failure was due to an impediment beyond his control and he

could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into
account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or

If the party’s failure is due to the failure by a third person whom he has
engaged to perform the whole or a part of the contract, that party is exempt
from liability only if:
he is exempt under the preceding paragraph; and
the person whom he has so engaged would be so exempt if the
provisions of that paragraph were applied to him.
The exemption provided by this article has effect for the period during which
the impediment exists.
The party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the
impediment and its effect on his ability to perform. If the notice is not
received by the other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails
to perform knew or ought to have known of the impediment, he is liable for
damages resulting from such non-receipt.
Nothing in this article prevents either party from exercising any right other
than to claim damages under this Convention.
PRINCIPLES OF EUROPEAN CONTRACT LAW
Article 6:111—Change of Circumstances
A party is bound to fulfil its obligations even if performance has become
more onerous, whether because the cost of performance has increased or
because the value of the performance it receives has diminished.
If, however, performance of the contract becomes excessively onerous
because of a change of circumstances, the parties are bound to enter into
negotiations with a view to adapting the contract or terminating it, provided
that:
the change of circumstances occurred after the time of conclusion of
the contract,

the possibility of a change of circumstances was not one which
could reasonably have been taken into account at the time of
conclusion of the contract, and
the risk of the change of circumstances is not one which, according
to the contract, the party affected should be required to bear.
If the parties fail to reach agreement within a reasonable period, the court
may:
terminate the contract at a date and on terms to be determined by
the court; or
adapt the contract in order to distribute between the parties in a just
and equitable manner the losses and gains resulting from the
change of circumstances.
In either case, the court may award damages for the loss suffered through a party
refusing to negotiate or breaking off negotiations contrary to good faith and fair
dealing.
Article 8:108—Excuse Due to an Impediment
A party’s non-performance is excused if it proves that it is due to an
impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably have been
expected to take the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion
of the contract, or to have avoided or overcome the impediment or its
consequences.
Where the impediment is only temporary the excuse provided by this article
has effect for the period during which the impediment exists. However, if the
delay amounts to a fundamental non-performance, the obligee may treat it
as such.
The non-performing party must ensure that notice of the impediment and of
its effect on its ability to perform is received by the other party within a
reasonable time after the non-performing party knew or ought to have
known of these circumstances. The other party is entitled to damages for
any loss resulting from the non-receipt of such notice.

Breach of Contract and Termination
Central Issues
A breach of contract consists of a failure, without lawful excuse, to
perform a contractual obligation. The breach can take different forms,
such as a refusal to perform, defective performance, or late
performance. Breach of contract is generally a form of strict liability;
that is to say it is not usually necessary to prove fault in order to
establish the existence of a breach.
While every breach of contract gives rise to a right to claim damages
in respect of the loss occasioned by the breach, not every breach of
contract gives to the innocent party the right to terminate the contract.
Identification of the circumstances in which a party is entitled to
terminate a contract in the event of a breach by the other party raises
difficult technical questions, but it also gives rise to some difficult
questions of policy. In the event of a breach, should the law encourage
the parties to stick together and work out their differences or should it
confer upon the parties a wide right to terminate their relationship so
as to enable them to find alternative performance elsewhere? English
law generally attaches considerable significance to the right to
terminate and it recognizes a wider right to terminate than that to be
found in many other legal systems in the world. The right to terminate,
as a matter of English law, depends in part upon the nature of the term
broken (whether or not it is a condition) but also upon the
consequences of the breach. A large part of this chapter is devoted to
the identification of the circumstances in which the law entitles a party
to terminate further performance of the contract and to the policy
issues which are at stake in these cases.
A breach of contract does not, of itself, bring a contract to an end. The
breach may give to the innocent party the right to terminate the
4.
contract but it is for the innocent party to decide whether or not to
exercise that right. The innocent party has a right of election; that is to
say he can choose either to affirm the contract or to terminate it. Once
he has made his decision, it is, in principle, irrevocable.
It is possible to breach a contract before the time for performance has
arrived. This is known as an anticipatory breach of contract. An
example is a case in which one party informs the other, 
before the time
for performance, that he will not perform his obligations under the
contract. In such a case the innocent party is not required to wait until
the time for performance to arrive (although he is entitled to do so): he
can decide immediately to terminate the contract and claim damages.
The innocent party may decide to ignore the breach, continue with
performance, and claim the contract price. The right of the innocent
party to take the latter step was recognized by the House of Lords in
White & Carter (Councils) Ltd
 
v. 
McGregor
. Both the existence and the
scope of this right are the subject of some controversy. The
controversy will be examined in the last part of this chapter.

Introduction
Breach of contract is a topic of some complexity. The complexity is both factual and
legal. It is factually complex in the sense that the existence or otherwise of a breach of
contract is often a matter of considerable dispute between the parties. In some cases
both parties allege that there has been a breach of contract (for example, the buyer
alleges that the seller is in breach of contract in selling goods which are not of
satisfactory quality, while the seller in turn alleges that the buyer is in breach of contract
in failing or refusing to pay for the goods). It is the task of the court to examine these
allegations and to ascertain who has in fact broken the contract (and in some cases it
may be that both parties are in breach of contract). Difficulties also arise from the
complexity of the legal rules themselves. Breach is a very technical area of law, where it
is necessary to proceed with caution. The need for caution is particularly apparent in the
case of commercial contracts because one false step can be extremely expensive. A
contracting party which purports to terminate a contract when it is not in fact entitled to
do so may find itself liable for damages for wrongful termination of the contract (and the
damages payable in such cases may be substantial).
The approach taken in this chapter is to proceed by asking a number of questions. These
questions are as follows:
What is a breach of contract?
When does a breach of contract give rise to a right to terminate further
performance of the contract?
Must the innocent party exercise its right to terminate further performance of the
contract?
When is the right to terminate lost?
What is an anticipatory breach of contract and what rights are generated by an
anticipatory breach?
22.2
 
What Is a Breach of Contract?
Not every failure to perform amounts to a breach of contract. Take the case of a person
who buys a theatre ticket, pays for it in advance, but does not bother to collect the ticket
or to turn up for the performance. The failure to collect the ticket or to turn up for the
performance 
does not constitute a breach of contract for the simple reason that the
purchaser of the ticket has not promised to attend the performance (unless perhaps the
purchaser is a theatre critic or a celebrity who has promised to attend the play in order
to generate some publicity). The contractual obligation is to pay for the ticket, not to
attend the performance. Thus, in order to determine whether there has been a breach of
contract it is necessary to examine the terms of the contract, both express and implied.
The breach lies in the failure, without lawful excuse, to perform a contractual obligation.
That failure may take many different forms, including the following: (i) an express
refusal to perform the contract or a particular term of the contract (for example, a buyer
of goods informs the seller that he no longer wants the goods and will not pay for them);
(ii) defective performance (for example, a seller supplies the buyer with goods that do
not work and are not of satisfactory quality or not fit for the purpose for which they were
sold); and (iii) incapacitating oneself from performing the contract (for example, the
seller of goods sells the goods which he had agreed to sell to one buyer to another buyer
so that he can no longer physically comply with his obligation to sell the goods to the
first buyer).
It is, however, important to stress that not every failure to perform a contractual
obligation amounts to a breach of contract. In some instances the law provides the party
who fails to perform his contractual obligation with an excuse for his non-performance.
Take the case of the buyer who refuses to pay for the goods which have been delivered to
him on the ground that the goods are defective. The buyer who lawfully rejects the goods
and refuses to pay for them is not in breach of contract in so acting. He has a lawful
excuse for his actions in that the prior breach of contract by the seller and his lawful
rejection of the goods discharged him from his obligation to pay for them. The law also
provides a party with a lawful excuse for non-performance where, prior to the time for
performance, the contract between the parties is frustrated (on which see 
Chapter 21
).
The effect of frustration is automatically to determine the contract between the parties
and to release them from their future obligations to perform under the terms of the
contract.
The existence of a breach of contract does not generally depend upon a finding that the
non-performing party intentionally broke the contract or was otherwise at fault. In other
words, liability for breach of contract is strict. This is not to say that liability is absolute.
As we have noted, the law does on occasion relieve a contracting party of liability for a
failure of performance that would otherwise amount to a breach of contract. But these
exceptions operate within very narrow confines. The principal exception is the doctrine
of frustration. The conclusion that liability for breach of contract is generally strict is one
that is worthy of note. At first sight it may appear rather unusual. What is the
justification for imposing liability on a party who has not been at fault? Liability based
on fault seems much easier to justify. Thus when we turn from the law of contract to the
law of tort, we find that strict liability is viewed with some suspicion by the courts
(legislative examples of the imposition of strict liability are rather more common; see for
example Part I of the Consumer Protection Act 1987) and that liability based on fault is
the norm. A similar picture can be found when we look to the law of contract in some
civilian systems where liability for breach of contract is based upon fault. The
justification for the imposition of strict liability is that a defendant who has voluntarily
assumed an obligation to perform should be required to perform that obligation. Thus a
carrier who promises to deliver goods to their intended recipient before midday on the
day after taking receipt of the goods will be liable for a failure to deliver the goods by the
stipulated time even in the case where the failure to deliver is caused by an event which
is not attributable to the fault of the carrier. The carrier who wishes to qualify his
liability should do so by the terms of his contract. Thus he could assume an obligation 
to
use ‘best endeavours’ or ‘reasonable endeavours’ to deliver the goods at the stated time,
or he could insert an exclusion clause or a force majeure clause into the contract stating
that he is not to be held liable for a failure to deliver the goods where the cause of the
failure is an event which is outside his control. It would not, however, be true to say that
the justification for the imposition of strict liability can be found in all cases in the
voluntary assumption of such a liability. In some cases the law imposes upon one
contracting party a strict obligation, irrespective of the wishes of that party. A clear
example is the term implied into contracts for the sale of goods that the goods must be
of satisfactory quality (see section 14 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, discussed in more
detail at 
10.2
, and section 9 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015). This obligation is
imposed on a seller of goods who sells in the course of a business. The effect of this
implied term is to impose liability on the seller irrespective of the wishes of the
particular seller. The justification offered in support of the imposition of liability in such
cases is the need to protect the buyer, in particular the consumer buyer who is assumed
to be in a weaker position than the seller. In any event, the seller will, in all probability,
have a claim for breach of contract against his supplier, until liability is finally chased
back to the manufacturer of the defective product.
However, it should not be assumed that liability for breach of contract is always strict. It
is not. In some cases it is necessary to establish that the defendant was at fault. An
example is provided by section 13 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 which
provides that:
[i]n a contract for the supply of a service where the supplier is acting in the course of a business, there is an
implied term that the supplier will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill.
In this instance the obligation that is imposed on the supplier is one to take reasonable
care so that it is only by demonstrating that the supplier has failed to exercise
reasonable care and skill that a breach can be established. English law recognizes the
existence of a number of obligations to exercise reasonable care. But the fact that some
obligations are confined to the exercise of reasonable care does not mean that the
general rule is one of liability based on fault. It is not. The general rule is that liability is
strict.
It should also be noted that English law has a unitary notion of breach of contract. That
is to say liability does not generally depend upon the cause of the breach of contract. In
this respect English law is much simpler than some continental systems (such as that in
Germany) which traditionally have distinguished between different forms of liability and
thus built up an elaborate classification system. In Germany liability was, until relatively
recently, based on impossibility of performance, delay, and positive breach of contract.
However, on 1 January 2002 Germany introduced a very significant reform to its law of
contract, and the effect of that reform is to bring German law much closer to the
common law model. International instruments, such as the Vienna Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (on which see 
22.3.7
), have tended to
adopt a unitary notion of breach or non-performance and these instruments may prove
to be very important in persuading other jurisdictions to adopt a unified liability system
for breach of contract.
Finally, it is important to point out that, while every breach of contract gives rise to a
remedy in damages (even if the claim is only for nominal damages; see further 
23.1
), not
every breach generates a right to terminate further performance of the contract. The
right to terminate further performance of the contract is only available in certain
circumstances 
and it is the purpose of the next section of this chapter to identify the
circumstances that trigger the right to terminate. Termination can be an extremely
important remedy (or right) in practice because it is exercised by the parties themselves.
That is to say it is not necessary to go to court and seek an order of the court before
terminating further performance of the contract. It is up to the parties to decide whether
or not to terminate. However, it is important to remember that the courts may be asked,
after the event, to decide whether or not the party who purported to terminate the
contract was in fact entitled to do so. This supervisory jurisdiction of the court assumes
considerable practical significance, especially when it is borne in mind that a party who
purports to terminate when it does not in fact have the right to terminate will be found
to have wrongfully terminated the contract and may find itself exposed to a claim for
substantial damages. It is for this reason that the lawyer must exercise great care when
advising a party whether or not it should terminate further performance of the contract.
Draftsmen often go to considerable lengths to draft a clause that gives a clear right to
terminate, although these clauses can, on occasion, give rise to difficulties of
interpretation: see, for example, 
Rice
 
v. 
Great Yarmouth District Council
 
[2003] TCLR 1
CA, discussed in more detail at 
22.3.5
. Difficult issues can also arise in ascertaining the
relationship between the right to terminate under a term of the contract and the right to
terminate which arises under the general law (see 
Stocznia Gdynia SA
 
v. 
Gearbulk
Holdings Ltd
 
[2009] EWCA Civ 75, [2009] BLR 196). It is therefore a matter of some
importance to consider the circumstances in which a breach of contract gives to the
innocent party the right to terminate further performance of the contract.
22.3
 
The Existence of a Right to Terminate
When considering whether or not a breach of contract entitles the innocent party to
terminate further performance of the contract, one of a number of different approaches
could be adopted. One approach is to leave it to the parties to decide when the right to
terminate will arise. The difficulty with this approach is that the parties may not make
their own provision for termination and so it is necessary for the law to provide a
‘default rule’ that is applicable where the parties make no provision themselves.
Alternatively, one could leave it to the unfettered discretion of the court to decide
whether or not there exists a right to terminate. The difficulty with this approach is that
it results in too much uncertainty. Parties need to know their rights before they go to
court so that they can avoid disputes or, where they do arise, settle them without
incurring the cost of going to court. So there is a need for clear rules. On the other hand,
clear rules can be inflexible and lead to injustice. There is therefore a need to strike a
balance between the interest in certainty and the need to produce fair and just solutions
when the rules are applied to individual fact situations.
English law has struggled to strike that balance in an appropriate way. But it is not
alone. Other legal systems have struggled similarly. There is no one obvious solution to
the problem. It is a policy issue and it is possible to strike the balance between certainty
and fairness in different places. Traditionally English law is located towards the
certainty end of the spectrum in that it places considerable emphasis on the need to
ensure that the parties can know where they stand in the event of a breach (see, in
particular, 
Bunge Corporation New York
 
v. 
Tradax Export SA, Panama
 
[1981] 1 WLR
711, discussed at 
22.3.4
). But at the same time there is a line of cases, usually associated
with the recognition of intermediate or innominate terms (see 
Hong Kong Fir
 
v.
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha
 
[1962] 2 QB 26, discussed at 
22.3.3
), in which greater emphasis
is placed on flexibility and fairness, so that the entitlement of the 
innocent party to
terminate depends upon the seriousness of the breach which has taken place. Thus there
is a tension at the heart of English law, in that it employs two apparently inconsistent
strategies at the same time. The first and traditional strategy is to focus on the nature of
the term broken. Thus, on this view, if the term broken is of sufficient importance, the
law will confer upon the innocent party the right to terminate further performance of
the contract, irrespective of the consequences of the breach. But where the term broken
is of minimal significance then the right to terminate will not arise. The difficulty with
this strategy is the obvious one, namely that there are many contract terms that fall into
the middle: they are neither very important, nor very trivial, so how is it to be decided
whether or not the breach of such a term gives rise to the right to terminate? The
difficulties with this strategy have led some to argue that the focus of the law should be
upon the consequences of the breach, rather than the nature of the term broken. This is
the second strategy and it finds expression in the cases in which the courts have
classified the term which has been broken as an innominate term so that the entitlement
to terminate depends upon the consequences of the breach. The result of the adoption of
this strategy is, it is said, to produce fairer outcomes to cases in that judges and
arbitrators can then tailor the remedy to meet the facts of the case. But flexibility carries
with it a price and that price is uncertainty in that it becomes more difficult for parties to
predict the likely outcome of litigation with the result that it may become more difficult
to resolve disputes.
In this section consideration will be given to the circumstances in which a breach of
contract gives a right to the innocent party to terminate further performance of the
contract. A right to terminate will generally arise where the term broken is a condition
but not where the term broken is a warranty. Where the term broken is intermediate, or
innominate, the right to terminate will depend upon the consequences of the breach.
Where the consequences are serious then a right to terminate will arise. Conversely,
where the consequences of the breach are not serious, a right to terminate will not arise
and the innocent party will be confined to a remedy in damages. This section is therefore
broken down into a number of distinct parts. Section 
22.3.1
 
considers the right to
terminate in the event of a breach of a condition. Section 
22.3.2
, which is extremely
brief, notes that there is no right to terminate in the event of a breach of a warranty.
Section 
22.3.3
 
is devoted to intermediate terms, while 
22.3.4
 
explores the problems that
can arise in deciding whether a term which has not been classified by the parties is a
condition, a warranty, or an intermediate term. Section 
22.3.5
 
examines termination
clauses, while 
22.3.6
 
considers the significance, if any, to be attached to the good faith of
the party who is alleged to have repudiated the contract. Section 
22.3.7
 
brings this
section to a close with a brief comparative discussion, in which English law will be
compared with the Vienna Convention and with the Principles of European Contract
Law.
22.3.1
 
Breach of a Condition
It is trite law that breach of a ‘condition’ of the contract gives to the innocent party a
right to terminate further performance of the contract. The difficulty lies in discerning
whether or not a particular term amounts to a condition. As Professor Treitel has stated
(‘“Conditions” and “Conditions Precedent”’ (1990) 106 
LQR
 
185), ‘one of the most
notorious sources of difficulty in the law of contract is the variety of senses in which it
uses the expression “condition”’. In the first place the word ‘condition’ is used in
different senses by the commercial community. A common example is provided by
standard terms of trade which are used by businesses up and down the country. These
terms are often headed ‘terms and conditions of 
business’, but it is clear in this context
that not all the terms contained in the document are ‘conditions’ in the sense that a
breach automatically generates a right to terminate further performance of the contract.
In other contexts the meaning of the word ‘condition’ is not so clear and it can give rise
to difficulties of interpretation (see, for example, 
L Schuler AG
 
v. 
Wickman Machine
Tool Sales Ltd
 
[1974] AC 235, discussed later in this section). Secondly, the word
‘condition’ has been used by the law in different senses and indeed its meaning has
changed over time. Conditions may be either contingent or promissory. A contingent
condition refers to an event that neither party has promised to bring about and upon
which hinges the obligation to perform. Suppose that A promises to pay B £100 on 30
January 2020 provided that they are both still alive at that date. Neither party promises
to stay alive until that date but their continued survival is a condition precedent to the
entitlement of B to the £100. Contingent conditions may be either conditions precedent
or subsequent. The example given is of a condition precedent. By changing the facts
slightly we can create a condition subsequent. Suppose that A promises to pay B £100
per year until either of them dies. In this case death is an event that operates to bring an
end to the obligation to make the payment. Again, neither party has promised not to die.
Death is simply the event upon which the obligation to pay comes to an end. A
promissory condition, on the other hand, is a reference to an event which one party has
promised to bring about or not to bring about, as the case may be.
Our difficulties do not end here. As Professor Treitel points out ((1990) 106 
LQR
 
185),
‘even the concept of promissory condition is used in two senses. … The first relates to the
order
 
of performance, while the second relates to the 
conformity
 
of the performance
rendered with that promised’ (emphasis in the original). It relates to the order of
performance where the obligation of one party to perform is dependent upon prior
performance by the other party of a particular obligation. So, for example, a builder may
enter into a contract with a householder to carry out some building work. Payment is to
be made on completion of the work. Completion of the work is a condition precedent to
the obligation of the householder to pay for the work. The condition is a promissory one
because the builder has promised to carry out the work and it is a condition that relates
to an event, namely the completion of performance by the builder. But suppose that the
builder completes the work defectively. In such a case the builder may have breached a
promissory condition of the contract but here the condition relates not to the order of
performance but to the quality of that performance.
The most important distinction for our purposes is between a promissory condition and
a contingent condition. In this chapter we are concerned with promissory conditions.
More precisely, our focus is upon conditions which relate to conformity rather than to
the order of performance. Nevertheless, it is not easy to maintain the latter distinction,
especially when reading nineteenth-century case-law where the judges used the phrase
‘condition precedent’ to refer both to the order of performance and to the conformity of
that performance with the terms of the contract (see, for example, 
Bentsen
 
v. 
Taylor
Sons & Co
 
[1893] 2 QB 274, 281). Where the condition relates to the order of
performance and the condition has not been fulfilled, the party whose performance is
dependent upon the fulfilment of the condition is entitled to withhold performance until
such time as the condition is fulfilled, but the failure does not necessarily entitle him to
bring the contract between the parties to an end. Where, however, the condition relates
to the conformity of performance, and the condition has been broken, the innocent
party is entitled to bring the contract between the parties to an end. So important
remedial consequences can turn on the distinction between a condition precedent which
relates to the order of performance and a condition precedent which relates to
conformity of performance. The dual usage of ‘condition precedent’ creates unnecessary
difficulties and, as Professor Treitel points out ((1990) 106 
LQR
 
185, 186), our
difficulties would be reduced if we reserved the phrase ‘condition precedent’ for use
when discussing the order of performance or the event which gives rise to the obligation
to perform and used the word condition to denote the term itself or the content of the
obligation that has been assumed. In the remainder of this part we shall be concerned
with conditions only in so far as they relate to the conformity of performance with the
terms of the contract.
Not every term of a contract is a condition in this sense. A term may be classified as a
condition in one of three ways, namely (i) by Parliament, (ii) by the courts, or (iii) by the
contracting parties themselves. There are relatively few examples of classification of
terms by Parliament. A rare example is provided by the Sale of Goods Act 1979 which
classifies a number of terms implied into contracts of sale. The terms that the seller has
a right to sell the goods, that the goods must correspond with description, that the goods
must be of satisfactory quality, reasonably fit for their purpose and correspond with
sample are all classified as conditions (Sale of Goods Act 1979, sections 12(5A), 13(2),
14(6), and 15(3), on which see 
10.2
). The consequence of this is that any breach of one of
these obligations by a seller gives to a buyer a right to reject the goods. The right of the
buyer to reject the goods has, however, been qualified by section 15A(1) of the Sale of
Goods Act 1979, which provides that where the buyer would, apart from this subsection,
have the right to reject goods by reason of a breach on the part of a seller of a term
implied by sections 13–15 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, but the breach is so slight that it
would be unreasonable for him to reject them, then the breach is not to be treated as a
breach of a condition but may be treated as a breach of a warranty. The aim of this
provision is to stop buyers rejecting goods for what may be termed ‘technical’ reasons.
An infamous example of this is provided by the case of 
Arcos Ltd
 
v. 
E A Ronaasen and
Son
 
[1933] AC 470. The parties entered into a contract for the sale of timber staves cut
to a thickness of 1/2 inch. The purchasers alleged the sellers had breached the contract
as the staves were of the wrong thickness, being 9/16 of an inch thick. The House of
Lords held that the purchasers were entitled to reject the timber. Lord Atkin stated (at p.
479) that:
[i]f the written contract specifies conditions of weight, measurement and the like, those conditions must be
complied with. A ton does not mean about a ton, or a yard about a yard. Still less when you descend to minute
measurements does 1/2 inch mean about 1/2 inch. If the seller wants a margin he must and in my experience
does stipulate for it.
The buyers were held to be entitled to reject the timber notwithstanding the fact that
their motive for trying to get out of the contract was that it had turned out to be a bad
bargain for them as a result of a fall in the market price of timber. The House of Lords
were aware of the reasons for the buyers’ wish to get out of the contract but were of the
view that they were irrelevant. Thus Lord Atkin stated (at pp. 479–480):
No doubt there may be microscopic deviations which business men and therefore lawyers will ignore. … It will
be found that most of the cases that admit any deviation from the contract are cases where there has been an
excess or deficiency in quantity which the Court has considered negligible. But apart from this consideration the
right view is that the conditions of the contract must be strictly performed. If a condition is not performed the
buyer has a right to reject. I do not myself think that there is any difference between business men and lawyers
on this matter. No doubt, in business, men often find it unnecessary or inexpedient to insist on their strict legal
rights. In a normal market if they get something substantially like 
the specified goods they may take them with
or without grumbling and a claim for an allowance. But in a falling market I find that buyers are often as eager
to insist on their legal rights as courts of law are ready to maintain them. No doubt at all times sellers are
prepared to take a liberal view as to the rigidity of their own obligations, and possibly buyers who in turn are
sellers may also dislike too much precision. But buyers are not, as far as my experience goes, inclined to think
that the rights defined in the code are in excess of business needs.
Section 15A marks a distinct shift in philosophy because it restricts the right of buyers to
reject the goods and, to this extent, will curtail the ability of buyers to ‘insist on their
strict legal rights’ in a ‘falling market’. But section 15A is hedged around by the
requirement that the consequences of the breach must be ‘slight’, that it must be
‘unreasonable’ for the buyer to reject the goods, and it is also open to the parties to
contract out of the subsection (see section 15A(2)) so that the buyer’s right to reject is
not constrained in this way.
Classification by the courts is rather more difficult. The basis on which the courts decide
whether a term, which has not been classified by Parliament or by the parties, is a
condition, a warranty, or an intermediate term is discussed at 
22.3.4
 
after we have
considered the law relating to warranties and intermediate terms.
The easiest way to create a condition is for the parties themselves to agree that a
particular term is to be classified as a condition. There is no finite list of conditions in
English law. It is open to the parties to classify as a condition a term which would not
otherwise be so classified (that is to say the courts would not conclude that the term was
a condition in the absence of express agreement to this effect by the parties). On one
view, this ability to classify as a condition a clause which would not otherwise constitute
a condition can generate unreasonable results, in the sense that a trivial breach of
contract may confer upon the innocent party a right to terminate further performance of
the contract. It is therefore necessary for contracting parties to make clear that it was
their intention to classify the term as a condition. This is not as easy as it sounds given
that the word ‘condition’ is used in different senses in the law. An example of the
problems that can arise is provided by the following case:
L SCHULER AG V. WICKMAN MACHINE TOOL SALES
LTD
(a)
(b)
(i)
(ii)
[1974] AC 235, House of Lords
The facts of the case are set out in the speech of Lord Reid.
Lord Reid
My Lords, the appellants are a German company which manufactures machine
tools and other engineering products. The respondents are a selling organization.
On May 1, 1963, they entered into an elaborate ‘distributorship agreement’ under
which the appellants (whom I shall call Schuler) granted to the respondents (called
Sales in the agreement but whom I shall call Wickman) the sole right to sell
Schuler products in territory which included the United Kingdom. These products
included ‘
panel presses
’ defined in clause 2 and general products. The panel
presses are large machine tools used by motor manufacturers. Wickman were to
act as agents for Schuler in selling the panel presses but were to purchase and re-
sell the general products.
Wickman’s obligation with regard to the promotion of sales of Schuler products
is contained in clauses 7 and 12(b) which are in the following terms:
‘7. Promotion by Sales
Subject to Clause 17 Sales will use its best endeavours to promote and extend the sale of
Schuler products in the Territory.
It shall be condition of this Agreement that:
Sales shall send its representatives to visit the six firms whose names are listed in the
Schedule hereto at least once in every week for the purpose of soliciting orders for panel
presses;
that the same representative shall visit each firm on each occasion unless there are
unavoidable reasons preventing the visit being made by that representative in which case
the visit shall be made by an alternate representative and Sales will ensure that such a
visit is always made by the same alternate representative.
Sales agrees to inform Schuler of the names of the representatives and alternate representatives
instructed to make the visits required by this Clause.
12(b) Sales undertakes, at its expense, to look after Schuler’s interest carefully and will visit Schuler
customers regularly, particularly those customers principally in the motor car and electrical industries
whose names are set out on the list attached hereto and initialled by the parties hereto and will give all
possible technical advice to customers.’
The six firms referred to in clause 7 are six of the largest motor manufacturers in
this country. The agreement was to last until the end of 1967 so that clause 7(b)(i)
(a)
(i)
(ii)
(b)
required Wickman to make a total of some 1400 visits during the period of the
agreement. Wickman failed in their obligation. At first there were fairly extensive
failures to make these visits. Then there were negotiations with a view to improving
the position and Schuler have been held to have waived any right arising out of
those failures. Thereafter there was an improvement but there were still a
considerable number of failures.
After some correspondence Schuler wrote to Wickman in October, 1964,
terminating the agreement on the ground that failure to fulfil their obligation for
weekly visits to the six firms entitled Schuler to treat that failure as a repudiation of
the agreement by Wickman. In accordance with clause 19 of the agreement this
question was referred to arbitration. In spite of the apparently simple and limited
nature of the question in dispute, proceedings before the arbitrator were elaborate
and protracted. Ultimately the arbitrator issued his award in the form of a special
case on Oct. 6, 1969. He held that Schuler were not entitled to terminate the
agreement. This finding was reversed by Mr Justice Mocatta but restored by the
Court of Appeal.
In order to explain the contention of the parties, I must now set out clause 11 of
the agreement.
‘11. Duration of Agreement
This Agreement and the rights granted hereunder to Sales shall commence on the First day of
May 1963 and shall continue in force (unless previously determined as hereinafter provided) until
the 31st day of December 1967 and thereafter unless and until determined by either party upon
giving to the other not less than 12 months’ notice in writing to that effect expiring on the said 31st
day of December 1967 or any subsequent anniversary thereof PROVIDED that Schuler or Sales
may by notice in writing to the other determine this Agreement forthwith if:
the other shall have committed a material breach of its obligations hereunder and shall
have failed to remedy the same within 60 days of being required in writing so to do or
the other shall cease to carry on business or shall enter into liquidation (other than a
Members’ voluntary liquidation for the purposes of reconstruction or amalgamation) or
shall suffer the appointment of a Receiver of the whole or a material part of its
undertaking; and PROVIDED FURTHER that Schuler may by notice determine this
Agreement forthwith if Sales shall cease to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wickman
Limited.
The termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to any rights or liabilities accrued
due prior to the date of termination and the terms contained herein as to discount commission or
otherwise will apply to any orders placed by Sales with Schuler and accepted by Schuler before
such termination.’
Wickman’s main contention is that Schuler were only entitled to determine the
agreement for the reasons and in the manner provided in clause 11. Schuler, on
the other hand, contend that the terms of clause 7 are decisive in their favour: they
say that ‘It shall be a condition of this agreement’ in clause 7(b) means that any
breach of clause 7(b)(i) or 7(b)(ii) entitles them forthwith to terminate the
agreement. So as there were admittedly breaches of clause 7(b)(i) which were not
waived they were entitled to terminate the contract.
I think it right first to consider the meaning of clause 11 because, if Wickman’s
contention with regard to this is right, then clause 7 must be construed in light of
the provisions of clause 11. Clause 11 expressly provides that the agreement ‘shall
continue in force (unless previously determined as hereinafter provided) until’ Dec.
31, 1967. That appears to imply the corollary that the agreement shall not be
determined before that date in any other way than as provided in clause 11. It is
argued for Schuler that those words cannot have been intended to have that
implication. In the first place Schuler say that anticipatory breach cannot be
brought within the scope of clause 11 and the parties cannot have intended to
exclude any remedy for an anticipatory breach. And, secondly, they say that clause
11 fails to provide any remedy for an irremediable breach however fundamental
such breach might be.
There is much force in this criticism. But on any view the interrelation and
consequences of the various provisions of this agreement are so ill-thought out
that I am not disposed to discard the natural meaning of the words which I have
quoted merely because giving to them their natural meaning implies that the
draftsman has forgotten something which a better draftsman would have
remembered. If the terms of clause 11 are wide enough to apply to breaches of
clause 7 then I am inclined to hold that clause 7 must be read subject to the
provisions of clause 11.
It appears to me that clause 11(a)(i) is intended to apply to all material
breaches of the agreement which are capable of being remedied. The question
then is what is meant in this context by the word ‘remedy’. It could mean obviate or
nullify the effect of a breach so that any damage already done is in some way
made good. Or it could mean cure so that matters are put right for the future. I
think that the latter is the more natural meaning. The word is commonly used in
connection with diseases or ailments and they would normally be said to be
remedied if they were cured although no cure can remove the past effect or result
of the disease before the cure took place. And in general it can only be in a rare
case that any remedy of something that has gone wrong in the performance of a
continuing positive obligation will, in addition to putting it right for the future,
remove or nullify damage already incurred before the remedy was applied. To
restrict the meaning of remedy to cases where all damage past and future can be
put right would leave hardly any scope at all for this clause. On the other hand,
there are cases where it would seem a misuse of language to say that a breach
can be 
remedied. For example, a breach of clause 14 by disclosure of confidential
information could not be said to be remedied by a promise not to do it again.
So the question is whether a breach of Wickman’s obligation under clause 7(b)
(i) is capable of being remedied within the meaning of this agreement. On the one
hand, failure to make one particular visit might have irremediable consequences,
e.g., a valuable order might have been lost when making that visit would have
obtained it. But looking at the position broadly I incline to the view that breaches of
this obligation should be held to be capable of remedy within the meaning of
clause 7. Each firm had to be visited more than 200 times. If one visit is missed I
think that one would normally say that making arrangements to prevent a
recurrence of that breach would remedy the breach. If that is right and if clause 11
is intended to have general application then clause 7 must be read so that a
breach of clause 7(b)(i) does not give to Schuler a right to rescind but only to
require the breach to be remedied within 60 days under clause 11(a)(i). I do not
feel at all confident that this is the true view but I would adopt it unless the
provisions of clause 7 point strongly in the opposite direction, so I turn to clause 7.
Clause 7 begins with the general requirement that Wickman shall ‘use its best
endeavours’ to promote sales of Schuler products. Then there is in clause 7(b)(i)
specification of those best endeavours with regard to panel presses, and in clause
12(b) a much more general statement of what Wickman must do with regard to
other Schuler products. This intention to impose a stricter obligation with regard to
panel presses is borne out by the use of the word ‘condition’ in clause 7(b). I
cannot accept Wickman’s argument that condition here merely means term. It must
be intended to emphasize the importance of the obligations in sub-clauses (b)(i)
and (b)(ii). But what is the extent of that emphasis?
Schuler maintains that the word ‘condition’ has now acquired a precise legal
meaning; that, particularly since the enactment of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, its
recognised meaning in English law is a term of a contract any breach of which by
one party gives to the other party an immediate right to rescind the whole contract.
Undoubtedly the word is frequently used in that sense. There may, indeed, be
some presumption that in a formal legal document it has that meaning. But it is
frequently used with a less stringent meaning. One is familiar with printed
‘Conditions of Sale’ incorporated into a contract, and with the words ‘For conditions
see back’ printed on a ticket. There it simply means that the ‘conditions’ are terms
of the contract.
In the ordinary use of the English language ‘condition’ has many meanings,
some of which have nothing to do with agreements. In connection with an
agreement it may mean a pre-condition: something which must happen or be done
before the agreement can take effect. Or it may mean some state of affairs which
must continue to exist if the agreement is to remain in force. The legal meaning on
which Schuler relies is, I think, one which would not occur to a layman; a condition
in that sense is not something which has an automatic effect. It is a term the
breach of which by one party gives to the other an option either to terminate the
contract or to let the contract proceed and, if he so desires, sue for damages for
the breach.
Sometimes a breach of a term gives that option to the aggrieved party because
it is of a fundamental character going to the root of the contract, sometimes it gives
that option because the parties have chosen to stipulate that it shall have that
effect. Mr Justice Blackburn said in 
Bettini
 
v. 
Gye
 
(1875) 1 QB 183, at p. 187:
‘Parties may think some matter, apparently of very little importance, essential; and
if they sufficiently express an intention to make the literal fulfilment of such a thing
a condition precedent, it will be one … ’
In the present case it is not contended that Wickman’s failures to make visits
amounted in themselves to fundamental breaches. What is contended is that the
terms of clause 7 ‘sufficiently express an intention’ to make any breach, however
small, of the obligation to make 
visits a condition so that any such breach shall
entitle Schuler to rescind the whole contract if they so desire.
Schuler maintains that the use of the word ‘condition’ is in itself enough to
establish this intention. No doubt some words used by lawyers do have a rigid
inflexible meaning. But we must remember that we are seeking to discover
intention as disclosed by the contract as a whole. Use of the word ‘condition’ is an
indication—even a strong indication—of such an intention but it is by no means
conclusive.
The fact that a particular construction leads to a very unreasonable result must
be a relevant consideration. The more unreasonable the result the more unlikely it
is that the parties can have intended it, and if they do intend it the more necessary
it is that they shall make that intention abundantly clear.
Clause 7(b) requires that over a long period each of the six firms shall be
visited every week by one or other of two named representatives. It makes no
provision for Wickman being entitled to substitute others even on the death or
retirement of one of the named representatives. Even if one could imply some right
to do this, it makes no provision for both representatives being ill during a
particular week and it makes no provision for the possibility that one or other of the
firms may tell Wickman that they cannot receive Wickman’s representative during
a particular week. So if the parties gave any thought to the matter at all they must
have realized the probability that in a few cases out of the 1400 required visits a
visit as stipulated would be impossible. But if Schuler’s contention is right failure to
make even one visit entitles them to terminate the contract however blameless
Wickman might be. This is so unreasonable that it must make me search for some
other possible meaning of the contract. If none can be found then Wickman must
suffer the consequences. But only if that is the only possible interpretation.
If I have to construe clause 7 standing by itself then I do find difficulty in
reaching any other interpretation. But if clause 7 must be read with clause 11 the
difficulty disappears. The word ‘condition’ would make any breach of clause 7(b),
however excusable, a material breach. That would then entitle Schuler to give
notice under clause 11(a)(i) requiring the breach to be remedied. There would be
no point in giving such a notice if Wickman were clearly not in fault but if it were
given Wickman would have no difficulty in showing that the breach had been
remedied. If Wickman were at fault then on receiving such a notice they would
have to amend their system so that they could show that the breach had been
remedied. If they did not do that within the period of the notice then Schuler would
be entitled to rescind.
In my view, that is a possible and reasonable construction of the contract and I
would therefore adopt it. The contract is so obscure that I can have no confidence
that this is its true meaning but for the reasons which I have given I think that it is
the preferable construction. It follows that Schuler was not entitled to rescind the
contract as it purported to do. So I would dismiss this appeal.
Lord Wilberforce
[dissenting]
The second legal issue which arises I would state in this way: whether it is
open to the parties to a contract, not being a contract for the sale of goods, to use
the word ‘condition’ to introduce a term, breach of which 
ipso facto
 
entitles the
other party to treat the contract as at an end.
The proposition that this may be done has not been uncriticized. It is said that
this is contrary to modern trends which focus interest rather upon the nature of the
breach, allowing 
the innocent party to rescind or repudiate whenever the breach is
fundamental, whether the clause breached is called a condition or not: that the
affixing of the label ‘condition’ cannot pre-empt the right of the Court to estimate for
itself the character of the breach. Alternatively it is said that the result contended
for can only be achieved if the consequences of a breach of a ‘condition’ (sc., that
the other party may rescind) are spelt out in the contract. …
My Lords, this approach has something to commend it: it has academic
support. The use as a promissory term of ‘condition’ is artificial, as is that of
‘warranty’ in some contexts. But in my opinion this use is now too deeply
embedded in English law to be uprooted by anything less than a complete revision
…
The alternative argument, in my opinion, is equally precluded by authority. It is
not necessary for parties to a contract, when stipulating a condition, to spell out the
consequences of breach: these are inherent in the (assumedly deliberate) use of
the word. …
It is upon this legal basis, as to which I venture to think that your Lordships are
agreed, that this contract must be construed. Does clause 7(b) amount to a
‘condition’ or a ‘term’? (to call it an important or material term adds, with all respect,
nothing but some intellectual assuagement). My Lords, I am clear in my own mind
that it is a condition, but your Lordships take the contrary view. On a matter of
construction of a particular document, to develop the reasons for a minority opinion
serves no purpose. … I would only add that, for my part, to call the clause arbitrary,
capricious or fantastic, or to introduce as a test of its validity the ubiquitous
reasonable man (I do not know whether he is English or German) is to assume,
contrary to the evidence, that both parties to this contract adopted a standard of
easygoing tolerance rather than one of aggressive, insistent punctuality and
efficiency. This is not an assumption I am prepared to make, nor do I think myself
entitled to impose the former standard upon the parties if their words indicate, as
they plainly do, the latter. I note finally, that the result of treating the clause, so
careful and specific in its requirements, as a term is, in effect, to deprive the
appellants of any remedy in respect of admitted and by no means minimal
breaches. The arbitrator’s finding that these breaches were not ‘material’ was not,
in my opinion, justified in law in the face of the parties’ own characterization of
them in their document: indeed the fact that he was able to do so, and so leave the
appellants without remedy, argues strongly that the legal basis of his finding—that
clause 7(b) was merely a term—is unsound.
I would allow this appeal.

Commentary
It is of the utmost importance to pay careful attention to the details of clauses 7, 11, and
12(b). One of the problems with this case is that the contract was badly drafted and the
majority used this fact in order to support their construction of the contract. Badly
drafted contracts are not an unknown phenomenon. The particular problem which arose
on the facts of this case was the relationship between clauses 7 and 11. First, let us
examine the clauses separately.
Clause 7(b), standing alone, does appear to create a condition. It is expressly so
described. None of their Lordships doubted that the parties were entitled, by the use of
clear words, to elevate clause 7(b) to the status of a condition. Thus Lord Kilbrandon
stated (at p. 271) that ‘it is undoubted that parties may, if they so desire, make any term
whatever, unimportant 
as it might seem to be to an observer relying upon 
a priori
reasoning of his own, a condition giving entitlement, on its breach, to rescission at the
instance of the party aggrieved’. Clause 7(b) seems clear enough in this respect. Thus,
had there been no clause 11 in the contract, it is suggested that it is likely that Schuler
would have been entitled to terminate the contract pursuant to clause 7(b).
Clause 11, on the other hand, did not confer an immediate right to terminate. Rather, it
required Schuler to give notice to Wickman and then gave Wickman a period of time in
which to remedy the breach. This is a common form of clause found in commercial
contracts as it strikes a balance between the competing interests of the parties by giving
the defaulting party an opportunity to make good his breach but at the same time it
protects the position of the innocent party by giving him an express right to terminate
the contract in the event that the breach is not made good.
The problem in this case is that the events which happened appeared to fall within both
clauses 7(b) and 11 but the remedial consequences appeared to differ depending upon
which clause was held to govern the facts of the case. If clause 7(b) prevailed then
Schuler appeared to be entitled to terminate immediately, while if clause 11 prevailed
then Schuler’s right to terminate could only be exercised after the expiry of the notice
period without the breach being remedied. What, then, was the relationship between the
two clauses? As Lord Reid stated, the inter-relationship between them was ‘ill-thought
out’.
Two issues arose here. The first was whether or not the events fell within the scope of
clause 11 at all. There was a good argument to the effect that they did not. The breach by
Wickman was a matter of past historical fact and it can be argued that it could not be
‘remedied’ as required by clause 11. Clauses such as clause 11 are relatively
straightforward where the breach takes the form of delivery of defective goods. In such a
case the breach can be remedied by the delivery of goods which conform with the terms
of the contract. But it is, at first sight, not altogether easy to see how a breach of clause
7(b) could be ‘remedied’. One cannot wind the clock back and make the missed visit.
Lord Reid, however, looked at the position ‘broadly’ and concluded that the breach
could be remedied by making arrangements to prevent a recurrence of the breach. When
considering whether or not a breach is remediable, English law adopts a practical
approach (
Force India Formula One Team Ltd
 
v. 
Etihad Airways PJSC
 
[2010] EWCA
Civ 1051, [2011] ETMR 10), albeit the construction adopted was a rather benevolent one,
at least as far as Wickman was concerned.
This led on to the second issue which was that, given that the events did appear to fall
within the scope of both clauses, what remedial consequences flowed from this? Lord
Reid concluded that breach of clause 7(b) did not confer upon Schuler an immediate
right to terminate the contract, irrespective of the consequences of the breach. Rather, a
breach of clause 7(b) was automatically a material breach for the purposes of clause 11
and thus gave to Schuler the right to invoke the machinery of clause 11. In this way,
clause 7(b) did not become redundant. Its role was to assist in the definition of a
material breach for the purposes of clause 11 and not to confer upon Schuler an
immediate right of termination.
In many ways Wickman were rather fortunate. The key fact appears to be that the
contract was badly drafted and the majority gave to Wickman the benefit of the doubt
that arose in relation to the meaning of the word ‘condition’ in clause 7(b). There is
considerable force in Lord Wilberforce’s observation that the majority construction
assumed, contrary to the evidence, that the parties had ‘adopted a standard of easygoing
tolerance rather than one of aggressive, insistent punctuality and efficiency’.
The effect of the decision was to leave Schuler exposed to a claim for damages by
Wickman because they were held to have wrongfully terminated the contract between
the parties. 
While Schuler would have a claim against Wickman for the losses that they
suffered as a result of Wickman’s failure to make the scheduled visits, it is unlikely that
such a claim would provide them with much consolation because of the probable
difficulty in proving that they had suffered any loss as a result of Wickman’s failure to
make a particular visit. Does this not suggest that the intention of Schuler was in fact to
give themselves a right to terminate the contract in order to avoid these problems of
proving that they had suffered loss as a result of the breach?
It is important to see this case in its context. It is not authority for the proposition that
the word ‘condition’ cannot mean a condition in the sense that a breach of it gives rise to
a right to terminate. The conclusion of the House of Lords was influenced heavily by the
fact that the contract was badly drafted and by the difficulties caused by the relationship
between clauses 7 and 11. The word ‘condition’ in a well-drafted contract should
generally suffice to demonstrate that what is intended is that a breach of the clause
should give rise to the right to terminate. An alternative is to avoid the use of the word

‘condition’ and use the phrase ‘of the essence’ instead. The efficacy of this phrase is
demonstrated by the following case:
LOMBARD NORTH CENTRAL PLC V. BUTTERWORTH
[1987] QB 527, Court of Appeal
The plaintiff finance company leased a computer to the defendant for a period of
five years. The contract stipulated, in clause 2(a), that time was of the essence
with regard to payment of the quarterly rentals. Clause 5 stated that failure to make
due and punctual payment entitled the plaintiffs to terminate the contract, while
clause 6 provided that, on termination, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover all
arrears of instalments and all future instalments that would have fallen due had the
agreement not been terminated. The defendant quickly fell into arrears and, after
giving due notice, the plaintiffs repossessed the computers. The plaintiffs brought
an action against the defendant in order to recover the arrears as at the date of the
termination and also the future instalments payable under the contract. The claim
was brought both under clause 6 of the contract and for damages at common law.
The Court of Appeal held that clause 6 was unenforceable as a penalty clause but
that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the arrears and the future instalments as
damages at common law following upon the defendant’s repudiatory breach of
contract.
Mustill LJ
The hiring agreement contained the following material provisions:
‘The lessee … agrees:
 
to pay to the lessor: (i) punctually and without previous demand the rentals set out in Part 3 of
the Schedule together with value added tax thereon punctual payment of each which shall be of
the essence of this lease: …

the rentals or of any sum of money payable to the lessor hereunder or any part thereof … then
upon the happening of such event … the lessor’s consent to the lessee’s possession of the
goods shall determine forthwith without any notice being given by the lessor, and the lessor may
terminate this lease either by notice in writing, or by taking possession of the goods …
In the event that the lessor’s consent to the lessee’s possession of the goods shall be determined
under clause 5 hereof (a) the lessee shall pay forthwith to the lessor (i) all arrears of rentals; (ii)

value added tax as shall be legally payable thereon; (b) the lessor shall be entitled to exercise
any one or more of the rights and remedies provided for in clause 5 and sub-clause (a) of this
clause and the determination of the lessor’s consent to the lessee’s possession of the goods
shall not affect or prejudice such rights and remedies and the lessee shall be and remain liable to

possession of the goods and/or exercised one or more of the rights and remedies of the lessor;
(c) any right or remedy to which the lessor is or may become entitled under this lease or in
consequence of the lessee’s conduct may be enforced from time to time separately or
concurrently with any other right or remedy given by this lease or now or hereinafter provided for

others of them but are cumulative.’ …
Three issues were canvassed before us …
[He set out the first two issues and continued]
Does the provision in clause 2(a) of the agreement that time for payment of the instalments was
of the essence have the effect of making the defendant’s late payment of the outstanding
instalments a repudiatory breach? …
I would, however, wish to deal with the third point. … The reason why I am impelled to hold that the
plaintiffs’ contentions are well-founded can most conveniently be set out in a series of propositions.
Where a breach goes to the root of the contract, the injured party may elect to put an end to the
contract. Thereupon both sides are relieved from those obligations which remain unperformed.
If he does so elect, the injured party is entitled to compensation for (a) any breaches which
occurred before the contract was terminated and (b) the loss of his opportunity to receive
performance of the promisor’s outstanding obligations.
Certain categories of obligation, often called conditions, have the property that any breach of
them is treated as going to the root of the contract. Upon the occurrence of any breach of
condition, the injured party can elect to terminate and claim damages, whatever the gravity of the
breach.
It is possible by express provision in the contract to make a term a condition, even if it would not
be so in the absence of such a provision.
A stipulation that time is of the essence, in relation to a particular contractual term, denotes that
timely performance is a condition of the contract. The consequence is that delay in performance
is treated as going to the root of the contract, without regard to the magnitude of the breach.
It follows that where a promisor fails to give timely performance of an obligation in respect of
which time is expressly stated to be of the essence, the injured party may elect 
to terminate and
recover damages in respect of the promisor’s outstanding obligations, without regard to the
magnitude of the breach.
A term of the contract prescribing what damages are to be recoverable when a contract is
terminated for a breach of condition is open to being struck down as a penalty, if it is not a
genuine covenanted pre-estimate of the damage, in the same way as a clause which prescribes
the measure for any other type of breach. No doubt the position is the same where the clause is
ranked as a condition by virtue of an express provision in the contract.
8.
9.
A clause expressly assigning a particular obligation to the category of condition is not a clause
which purports to fix the damages for breaches of the obligation, and is not subject to the law
governing penalty clauses.
Thus, although in the present case clause 6 is to be struck down as a penalty, clause 2(a)(i)
remains enforceable. The plaintiffs were entitled to terminate the contract independently of clause
5, and to recover damages for loss of the future instalments. This loss was correctly computed by
the master.
These bare propositions call for comment. The first three are uncontroversial. The
fourth was not, I believe, challenged before us, but I would in any event regard it
as indisputable. That there exists a category of term, in respect of which any
breach whether large or small entitles the promisee to treat himself as discharged,
has never been doubted in modern times, and the fact that a term may be
assigned to this category by express agreement has been taken for granted for at
least a century. …
The fifth proposition is a matter of terminology, and has been more taken for
granted than discussed. …
The sixth proposition is a combination of the first five. There appears to be no
direct authority for it, and it is right to say that most of the cases on the significance
of time being of the essence have been concerned with the right of the injured
party to be discharged, rather than the principles upon which his damages are to
be computed. Nevertheless, it is axiomatic that a person who establishes a breach
of condition can terminate and claim damages for loss of the bargain, and I know
of no authority which suggests that the position is any different where late
performance is made into a breach of condition by a stipulation that time is of the
essence. …
I return to the propositions stated above. The seventh is uncontroversial, and I
would add only the rider that when deciding upon the penal nature of a clause
which prescribes a measure of recovery for damages resulting from a termination
founded upon a breach of condition, the comparison should be with the common
law measure: namely, with the loss to the promisee resulting from the loss of his
bargain. If the contract permits him to treat the contract as repudiated, the fact that
the breach is comparatively minor should in my view play no part in the equation.
I believe that the real controversy in the present case centres upon the eighth
proposition. … I acknowledge, of course, that by promoting a term into the
category where all breaches are ranked as breaches of condition, the parties
indirectly bring about a situation where, for breaches which are relatively small, the
injured party is enabled to recover damages as on the loss of the bargain, whereas
without the stipulation his measure of recovery would be different. But I am unable
to accept that this permits the court to strike down as a penalty the clause which
brings about this promotion. To do so would be to reverse the current of more than
100 years’ doctrine, which permits the parties to treat as a condition something
which would not otherwise be so. I am not prepared to take this step. …
For these reasons I conclude that the plaintiffs are entitled to retain the
damages which the master has awarded. This is not a result which I view with
much satisfaction: partly because 
the plaintiffs have achieved by one means a
result which the law of penalties might have prevented them from achieving by
another, and partly because if the line of argument under clause 2 had been
developed from the outset, the defendant might have found an answer based on
waiver which the court is now precluded from assessing, for want of the necessary
facts. Nevertheless, it is the answer to which, in my view, the authorities clearly
point. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.
Nicholls LJ
Thus far I have reached my conclusion regarding repudiation [his conclusion being
that the facts did not justify a finding of repudiation] without giving any weight or
effect to the provision in clause 2(a) of the lease, that punctual payment of each
rental instalment was of the essence of the lease.
I must now consider a further submission advanced by the plaintiffs that, time of
payment having been made of the essence by this provision, it was open to the
plaintiffs, once default in payment of any one instalment on the due date had
occurred, to treat the agreement as having been repudiated by the defendant, and
claim damages for loss of the whole transaction, even though in the absence of
this provision such a default would not have had that consequence. On this, the
question which arises is one of construction: on the true construction of the clause,
did the ‘time of the essence’ provision have the effect submitted by the plaintiffs? In
my view, the answer to that question is ‘Yes’. The provision in clause 2(a) has to be
read and construed in conjunction with the other provisions in the agreement,
including clauses 5 and 6. So read, it is to be noted that failure to pay any
instalment triggers a right for the plaintiffs to terminate the agreement by re-taking
possession of the goods (clause 5), with the expressed consequence that the
defendant becomes liable to make payments which assume that the defendant is
liable to make good to the plaintiffs the loss by them of the whole transaction
(clause 6). Given that context, the ‘time of the essence’ provision seems to me to
be intended to bring about the result that default in punctual payment is to be
regarded (to use a once fashionable term) as a breach going to the root of the
contract and, hence, as giving rise to the consequences in damages attendant
upon such a breach. I am unable to see what other purpose the ‘time of the
essence’ provision in clause 2(a) can serve or was intended to serve or what other
construction can fairly be ascribed to it.
If that construction of the agreement is correct then, as at present advised, it
seems to me that the legal consequence is that the plaintiffs are entitled to claim
damages for loss of the whole transaction. I say ‘as at present advised’, because
on this no argument to the contrary was advanced on behalf of the defendant, and
Mustill LJ’s illuminating analysis leaves no escape from the conclusion that parties
are free to agree that a particular provision in their contract shall be a condition
such that a breach of it is to be regarded as going to the root of the contract and
entitling the innocent party (1) to accept that breach as a repudiation, and (2) to be
paid damages calculated upon that footing.
I have to say that I view the impact of that principle in this case with
considerable dissatisfaction, for this reason … the principle applied in 
Financings
Ltd
 
v. 
Baldock
 
[1963] 2 QB 104 was that when an owner determines a hire
purchase agreement in exercise of a power so to do given him by the agreement
on non-payment of instalments, he can recover damages for any breaches up to
the date of termination but (in the absence of repudiation) not thereafter. There is
no practical difference between (1) an agreement containing such a power and (2)
an agreement containing a provision to the effect that time for payment of each
instalment is of the essence, so that any breach will go to the root of the contract.
The difference between these two agreements is one of drafting form, and wholly
without substance. Yet under an 
agreement drafted in the first form, the owner’s
damages claim arising upon his exercise of the power of termination is confined to
damages for breaches up to the date of termination, whereas under an agreement
drafted in the second form the owner’s damages claim, arising upon his
acceptance of an identical breach as a repudiation of the agreement, will extend to
damages for loss of the whole transaction.
Nevertheless, as at present advised, I can see no escape from the conclusion
that such is the present state of the law. This conclusion emasculates the decision
in 
Financings Ltd
 
v. 
Baldock
, for it means that a skilled draftsman can easily side-
step the effect of that decision. Indeed, that is what has occurred here.
I add only that I can see nothing in 
Financings Ltd
 
v. 
Baldock
 
itself that would
assist the defendant on this point. Each member of the court emphasised that in
that case there had been no repudiation of the agreement, and Diplock LJ
observed, at p. 118, that in that case time of payment was not of the essence of
the contract and, at p. 120, that ‘in the absence of any express provision to the
contrary in the contract’ the failure to pay two instalments on the due date did not
of themselves go to the root of the contract.
For these reasons, I too would dismiss this appeal.
Lawton LJ
 
concurred.
Commentary
The result of this case is particularly striking because the finance company first
attempted to recover the arrears as at the date of the termination and the future
instalments (subject to a discount for accelerated receipt) under clause 6, but it was held
that they could not do so because clause 6 was a penalty clause (on which see further
23.11
). But they were able to recover the same sum by way of an action for damages,
using clause 2(a) to demonstrate that the defendant had repudiated the contract. Thus
the plaintiffs were able to obtain by one method (a common law claim for damages)
something which they were unable to obtain by another method (a claim brought under
clause 6 of the contract).
Lombard
 
should be contrasted with the earlier decision of the Court of Appeal in
Financings Ltd
 
v. 
Baldock
 
[1963] 2 QB 104, where a hirer failed to pay the first two
instalments on the hire purchase of a lorry. The contract stipulated that:
should the hirer fail to pay the initial instalments … or any subsequent instalment … within ten days after the
same shall have become due or if he shall die … the owner may … by written notice … forthwith and for all
purposes terminate the hiring.
The Court of Appeal held that this clause gave the owners the right to terminate the
contract, but that they were only entitled to recover by way of damages the unpaid
instalments as at the date of the termination of the contract (and not the loss of the
future instalments). The vital difference between 
Baldock
 
and 
Lombard
 
is that clause
2(a) of the contract in 
Lombard
 
stated that time of payment was of the essence of the
contract. The effect of this was to turn a failure to pay into a breach of a condition so that
the breach was repudiatory and the plaintiffs were in consequence entitled to recover
loss of bargain damages. By contrast, the owners in 
Baldock
 
were unable to demonstrate
that the defendant had repudiated the 
contract. Breach of the clause relating to payment
was not in itself repudiatory, and they could not show that the hirer had evinced an
intention no longer to be bound by the terms of the contract. This being the case, the
owners were only entitled to recover the loss of rentals as at the date of termination.
Thus elevation of a term to the status of a condition can be important not only in
relation to the right to terminate but also for the damages recoverable upon the
termination of the contract.
The decision in 
Lombard
 
has its critics (see GH Treitel, ‘Damages on Rescission for
Breach of Contract’ [1987] 
LMCLQ
 
143 and W Bojczuk, ‘When is a Condition not a
Condition?’ [1987] 
JBL
 
353) and its supporters (B Opeskin, ‘Damages for Breach of
Contract Terminated under Express Terms’ (1990) 106 
LQR
 
293). Professor Treitel
argues that it is only where the breach is repudiatory under the general law, that is apart
from the express agreement of the parties, that the owner is entitled to recover loss of
bargain damages. In his view, loss of bargain damages should not be available where the
owner ‘rescinds for a minor breach under an express contractual provision entitling him
to do so’. The difficulty with this argument is that the law does not generally distinguish
between a condition that arises under the general law and a condition which has been
created by an express provision in the contract (see 
Stellar Chartering and Brokerage
Inc
 
v. 
Efibanca-Ente Finanziario Interbancario Spa (The Span Terza, No 2)
 
[1984] 1
WLR 27, 33). It is therefore suggested that 
Lombard
, harsh though it appears, was
correctly decided.
Lombard
 
further demonstrates that parties are free to classify as a condition a term
which would not otherwise amount to a condition. Freedom of contract here prevails.
This stands in contrast with the approach operative in some other jurisdictions where
the question whether or not a breach is sufficiently fundamental to entitle a party to
terminate is a question for the law (or the courts) and not for the parties themselves.
When considering the policy issues at stake in 
Lombard
 
it is important to remember
that the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (as amended) enacts substantial protection for
individuals who enter into hire purchase and other credit agreements. A consumer who
falls within the scope of this Act receives considerable protection; in particular, the Act
places substantial limits on the ability of the owner to retake possession of the goods.
The problem case is the one, such as 
Lombard
, which falls outside the scope of the
Consumer Credit Act 1974 because, once one is outside the scope of the Act, the
unfortunate hirer is left exposed to the chill winds of the common law.
22.3.2
 
Breach of a Warranty
A warranty is a lesser, subsidiary term of the contract. Breach of a warranty gives rise to
a claim for damages but it does not, it is suggested, give an innocent party the right to
terminate further performance of the contract. The Sale of Goods Act 1979 classifies
certain obligations of a seller of goods as warranties (see 
10.2
). Thus the term that the
goods are free from any charge or encumbrance not disclosed or known to the buyer
before the contract is made and that the buyer will enjoy quiet possession of the goods
except in so far as it may be disturbed by the owner or other person entitled to the
benefit of any charge or encumbrance so disclosed or known is classified as a warranty
(section 12(5A)).
The view that breach of a warranty cannot give rise to a right to terminate further
performance of the contract has been challenged by Professor Treitel who maintains
(
Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract Law
 
(Oxford University Press,
2002), p. 124) that:
there is the possibility that the breach of a term which is a warranty because it is … ‘collateral to the main
purpose of the contract’ may, in exceptional circumstances, have unexpectedly serious effects; and there is some
support in the judgment of Ormrod LJ in 
The Hansa Nord
 
for the view that, if a seller’s breach of warranty does
have such effects, or if the breach is one which is deliberate in the sense that the seller could easily put it right
but refuses to do so, then the buyer could reject. It is quite hard to think of a realistic sale of goods example
since the ambit of the statutorily implied terms as to quality or fitness for a particular purpose is now so wide
and since all these terms are classified by the Sale of Goods Act as conditions. Perhaps we might take the case of
a contract for the hire of a car in which the owner ‘warranted’ to make the car available at 8 am on Derby Day
and then the previous day told the hirer that it would not be available until 8 pm. In all probability, the court
would conclude that the word ‘warranty’ was not here used in its technical sense but meant ‘condition’. But if for
some reason the drafting precluded this line of reasoning, the court might well hold that in such a case it was
not appropriate to require the hirer to pay the agreed hire and then to claim damages; and that the breach,
though one of ‘warranty’, justified his immediate cancellation of the contract.
The problem which concerns Professor Treitel is the case where the breach has serious
consequences for the innocent party but the term broken has been classified by the
parties as a ‘warranty’. In many ways, this is the flip-side of 
Schuler
 
v. 
Wickman
(
22.3.1
). If the court is not satisfied that the word ‘warranty’ was used in its technical
sense, then use of the word ‘warranty’ should not act as a barrier to a party terminating
the contract where the consequences of the breach are serious. On the other hand, in the
case where the parties do use the word ‘warranty’ in its technical sense, then it is
submitted that there should be no right to terminate. Just as it is open to the parties to
agree that any term is a condition (in its technical sense) so it should be open to the
parties to agree that any term is a warranty (in its technical sense) and, in such a case,
the breach of the warranty should not give rise to a right to terminate but only a right to
recover damages. However, the courts are likely to be slow to conclude that the parties
intended to use the word ‘warranty’ in this technical sense. This being the case, unless
the term states clearly that any breach, regardless of the seriousness of the
consequences, will never entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract, it is
unlikely that the courts will conclude that the term is a warranty in its technical sense
(
Sports Connection Pte Ltd
 
v. 
Deuter Sports GmbH
 
[2009] SGCA 22, [2009] 3 SLR
883). If the term is not a warranty it is likely to be treated as an intermediate or
innominate term and the entitlement to terminate will depend largely upon the
consequences of the breach (
RDC Concrete Pte Ltd
 
v. 
Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd
 
[2007] 4
SLR 413). It is to intermediate terms that we now turn.
22.3.3
 
Breach of an Intermediate Term
The origin of intermediate terms (as we know them today) is to be found in the decision
of the Court of Appeal in 
Hong Kong Fir
 
v. 
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha
 
[1962] 2 QB 26. The
origin of this category may, perhaps, be doubtful but there is no doubt that the category
of intermediate or innominate terms exists and that they are rather prevalent. The main
contribution which they have made is that they give to the courts a degree of remedial
flexibility in that they can decide whether or not the breach was repudiatory by having
regard to the consequences of the breach rather than the nature of the term broken. The
difficulty which 
the existence of intermediate terms poses for legal advisers is that they
give rise to a degree of uncertainty in that it can be very difficult to predict whether or
not the judge will conclude that the breach was sufficiently serious to entitle the
innocent party to terminate the contract.
HONG KONG FIR SHIPPING CO LTD V. KAWASAKI
KISEN KAISHA LTD
[1962] 2 QB 26, Court of Appeal
By a time charter (that is to say, the hire of a ship for a period of time) the
shipowners agreed to deliver the vessel, the 
Hong Kong Fir
, to the charterers for a
period of 24 months. Clause 1 of the time charter stated that the vessel was ‘in
every way fitted for ordinary cargo service’ and the shipowners further undertook in
clause 3 to ‘maintain her in a thoroughly efficient state in hull and machinery during
service’. Hire was not, however, payable in respect of any period exceeding 24
hours lost as a result of the vessel undergoing repairs. Such ‘off-hire time’ was, at
the charterers’ option, to be added to the hire period.
The ship was delivered to the charterers on 13 February 1957 and set sail for
Virginia. At the date of delivery the ship was unseaworthy because her engine
rooms were under-manned and the engine-room staff were incompetent. The ship
immediately set sail for Osaka. She arrived in Osaka on 25 May 1957 but, in that
period, had been off-hire for some 30 days because of the need to carry out
repairs to her engine. When she arrived in Osaka it was discovered that the ship
would be off-hire for a further period of 15 weeks in order to carry out repairs to the
engine. During the period between February and June 1957 there was a
considerable fall in the freight market (this meant that the charter was no longer an
attractive one from the perspective of the charterers because they could obtain a
ship at a lower rate of hire elsewhere). On 6 June 1957 (and again on 11
September 1957) the charterers wrote to the shipowners to inform them that they
were terminating the charter and seeking damages for breach of contract. On 13
September 1957 the shipowners formally accepted that the contract was at an
end. The shipowners then brought an action against the charterers in which they
claimed damages on the ground that the charterers had wrongfully repudiated the
contract.
At first instance Salmon J held that the ship was unseaworthy but that the
charterers were not entitled to terminate the charter on account of the
unseaworthiness of the ship. The charterers appealed to the Court of Appeal but
their appeal was dismissed on the ground that the breach of contract by the
shipowners was not sufficiently serious to entitle the charterers to terminate further
performance of the contract.
Sellers LJ
[stated the facts and continued]
By clause 1 of the charterparty the shipowners contracted to deliver the vessel
at Liverpool ‘she being in every way fitted for ordinary cargo service’. She was not
fit for ordinary cargo service when delivered because the engine room staff was
incompetent and inadequate and this became apparent as the voyage proceeded.
It is commonplace language to say that the vessel was unseaworthy by reason of
this inefficiency in the engine room. Ships have been held to be unseaworthy in a
variety of ways and those who have been put to loss by reason thereof (in the
absence of any protecting clause in favour of a shipowner) have been able to
recover damages as for a breach of warranty. It would be unthinkable that all the
relatively 
trivial matters which have been held to be unseaworthiness could be
regarded as conditions of the contract or conditions precedent to a charterer’s
liability and justify in themselves a cancellation or refusal to perform on the part of
the charterer …
[He considered the authorities and continued]
In my judgment authority over many decades and reason support the
conclusion in this case that there was no breach of a condition which entitled the
charterers to accept it as a repudiation and to withdraw from the charter. It was not
contended that the maintenance clause is so fundamental a matter as to amount to
a condition of the contract. It is a warranty which sounds in damages.
Upjohn LJ
Why is this apparently basic and underlying condition of seaworthiness not, in fact,
treated as a condition? It is for the simple reason that the seaworthiness clause is
breached by the slightest failure to be fitted ‘in every way’ for service. Thus … if a
nail is missing from one of the timbers of a wooden vessel or if proper medical
supplies or two anchors are not on board at the time of sailing, the owners are in
breach of the seaworthiness stipulation. It is contrary to common sense to suppose
that in such circumstances the parties contemplated that the charterer should at
once be entitled to treat the contract as at an end for such trifling breaches
. …
It is open to the parties to a contract to make it clear either expressly or by
necessary implication that a particular stipulation is to be regarded as a condition
which goes to the root of the contract, so that it is clear that the parties
contemplate that any breach of it entitles the other party at once to treat the
contract as at an end. That matter has to be determined as a question of the
proper interpretation of the contract. Bramwell B in 
Tarrabochia
 
v. 
Hickie
 
1 H & N
183 has warned against the dangers of too ready an implication of such a
condition. … Where, however, upon the true construction of the contract, the
parties have not made a particular stipulation a condition, it would in my judgment
be unsound and misleading to conclude that, being a warranty, damages is
necessarily a sufficient remedy.
In my judgment the remedies open to the innocent party for breach of a
stipulation which is not a condition strictly so called, depend entirely upon the
nature of the breach and its foreseeable consequences. Breaches of stipulation
fall, naturally, into two classes. First there is the case where the owner by his
conduct indicates that he considers himself no longer bound to perform his part of
the contract; in that case, of course, the charterer may accept the repudiation and
treat the contract as at an end. The second class of case is, of course, the more
usual one and that is where, due to misfortune such as the perils of the sea,
engine failures, incompetence of the crew and so on, the owner is unable to
perform a particular stipulation precisely in accordance with the terms of the
contract try he ever so hard to remedy it. In that case the question to be answered
is, does the breach of the stipulation go so much to the root of the contract that it
makes further commercial performance of the contract impossible, or in other
words is the whole contract frustrated? If yea, the innocent party may treat the
contract as at an end. If nay, his claim sounds in damages only.
If I have correctly stated the principles, then as the stipulation as to the
seaworthiness is not a condition in the strict sense the question to be answered is,
did the initial unseaworthiness as found by the judge, and from which there has
been no appeal, go so much to the root of the contract that the charterers were
then and there entitled to treat the charterparty as at an end? The only
unseaworthiness alleged, serious though it was, was the insufficiency and
incompetence of the crew, but that surely cannot be treated as going to the root of
the 
contract for the parties must have contemplated that in such an event the crew
could be changed and augmented. In my judgment, on this part of his case
[counsel for the charterers] necessarily fails.
Diplock LJ
Every synallagmatic contract contains in it the seeds of the problem: in what event
will a party be relieved of his undertaking to do that which he has agreed to do but
has not yet done? The contract may itself expressly define some of these events,
as in the cancellation clause in a charterparty; but, human prescience being
limited, it seldom does so exhaustively and often fails to do so at all. In some
classes of contracts such as sale of goods. … Parliament has defined by statute
some of the events not provided for expressly in individual contracts of that class;
but where an event occurs the occurrence of which neither the parties nor
Parliament have expressly stated will discharge one of the parties from further
performance of his undertakings, it is for the court to determine whether the event
has this effect or not.
The test whether an event has this effect or not has been stated in a number of
metaphors all of which I think amount to the same thing: does the occurrence of
the event deprive the party who has further undertakings still to perform of
substantially the whole benefit which it was the intention of the parties as
expressed in the contract that he should obtain as the consideration for performing
those undertakings?
This test is applicable whether or not the event occurs as a result of the default
of one of the parties to the contract, but the consequences of the event are
different in the two cases. Where the event occurs as a result of the default of one
party, the party in default cannot rely upon it as relieving himself of the
performance of any further undertakings on his part, and the innocent party,
although entitled to, need not treat the event as relieving him of the further
performance of his own undertakings. This is only a specific application of the
fundamental legal and moral rule that a man should not be allowed to take
advantage of his own wrong. Where the event occurs as a result of the default of
neither party, each is relieved of the further performance of his own undertakings,
and their rights in respect of undertakings previously performed are now regulated
by the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act, 1943.
This branch of the common law has reached its present stage by the normal
process of historical growth, and the fallacy in counsel for the charterers’
contention that a different test is applicable when the event occurs as a result of
the default of one party from that applicable in cases of frustration where the event
occurs as a result of the default of neither party lies, in my view, from a failure to
view the cases in their historical context. The problem: in what event will a party to
a contract be relieved of his undertaking to do that which he has agreed to do but
has not yet done? has exercised the English courts for centuries … but until the
rigour of the rule in 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
 
(1647) Aleyn 26 was mitigated in the middle
of the last century by the classic judgments of Blackburn J in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
(1863) 3 B & S 826 and Bramwell B in 
Jackson
 
v. 
Union Marine Insurance Co Ltd
(1874) LR 10 CP 125 it was in general only events resulting from one party’s
failure to perform his contractual obligations which were regarded as capable of
relieving the other party from continuing to perform that which he had undertaken
to do …
[He considered the historical development of the law and continued]
Once it is appreciated that it is the event and not the fact that the event is a
result of a breach of contract which relieves the party not in default of further
performance of his obligations, two consequences follow. (1) The test whether the
event relied upon has this consequence 
is the same whether the event is the result
of the other party’s breach of contract or not, as Devlin J pointed out in 
Universal
Cargo Carriers Corporation
 
v. 
Citati
 
[1957] 2 QB 401, 434. (2) The question
whether an event which is the result of the other party’s breach of contract has this
consequence cannot be answered by treating all contractual undertakings as
falling into one of two separate categories: ‘conditions’ the breach of which gives
rise to an event which relieves the party not in default of further performance of his
obligations, and ‘warranties’ the breach of which does not give rise to such an
event.
Lawyers tend to speak of this classification as if it were comprehensive, partly
for … historical reasons … and partly because Parliament itself adopted it in the
Sale of Goods Act, 1893, as respects a number of implied terms in contracts for
the sale of goods and has in that Act used the expressions ‘condition’ and
‘warranty’ in that meaning. But it is by no means true of contractual undertakings in
general at common law.
No doubt there are many simple contractual undertakings, sometimes express
but more often because of their very simplicity (‘It goes without saying’) to be
implied, of which it can be predicated that every breach of such an undertaking
must give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially
the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract and
such a stipulation, unless the parties have agreed that breach of it shall not entitle
the non-defaulting party to treat the contract as repudiated, is a ‘condition’. So too
there may be other simple contractual undertakings of which it can be predicated
that no breach can give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default
of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from
the contract; and such a stipulation, unless the parties have agreed that breach of
it shall entitle the non-defaulting party to treat the contract as repudiated, is a
‘warranty’.
There are, however, many contractual undertakings of a more complex
character which cannot be categorised as being ‘conditions’ or ‘warranties’, if the
late nineteenth-century meaning adopted in the Sale of Goods Act 1893, and used
by Bowen LJ in 
Bentsen
 
v. 
Taylor, Sons & Co
 
[1893] 2 QB 274, 280 be given to
those terms. Of such undertakings all that can be predicated is that some
breaches will and others will not give rise to an event which will deprive the party
not in default of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he
should obtain from the contract; and the legal consequences of a breach of such
an undertaking, unless provided for expressly in the contract, depend upon the
nature of the event to which the breach gives rise and do not follow automatically
from a prior classification of the undertaking as a ‘condition’ or a ‘warranty’. For
instance, to take Bramwell B’s example in 
Jackson
 
v. 
Union Marine Insurance Co
Ltd
 
LR 10 CP 125, 142 itself, breach of an undertaking by a shipowner to sail with
all possible dispatch to a named port does not necessarily relieve the charterer of
further performance of his obligation under the charterparty, but if the breach is so
prolonged that the contemplated voyage is frustrated it does have this effect …
As my brethren have already pointed out, the shipowners’ undertaking to tender
a seaworthy ship has, as a result of numerous decisions as to what can amount to
‘unseaworthiness’, become one of the most complex of contractual undertakings. It
embraces obligations with respect to every part of the hull and machinery, stores
and equipment and the crew itself. It can be broken by the presence of trivial
defects easily and rapidly remediable as well as by defects which must inevitably
result in a total loss of the vessel. Consequently the problem in this case is, in my
view, neither solved nor soluble by debating whether the shipowner’s express or
implied undertaking to tender a seaworthy ship is a ‘condition’ or a ‘warranty’. It is
like so many other contractual terms an undertaking one breach of which may give
rise to an event which relieves the charterer of further performance of his
undertakings if he so elects and another breach of which may not give rise to such
an event but entitle him only to monetary compensation in the form of damages. It
is, with all deference to counsel 
for the charterers’ skilful argument, by no means
surprising that among the many hundreds of previous cases about the shipowner’s
undertaking to deliver a seaworthy ship there is none where it was found profitable
to discuss in the judgments the question whether that undertaking is a ‘condition’
or a ‘warranty’; for the true answer, as I have already indicated, is that it is neither,
but one of that large class of contractual undertakings one breach of which may
have the same effect as that ascribed to a breach of ‘condition’ under the Sale of
Goods Act, 1893, and a different breach of which may have only the same effect
as that ascribed to a breach of ‘warranty’ under that Act.
What the learned judge had to do in the present case, as in any other case
where one party to a contract relies upon a breach by the other party as giving him
a right to elect to rescind the contract, and the contract itself makes no express
provision as to this, was to look at the events which had occurred as a result of the
breach at the time at which the charterers purported to rescind the charterparty
and to decide whether the occurrence of those events deprived the charterers of
substantially the whole benefit which it was the intention of the parties as
expressed in the charterparty that the charterers should obtain from the further
performance of their own contractual undertakings. …
The question which the learned judge had to ask himself was, as he rightly
decided, whether or not at the date when the charterers purported to rescind the
contract, namely, June 6, 1957, or when the shipowners purported to accept such
rescission, namely, August 8, 1957, the delay which had already occurred as a
result of the incompetence of the engine-room staff, and the delay which was likely
to occur in repairing the engines of the vessel and the conduct of the shipowners
by that date in taking steps to remedy these two matters, were, when taken
together, such as to deprive the charterers of substantially the whole benefit which
it was the intention of the parties they should obtain from further use of the vessel
under the charterparty.
In my view, in his judgment—on which I would not seek to improve—the judge
took into account and gave due weight to all the relevant considerations and
arrived at the right answer for the right reasons.
Commentary
The vital factor in persuading the Court of Appeal to conclude that the obligation to
provide a seaworthy ship was an intermediate term was that the term could have been
broken in a trivial manner (which could be remedied adequately by an award of
damages) or in a way that was so fundamental that it would have undermined the
purpose which the parties had in mind in entering into the contract. The conclusion that
either every breach gave rise to a right to terminate further performance of the contract
or that no breach gave rise to a right to terminate was too stark a choice for the court.
The common law was capable of providing a more proportionate and calibrated
approach. That approach was to have regard to the consequences of the breach
(although it is not entirely clear that the judges intended to create a new category of
intermediate terms in so deciding).
Intermediate terms are now well established in the case-law. Their introduction has
generated two difficulties. The first lies in distinguishing an intermediate term from a
condition and a warranty (an issue which is discussed in the next section). The second
difficulty is one of ascertaining how serious the consequences of the breach must be
before an innocent party is entitled to terminate for breach of an intermediate term. The
test must be applied at the date of the purported termination of the contract, not the
date of the breach itself. However, 
the test is not an easy one to apply and much will
depend upon the facts of the individual case. The critical question is: how ‘serious’ must
the consequences of the breach be before the breach is held to be repudiatory? The best
answer one can give is that it must be very serious. As Lewison LJ observed in 
Telford
Homes (Creekside) Ltd
 
v. 
Ampurius Nu Homes Holdings Ltd
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 577,
[2013] 4 All ER 377, [48], the test ‘sets the bar high’ because the analogy drawn by
Diplock LJ in 
Hong Kong Fir
 
was with cases in which a contract has been frustrated.
The innocent party must establish either that it has been deprived of ‘substantially the
whole benefit’ of the contract or that it has been deprived of a ‘substantial part of the
benefit to which [it] is entitled under the contract’ (
Decro-Wall International SA
 
v.
Practitioners in Marketing Ltd
 
[1971] 1 WLR 361, 380). To the extent that there is a
difference between the two formulations of the test, the former is the one that is most
regularly applied by the courts (
Urban I (Blonk Street) Ltd
 
v. 
Ayres
 
[2013] EWCA Civ
816, [2014] 1 WLR 756, [57]).
Case-law demonstrates that the courts have regard to a range of factors in deciding
whether or not the breach is sufficiently serious. Factors to which the courts have regard
include the benefit which it was intended that the innocent party would obtain from
performance of the contract, the losses suffered by the innocent party as a result of the
breach, the cost of making performance comply with the terms of the contract, the value
of the performance that has been received by the innocent party, the willingness of the
party in breach to make good the consequences of the breach, the likelihood of a further
breach by the party in breach, and the adequacy of damages as a remedy to the innocent
party. Given the range of factors to which the courts have regard and their generality,
the balancing of these factors must, at the end of the day, depend to a large extent upon
the facts of the individual case.
This uncertainty can cause difficulty in practice. Suppose a case in which the
consequences of the breach are serious but not disastrous and the innocent party has
substantial doubts about the ability of his contracting party to perform in the future
(although he is unlikely to be able to prove that he will not be able to perform in the
future). What advice should be given to the innocent party who informs his lawyer that
he wishes to terminate the contract? At this point it is important to recall that a party
who purports to terminate a contract when not in fact entitled to do so will be held to
have repudiated the contract (for recent examples in which a purported termination was
held to be a repudiatory breach see 
Telford Homes (Creekside) Ltd
 
v. 
Ampurius Nu
Homes Holdings Ltd
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 577, [2013] 4 All ER 377 and 
Urban I (Blonk
Street) Ltd
 
v. 
Ayres
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 816, [2014] 1 WLR 756). This being the case,
advisers to the innocent party may be likely to err on the side of caution: that is to say
they are likely to advise him that a decision to terminate carries with it a risk that a court
may subsequently decide that he was not entitled to terminate and hold him liable in
damages for the loss suffered by the other party as a result of any wrongful termination.
On the other hand, if he contents himself with a claim for damages for the loss that he
has suffered as a result of the breach, he should be compensated for the loss that he has
suffered and will eliminate the risk of incurring any liability to the other party. A risk-
averse party is unlikely to terminate in such a case. In this way, classification of a term
as an intermediate term may operate in practice to inhibit use of termination as a
remedy.
22.3.4
 
Making the Choice
How do courts decide whether or not a particular term is a condition, a warranty, or an
innominate term? Where the nature of the term has been classified by Parliament, the
courts must clearly respect and give effect to that classification. A similar analysis
prevails where 
binding authority requires a court to follow the decision of an earlier
court. And in the case where the nature of the term has been classified by the parties, the
courts will, subject to the considerations which influenced the House of Lords in 
Schuler
v. 
Wickman
, respect the choice of the parties.
But what do the courts do in the case where the term has not been previously classified?
In 
Grand China Logistics Holding (Group) Co Ltd
 
v. 
Spar Shipping AS
 
[2016] EWCA
Civ 982, [2016] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 447, [92] Hamblen LJ stated that ‘the modern English law
approach to the classification of contractual terms is that a term is innominate unless it
is clear that it is intended to be a condition or a warranty’. The default position would
thus appear to be to classify a term as innominate rather than as a condition (see also
Ark Shipping Company LLC
 
v. 
Silverburn Shipping (IoM) Ltd
 
[2019] EWCA Civ 1161,
[2019] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 603).
An example cited by Hamblen LJ is the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Cehave NV
 
v.
Bremer Handelsgesellschaft mbH (The Hansa Nord)
 
[1976] QB 44. The parties entered
into two contracts for the sale of citrus pulp pellets. Clause 7 of the contract stated:
‘Shipment to be made in good condition … each shipment shall be considered a separate
contract.’ The buyers paid the price of approximately £100,000 in exchange for the
shipping documents. However they rejected the entire cargo on its arrival in Rotterdam
on the ground that part of the cargo in one of the holds was found to be damaged. The
goods were then sold pursuant to a court order and, through a third party, the buyers
were able to purchase them for some £30,000. In these circumstances the buyers sought
to recover the purchase price from the sellers. They claimed that they were entitled to
reject the goods and recover the price on two grounds. The first was that there had been
a breach by the sellers of clause 7 of the contract and the second was that the goods were
not of ‘merchantable quality’ so that the sellers were in breach of section 14(2) of the
Sale of Goods Act 1893. The buyers succeeded in their arguments before a trade
arbitration panel and before Mocatta J, but the sellers appealed successfully to the Court
of Appeal. In relation to the buyers’ submission that there had been a breach of section
14(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, the Court of Appeal held that the goods were in fact of
merchantable quality on the basis that they remained fit for their intended purpose and
were, indeed, used by the buyers for that purpose. In relation to the breach of clause 7 of
the contract, the Court of Appeal concluded that the buyers were entitled to damages but
that the breach did not entitle them to terminate the contract. Clause 7 had not been
expressly classified by the parties as a condition, nor was the court bound by authority
to conclude that it was a condition. In the absence of party stipulation and binding
authority, the court concluded that clause 7 was an intermediate term and not a
condition. Thus Lord Denning MR stated that small-scale deviations from the
contractual standard should be met by a price allowance and that ‘buyers should not
have a right to reject the whole cargo unless [the deficiency] was serious and
substantial’. To similar effect is the following passage from the judgment of Roskill LJ
(at pp. 70–71):
In my view, a court should not be over ready, unless required by statute or authority to do so, to construe a term
in a contract as a ‘condition’ any breach of which gives rise to a right to reject rather than as a term any breach
of which sounds in damages. … In principle, contracts are made to be performed and not to be avoided
according to the whims of market fluctuation and where there is free choice between two possible constructions
I think the court should tend to prefer that construction which will ensure performance, and not encourage
avoidance of contractual obligations.
But the conclusion that the term is innominate is not an inevitable one. Cases can be
found in which the courts have gone the other way and classified the term as a
condition. One such case is the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Maredelanto
Compania Naviera SA
 
v. 
Bergbau-Handel GmbH (The Mihalis Angelos)
 
[1971] 1 QB
164. The owners chartered the vessel 
Mihalis Angelos
 
to the charterers for a voyage
from Haiphong in North Vietnam to Hamburg. Clause 1 of the charterparty stated that
the vessel was ‘expected ready to load under this charter about 1 July 1965’. The owners
had no reasonable basis for this expectation. The 
Mihalis Angelos
 
was in use on another
voyage and was not expected to arrive at Haiphong until 13 or 14 July. Meanwhile the
charterers discovered that they had problems of their own. They had chartered the
vessel in order to transport a cargo of apatite to Europe but they discovered that there
was no apatite ore available in North Vietnam. They believed that the lack of apatite was
attributable to the war then taking place in Vietnam and so they purported to cancel the
contract on the ground of force majeure. The shipowners interpreted this as a
repudiation of the contract by the charterers and sought to recover damages from the
charterers. One of the issues before the court was whether or not clause 1 of the contract
was a condition or a warranty. The Court of Appeal held that it was a condition with the
result that the charterers were entitled to terminate the charter, notwithstanding the
fact that they had initially sought to justify their decision to terminate the contract on a
completely different ground. Megaw LJ reached the conclusion that clause 1 was a
condition for ‘four inter-related reasons’. These were:
First, it tends towards certainty in the law. One of the essential elements of law is some measure of uniformity.
One of the important elements of the law is predictability. At any rate in commercial law, there are obvious and
substantial advantages in having, where possible, a firm and definite rule for a particular class of legal
relationship: for example, as here, the legal categorisation of a particular, definable type of contractual clause in
common use. It is surely much better, both for shipowners and charterers (and, incidentally, for their advisers),
when a contractual obligation of this nature is under consideration, and still more when they are faced with the
necessity for an urgent decision as to the effects of a suspected breach of it, to be able to say categorically: ‘If a
breach is proved, then the charterer can put an end to the contract’, rather than that they should be left to
ponder whether or not the courts would be likely, in the particular case, when the evidence has been heard, to
decide that in the particular circumstances the breach was or was not such as ‘to go to the root of the contract’.
Where justice does not require greater flexibility, there is everything to be said for, and nothing against, a
degree of rigidity in legal principle.
Second, it would, in my opinion, only be in the rarest case, if ever, that a shipowner could legitimately feel
that he had suffered an injustice by reason of the law having given to a charterer the right to put an end to the
contract because of the breach by the shipowner of a clause such as this. If a shipowner has chosen to assert
contractually, but dishonestly or without reasonable grounds, that he expects his vessel to be ready to load on
such-and-such a date, wherein does the grievance lie?
Third, it is, as Mocatta J held, clearly established by authority binding on this court that where a clause
‘expected ready to load’ is included in a contract for the sale of goods to be carried by sea, that clause is a
condition, in the sense that any breach of it enables the buyer to reject the goods without having to show that
the dishonest or unreasonable expectation of the seller has in fact been prejudicial to the buyer. The judgment
of Bankes LJ, in which 
Warrington LJ and Atkin LJ concurred, in 
Finnish Government
 
v. 
H Ford & Co Ltd
(1921) 6 Ll L Rep 188 is in point. The clause there was ‘Steamers expected ready to load February and/or March
1920’. Bankes LJ said, at p. 189: ‘I come to the conclusion … that this clause is one containing a contract. It is a
contract which is in its nature a condition. …’ That authority is not only binding on this court, but is, I think,
completely and desirably in conformity with the line of cases which have decided—and the law in that respect is
now accepted as being beyond dispute—that a statement in a contract of sale as to the loading period is a
condition in the sense which I have indicated. If the contract says ‘loading to be during July’, the buyer can
reject the goods if the loading was not complete until midday on August 1. He is not limited to claiming
damages; he is not obliged to show that he has suffered any damage.
It would, in my judgment, produce an undesirable anomaly in our commercial law if such a clause
—‘expected ready to load’—were to be held to have a materially different legal effect where it is contained in a
charterparty from that which it has when it is contained in a sale of goods contract. True, in the latter case the
relevant ‘expectation’ is that of the seller of the goods, who may himself be the charterer; whereas in the former
case the relevant ‘expectation’ is that of the shipowner. But I do not see that that fact is sufficient to warrant the
making of a distinction between the two. True, also, as was stressed by counsel for the owners, the charterparty
will almost invariably include a cancelling clause; and it is argued that that fact justifies the drawing of a
distinction. Again, I think not, for various reasons. One of them is that the date before which the cancelling
clause cannot be exercised … is itself normally fixed by reference to the date of expected readiness to load, and
on the assumption that that is an honest and reasonable expectation.
The fourth reason why I think that the clause should be regarded as being a condition when it is found in a
charterparty is that that view was the view of Scrutton LJ so expressed in his capacity as the author of 
Scrutton
on Charterparties
.
It is important here to see that the court is engaged in a balancing exercise as it
endeavours to ascertain whether the term in dispute should be classified as a condition
or an innominate term. A similar approach can be seen at work in the decision of the
House of Lords in 
Bunge Corporation New York
 
v. 
Tradax Export SA
 
[1981] 1 WLR 711.
The parties entered into a contract which incorporated the terms of GAFTA 119 (an
industry-wide standard-form contract). The dispute between the parties related to the
June shipment of goods. The responsibilities of the parties in relation to the shipment of
the goods were divided as follows. The time of shipment was at the buyer’s option but
the sellers had the option as to the port of shipment. Clause 7 of the contract further
provided that the ‘buyers shall give at least 15 consecutive days’ notice of probable
readiness of vessel(s)’. The last day of the delivery period for the June shipment was 30
June 1975 and so, counting back from that date, the last day on which the buyers could
give notice consistently with their obligation under clause 7 was 12 June. The buyers in
fact gave notice on 17 June. The sellers refused to accept the notice as a valid notice,
declared the buyers to be in default, and claimed damages on the basis that the buyers
had repudiated the contract through their failure to comply with the terms of clause 7.
The buyers argued that their breach of clause 7 of the contract was not a repudiatory
breach of contract. They submitted that clause 7 was an intermediate or an innominate
term and that the consequences of the breach were not sufficiently serious to entitle the
sellers to terminate the contract because the breach had not deprived them of
‘substantially the 
whole benefit which it was intended that they should obtain from the
contract’. Further, the buyers argued that clause 7 was not a condition because, in order
to amount to a condition, the sellers had to show that every breach of the clause would
result in a loss to the sellers of substantially the whole benefit of the contract. The
buyers’ arguments were rejected by the House of Lords. It was held that clause 7 of the
contract was, on its true construction, a condition of the contract so that the sellers were
entitled to terminate further performance of the contract and claim damages from the
buyers on the basis that the buyers had repudiated the contract.
The combination of a number of factors persuaded the House of Lords to conclude that
the term was a condition. The first, emphasized by Lord Roskill, was the need for
certainty in commercial transactions. Secondly, as Lord Lowry pointed out, buyers and
sellers operate in a market where one day they may be buyers and on another day they
will be sellers. In such a market there is evidently a need for clear rules so that parties
can decide whether or not they are entitled to terminate further performance of the
contract. Thirdly, the judges had regard to the fact that the obligations of the parties
were interdependent (until the buyer gave the requisite notice the sellers could not
exercise their right to nominate the port of shipment). Fourthly, the experience of
businessmen was thought to support the conclusion that clause 7 was a condition.
Fifthly, the fact that damages for breach of clause 7 would have been very difficult to
assess was a further factor which suggested that termination was the remedy which the
parties had in mind for a breach of clause 7. Finally, their Lordships rejected the
submission made by counsel for the buyers that, in order to amount to a condition, the
breach must be such as to deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit
which it was intended that he should receive from the contract. A similar balancing
exercise to that undertaken in 
Bunge
 
was adopted by the House of Lords in 
Compagnie
Commerciale Sucres et Denrées
 
v. 
C Czarnikow Ltd (The Naxos)
 
[1990] 1 WLR 1337,
where it was held that the sellers had breached a condition of the contract in failing to
have the goods ready to be delivered on the arrival of the vessel into port.
At this point it is important to return to the observation of Hamblen LJ in 
Grand China
Logistics
 
that the modern approach is that a term is innominate unless a contrary
intention is made clear. Both 
Bunge
 
and 
The Mihalis Angelos
 
demonstrate that it is
possible to satisfy a court that the parties did have a contrary intention, even when that
intention has not been set out in express terms by the parties. But the onus is on the
parties to provide evidence from which the court can infer that the parties did intend
that the disputed term be classified as a condition. Otherwise, the court is likely to
classify the term as innominate (see 
Ark Shipping Company LLC
 
v. 
Silverburn Shipping
(IoM) Ltd
 
[2019] EWCA Civ 1161, [2019] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 603).
22.3.5
 
Termination Clauses
Rather than have to classify the nature of each and every term of the contract,
commercial parties sometimes insert into their contracts a termination clause which
confers on the parties (or one of them) an express right to terminate the contract in
certain defined circumstances. These clauses can be drafted in very broad terms but, as
the next case demonstrates, judges can, by a process of construction, cut down the
apparent scope of a termination clause.
RICE (T/A GARDEN GUARDIAN) V. GREAT YARMOUTH
BOROUGH COUNCIL
[2003] TCLR 1, Court of Appeal
The claimant entered into two contracts with the defendant local authority. The first
contract was for the maintenance and management of the local authority’s sport
facilities (such as its cricket and football pitches) and the second was for the
maintenance of the local authority’s parks, gardens, and children’s playgrounds.
The contracts were dated 14 February 1996 and their duration was stated to be
four years from 1 January 1996. Between 9 May 1996 and July 1996 the local
authority served a number of default notices on the claimant and on 5 August 1996
letters were hand delivered to the claimant informing him that the local authority
had decided to terminate the contract. The claimant sought to recover from the
defendant damages for wrongful termination of the contract. The defendant
claimed that it was entitled to terminate the contract under clause 23.2.1 which
stated that:
‘if the contractor commits a breach of any of its obligations under the Contract; … the Council may,
without prejudice to any accrued rights or remedies under the Contract, terminate the Contractor’s
employment under the Contract by notice in writing having immediate effect.’
Clause 27 of the contract also entitled the defendant to issue against the claimant
a notice of default, which specified the misconduct and the time allowed for
rectification. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant had not been entitled to
terminate the contract and further held that the claimant was entitled to recover
damages in respect of the loss which he had suffered as a result of the defendant’s
wrongful termination of the contract.
Hale LJ
[having set out the facts and the relevant contract clauses continued]
17.
 
The council argued first that clause 23.2.1 should be applied literally so as
to give them the right to terminate the contract for the breach of any of the
obligations contained in it, other than the trivial. The judge was referred to a
number of well-known authorities. On the one hand, ‘it is open to the parties to
agree that, as regards a particular obligation, any breach shall entitle the party not
in default to treat the contract as repudiated’: see 
Bunge Corporation
 
v. 
Tradax
Export SA
 
[1981] 1 WLR 711, per Lord Wilberforce at 715E. On the other hand ‘ …
if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is
going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business commonsense, it must yield to
business commonsense’: see 
Antaios Compania SA
 
v. 
Salen Rederierna
 
[1985]
AC 191, per Lord Diplock at p. 201D …
20.
 
As is well known, the classic position in English (but not Scottish) contract
law was that the consequences of breach depended upon the importance of the
term broken. A minor breach of an important term, a condition, could entitle the
innocent party to terminate the contract. Breach of a less important term, a
warranty, would sound only in damages. Then along came the seminal case of
Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd
 
[1962] 2 QB 26, in
which Diplock LJ, in the words of Lord Wilberforce in 
Bunge
 
v. 
Tradax
, above, at p.
714G,
‘ … illuminated the existence in contracts of terms which are neither, necessarily, conditions nor
warranties, but in terminology which has since been applied to them, intermediate or innominate terms
capable of operating, according to the gravity of the breach, as either conditions or warranties.’
21. Lord Wilberforce emphasised, in the words already quoted in paragraph [17]
above, that it is still open to the parties to agree that a term is so important to them
that it should have that effect. He continued:
‘It remains true, as Lord Roskill has pointed out in 
Cehave NV
 
v. 
Bremer Handelsgesellschaft mbH (The
Hansa Nord)
 
[1976] QB 44, that courts should not be too ready to interpret contractual clauses as
conditions. … But I do not doubt that, in suitable cases, the courts should not be reluctant, if the
intentions of the parties as shown by the contract so indicate, to hold that an obligation has the force of a
condition.’
22. The problem with the council’s argument in this case is that clause 23.2.1 does
not characterise any particular term as a condition or indicate which terms are to
be considered so important that any breach will justify termination. It appears to
visit the same draconian consequences upon any breach, however small, of any
obligation, however small. In this it is unlike cases, such as 
Bunge
, which
concerned an obviously vital time clause that can only be broken in one way, and
much closer to the cases, such as 
Hong Kong Fir Shipping
 
and 
The Antaios
,
concerning multi-faceted obligations, which can be broken in many different ways.
23.
 
The comparable term in 
The Antaios
 
provided that ‘on any breach of this
charterparty, the owners shall be at liberty to withdraw the vessel’ … The owners
sought to do so on discovering that inaccurate bills of lading had been issued. As
Lord Diplock observed, the dispute:
‘was a typical case of a shipowner seeking to find an excuse to bring a long term time charter to a
premature end in a rising market. Stripped to its essentials the shipowners were seeking to rely upon the
charterers breach of an innominate term in the charterparty relating to the charterer’s rights … to issue
bills of lading … as constituting “any other breach of this charterparty” …’
Lord Diplock agreed entirely with the arbitrators’ view that:
‘the owner’s construction is wholly unreasonable, totally uncommercial and in total contradiction to the
whole purpose of the NYPE time charter form.’
The contract should not be interpreted in such a way as to defeat its commercial
purpose.
24.
 
[Counsel for the defendant] seeks to distinguish clause 23.2.1 from the
clause in 
The Antaios
 
on the basis that the latter referred to ‘any breach of this
charterparty’, while clause 23.2.1 refers to the ‘breach of any of its obligations
under this contract’. While the Antaios term might be limited to a breach defeating
the whole contract, the term here might refer to any material or non-trivial breach.
The judge characterised this distinction as a semantic one and I agree with him.
For the reasons which the judge gave, the notion that this term would entitle the
council to terminate a contract such as this at any time for any breach of any term
flies in the face of commercial common sense …
28.
 
In my view the judge was entirely right to reach the conclusion he did on
this aspect of the case and for the reasons he gave.
The second issue
29. The council argued that, in any event, the totality of breaches found by the
judge were sufficient to justify it in terminating the contract. …
35.
 
The question for the court (and indeed the contracting parties) in any case
like this is whether the cumulative effect of the breaches of contract complained of
is so serious as to justify the innocent party in bringing the contract to a premature
end. The technical term is ‘repudiatory’ but that is just a label to describe the
consequence which may flow. It is not always an entirely satisfactory label, if it
implies that the conduct itself must always be such 
as to demonstrate an intention
to abandon contractual obligations: while this will sometimes be so it is not an
invariable requirement. As the judge indicated, there are in effect three categories:
(1) those cases in which the parties have agreed either that the term is so
important that any breach will justify termination or that the particular breach is so
important that it will justify termination; (2) those contractors who simply walk away
from their obligations thus clearly indicating an intention no longer to be bound;
and (3) those cases in which the cumulative effect of the breaches which have
taken place is sufficiently serious to justify the innocent party in bringing the
contract to a premature end.
36.
 
It is clear that the test of what is sufficiently serious to bring the case within
the third of these categories is severe. No case has been cited to us which
addresses this question in the context of a long running contract to provide public
services such as this. There are some parallels with a charterparty, but that is a
somewhat less complex undertaking than these. There are also some parallels
with building contracts, in the number and variety of the obligations involved and
the varying gravity of the breaches which may be committed, some of which may
be remediable and some not …
37.
 
Building contracts differ from these contracts in that there will, it is hoped,
be an end product. Defects may or should be remedied during or, in some cases,
after completion. Delay in completion can be compensated. These contracts
contemplated a multitude of different results at different times, from cricket pitches
ready for the summer season, football pitches ready for the autumn, flower beds in
full bloom at the appropriate times, properly mown grass on lawns and bowling
greens, raked bunkers in a pitch and putt course, edged and weeded rose beds,
pruned shrubs, cleared litter, and so on and so on. [Counsel for the claimant]
accepted that in the case of a four year contract such as this, the court is entitled
to look at the contractor’s performance over a year, the most important part of
which is the spring and summer, but it must still ask itself whether the council was
deprived of substantially the whole benefit of what it had contracted for during that
period.
38.
 
These contracts are, however, like building contracts in that the
accumulation of past breaches is relevant, not only for its own sake, but also for
what it shows about the future. In my view, the judge was right to ask himself
whether the cumulative breaches were such as to justify an inference that the
contractor would continue to deliver a substandard performance. However, I would
agree with [counsel for the claimant] that the inference should be that the council
would thereby be deprived of a substantial part of the totality of that which it had
contracted for that year, subject to the additional possibility that some aspects of
the contract were so important that the parties are to be taken to have intended
that depriving the council of that part of the contract would be sufficient in itself.
That is not what the judge found in this case.
39.
 
Once it is accepted that the proven breaches are relevant to show what will
happen in the future, it is clear that the judge was entitled to take both the drought
and the knock on effect of the council’s own behaviour in relation to the summer
bedding into account. He examined the facts of this case in great detail over a trial
lasting some 13 days. He was well placed to evaluate the true importance of the
proven breaches in the context of the contracts as a whole and all the
circumstances of the case. He had a judgment to make. If anything, the test which
he applied was somewhat more favourable to the council than the test which, in
my judgment, he should have applied. He was undoubtedly entitled to reach the
conclusion that he did.
40.
 
I would dismiss this appeal.
May LJ
 
and 
Peter Gibson LJ
 
concurred.
Commentary
Two points of significance emerge from this case. The first is that, in deciding whether
or not there has been a repudiatory breach of contract, it is permissible to take a
cumulative approach and have regard to the range of breaches committed by the party
in breach. The second and much more important point relates to the interpretation of
clause 23.2.1 adopted by the Court of Appeal. It held that it gave the council the right to
terminate the contract only on the occurrence of a repudiatory breach of contract. There
are two substantial objections to this interpretation. First, the council had a right to
terminate under the general law on the occurrence of a repudiatory breach so why insert
a clause into the contract if its only effect was to replicate a right that already existed
under the general law? Secondly, the Court of Appeal failed to give sufficient weight to
the word ‘any’ in the clause (‘if the contractor commits a breach of 
any
 
of its obligations
under the contract, the Council may … terminate the Contractor’s employment’). The
response of the Court of Appeal to this objection was that the notion that this term
entitled the council to terminate the contract at any time for any breach of any term flew
in the face of commercial common sense. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the
Court of Appeal allowed its perception of ‘commercial common sense’ to override the
ordinary meaning of the words in the contract (contrast 
Looney
 
v. 
Trafigura Beheer BV
[2011] EWHC 125 (Ch), [2011] All ER (D) 17 (Feb), where it was held that the defendants
had an unfettered right to terminate provided that they paid the relevant termination
fee). Further, the effect of doing so was to expose the council to a claim for substantial
damages for wrongful termination.
This decision gives rise to significant drafting difficulties. Termination clauses are
regularly used in practice and this decision has caused a degree of consternation among
practitioners. Is it possible to draft a clause which gives a right to terminate the contract
when the breach is not a repudiatory breach at common law? Many practitioners rely on
phrases such as ‘material breach’ (see 
Dalkia Utilities Services plc
 
v. 
Celtech
International Ltd
 
[2006] EWHC 63 (Comm), [2006] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 599, [90]–[102]), or
‘substantial breach’ but it is difficult to see on what basis the insertion of the words
‘material’ or ‘substantial’ can improve matters. In many ways it seems rather odd to
suggest, as some have done, that a party can be better off by the inclusion of the words
‘material’ or ‘substantial’ because the clause in 
Great Yarmouth
 
purported to entitle the
council to terminate the contract if the contractor committed a breach of ‘any’ of its
obligations under the contract. A party who wishes to have the benefit of a wide right to
terminate might be better advised to stipulate that the right to terminate arises in the
event of ‘any breach (whether or not that breach is repudiatory)’. 
Great Yarmouth
 
is an
important case because it demonstrates the importance of drafting issues and the
important role that interpretation of clauses can play in the development of the law.
Judges can wield significant power through the process of interpretation. It is difficult to
resist the conclusion of the Court of Appeal of Singapore in 
Fu Yuan Foodstuff
Manufacturer Pte Ltd
 
v. 
Methodist Welfare Services
 
[2009] SGCA 23, [2009] 3 SLR
925, [36] that the Court of Appeal in 
Great Yarmouth
 
‘read down’ the scope of the
termination clause in order to control its operation. The legitimacy of this restrictive
approach to interpretation is open to question.
One further issue which has given rise to difficulty in recent case-law is the relationship
between a contractual right to terminate and the rights which the party wishing to
terminate has under the general law of contract. The fact that a contracting party has
terminated the contract pursuant to an express term of the contract does not have the
automatic effect of preventing that party from relying on such rights as it has under the
general law. Thus it is 
possible for a party to terminate the contract pursuant to an
express term of the contract and to recover damages under the general law (see 
Stocznia
Gdynia SA
 
v. 
Gearbulk Holdings Ltd
 
[2009] EWCA Civ 75, [2009] BLR 196). The right
to recover damages under the general law is a valuable right and a court is unlikely to be
satisfied that a contracting party has abandoned such a valuable right arising by
operation of law ‘unless the terms of the contract make it sufficiently clear that that was
intended’ (see 
Stocznia Gdynia
 
v. 
Gearbulk Holdings
, relying upon 
Gilbert-Ash
(Northern) Ltd
 
v. 
Modern Engineering (Bristol) Ltd
 
[1974] AC 689, 717).
22.3.6
 
The Relevance of Good Faith
The point has been made that the existence of a breach of contract is not generally
dependent upon a finding that the party said to be in breach has been at fault. Liability
for breach of contract is, in principle, strict. But there is a line of cases in which the
courts appear to have had regard to the good faith of the party in breach when deciding
whether or not the breach of contract was a repudiatory breach which entitled the other
party to terminate the contract. The cases are not easy to reconcile. In some cases (such
as 
Vaswani
 
v. 
Italian Motors (Sales and Services) Ltd
 
[1996] 1 WLR 270 and 
Woodar
Investment Development Ltd
 
v. 
Wimpey Construction UK Ltd
 
[1980] 1 WLR 277) the
courts have demonstrated a certain reluctance to conclude that a party who has acted in
good faith has repudiated the contract. While one can understand the reluctance of a
court to reach that conclusion, it does not sit easily with the general rule that a breach is
a breach whether it is committed in bad faith or in good faith. Thus it is not surprising to
find cases in which the courts have concluded that a party who acted in good faith did
nevertheless commit a repudiatory breach of contract (see, for example, 
Federal
Commerce & Navigation Co Ltd
 
v. 
Molena Alpha Inc
 
[1979] AC 757).
How are these cases to be reconciled? This question does not admit of an easy answer. A
recent attempt at an answer has, however, been provided by the Court of Appeal in
Eminence Property Developments Ltd
 
v. 
Heaney
 
[2010] EWCA Civ 1168, [2011] 2 All
ER (Comm) 223. The purchaser of a property failed to complete the purchase on the
contractual completion date. The vendors accordingly issued a notice to complete as
they were entitled to do under the contract. Unfortunately, the vendors’ solicitor made a
mistake in calculating the requisite notice period and, consequently, issued a notice
which did not give the vendor the required number of days in which to complete. When
the purchaser failed to complete in accordance with the notice, the vendors decided to
terminate the contract and they issued a notice accordingly. The purchaser immediately
responded to the effect that the termination of the contract in these circumstances
amounted to a repudiatory breach of contract which the purchaser accepted, thereby
bringing the contract between the parties to an end. The vendors acknowledged their
mistake and offered to give to the purchaser a further period in which to complete, but
the purchaser declined to do so and insisted that the contract between the parties had
come to an end on its acceptance of the vendors’ repudiatory breach.
The Court of Appeal held that the vendors had not committed a repudiatory breach of
contract. After reviewing the case-law (including such apparently conflicting cases as
Woodar Investment Development Ltd
 
v. 
Wimpey Construction UK Ltd
 
[1980] 1 WLR
277 and 
Federal Commerce & Navigation Co Ltd
 
v. 
Molena Alpha Inc
 
[1979] AC 757),
Etherton LJ identified the central question which is to be asked in cases of this type.
That question is whether, looking at all the circumstances objectively, that is from the
perspective of a reasonable man in the position of the innocent party, the contract
breaker has clearly shown 
an intention to abandon and altogether refuse to perform the
contract. The answer given by a court to that question will depend very heavily on the
facts of the individual case (and it is this sensitivity to the facts which explains in part
why the cases are so difficult to reconcile). A court must therefore pay careful attention
to all the facts and circumstances of the individual case in so far as they bear on an
objective assessment of the intention of the contract breaker. Thus the motive of the
contract breaker may be taken into account if it reflects something of which the innocent
party was, or a reasonable person in his position would have been, aware and throws
light on the way the alleged repudiatory act would be viewed by such a reasonable
person.
In short, the difficulties in this area are said to lie in the application of the agreed test to
the facts of the individual case rather than in the formulation of the test itself. On the
facts of 
Eminence Property Developments Ltd
 
the Court of Appeal held that the vendors
had not committed a repudiatory breach of contract for the following reasons. First, the
vendors had been entitled to serve on the defaulting purchaser the notice to complete.
Secondly, the vendors had genuinely attempted to operate the notice provision but had
made a mistake in doing so, a fact which was obvious to the purchaser. Thirdly, neither
the purchaser nor his solicitors had taken the trouble to point out this clerical error to
the vendors and, further, they knew that, had they done so, the vendors would have
corrected the mistake and issued a notice which complied with the terms of the contract.
Given these factors it could not be said that it was the intention of the vendors to
abandon and altogether to refuse to perform the contract, particularly when account was
taken of the fact that the contract was highly advantageous to the vendors and was
onerous to the purchaser. It therefore followed that the vendors had not committed a
repudiatory breach of contract.
22.3.7
 
Some Comparative Reflections
English law in relation to termination for breach can be said to stand out from other
jurisdictions in two respects. First, it appears to place considerable emphasis upon the
importance of termination as a remedy. It is a significant remedy in practice (albeit not
as important as damages). In this respect it has a more prominent status than in other
systems where termination is seen as a secondary remedy or even as a remedy of last
resort. There is a difficult policy issue at stake here. What should be the aim of a
remedial regime for breach of contract? Should it be to encourage parties to continue
their relationship and resolve their difficulties or should it encourage parties to walk
away from a deal when things go wrong and seek performance elsewhere? English law
appears to tend towards the latter model (although it should be noted that a number of
the cases discussed in this chapter are shipping cases or cases of commodity sales where
the parties are often speculating on the movement of prices in the marketplace and, in
such a case, termination appears to be a more widely used remedy). Secondly, English
law places considerable emphasis on freedom of contract in the sense that it gives to
contracting parties substantial freedom to decide for themselves when the right to
terminate will arise (for example, it is open to the parties to classify any term they like as
a condition). Again, this is in contrast with some other systems where it is for the court
to decide whether or not the breach justifies termination.
Two instruments have been chosen for comparative purposes. The first is the Vienna
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the second is the
Principles of European Contract Law. Article 25 of the Vienna Convention provides:
A breach of contract committed by one of the parties is fundamental if it results in such detriment to the other
party as substantially to deprive him of what he is entitled to expect under the contract, unless the party in
breach did not foresee and a reasonable person of the same kind in the same circumstances would not have
foreseen such a result.
This provision appears to be similar to an intermediate term (although it is not
identical). As such it presents a difficulty for English lawyers because it appears to deny
to the parties the right to agree that any breach of a particular term shall give rise to a
right to terminate (in other words it appears not to recognize the existence of conditions,
at least party-created conditions). One reason for this may be that termination appears
to play a less important role in the remedial structure of the Convention. The remedial
regime is much more complex than that found in English law and it appears to give
greater emphasis to remedies that enable the parties to maintain their relationship (such
as the right to cure the breach and price reduction). It also places much more emphasis
on notification obligations before exercising the right to terminate the contract. For
example, in the case of non-delivery of the goods by the seller, the buyer is given the
right to fix an additional period of time of reasonable length for performance by the
(1)
(2)
(a)
(b)
(c)
seller of his obligations and, in the event that the seller fails to deliver the goods within
that additional period of time, the buyer is entitled to terminate the contract (see
Articles 47(1) and 49(1)). The difference between English law and the Convention is,
essentially, that English law makes greater provision for immediate termination upon
breach, whereas under the Convention a party may have to fix an additional period of
time for performance before resorting to the more drastic remedy of termination. The
difference between the two regimes is very much an issue of policy: should termination
be seen as a primary remedy or as a secondary remedy, only to be resorted to when
other remedies are unavailable or will not work?
The provisions of the Principles of European Contract Law appear to be somewhat
closer to English law. Article 9:301 deals with the right to terminate the contract and it
provides:
A party may terminate the contract if the other party’s non-performance is fundamental.
In the case of delay the aggrieved party may also terminate the contract under Article 8:106(3).
Article 8:103 defines fundamental non-performance in the following terms:
A non-performance of an obligation is fundamental to the contract if:
strict compliance with the obligation is of the essence of the contract; or
the non-performance substantially deprives the aggrieved party of what it was entitled to expect under
the contract, unless the other party did not foresee and could not reasonably have foreseen that result;
the non-performance is intentional and gives the aggrieved party reason to believe that it cannot rely on
the other party’s future performance.
To English eyes, this provision is very different from the Vienna Convention. The vital
difference is paragraph (a) which seems to approximate to a condition. It thus appears
to preserve the right of the parties to classify the status of the terms of their contract.
Paragraph (b) is much closer to an intermediate term, while paragraph (c) distinguishes
between intentional and unintentional non-performance (a distinction which is not
generally drawn in English law).
The Principles also contain a number of other provisions on the subject of breach (or
non-performance). Articles 8:104–8:106 provide:
8:104
 
Cure by Non-Performing Party
(1)
(2)
(1)
(2)
(3)
A party whose tender of performance is not accepted by the other party because it does not conform to the
contract may make a new and conforming tender where the time for performance has not yet arrived or the
delay would not be such as to constitute fundamental non-performance.
8:105
 
Assurance of Performance
A party which reasonably believes that there will be a fundamental non-performance by the other party
may demand adequate assurance of due performance and meanwhile may withhold performance of its
own obligations so long as such reasonable belief continues.
Where this assurance is not provided within a reasonable time, the party demanding it may terminate
the contract if it still reasonably believes that there will be a fundamental non-performance by the other
party and gives notice of termination without delay.
8:106
 
Notice Fixing Additional Period for Performance
In any case of non-performance the aggrieved party may by notice to the other party allow an additional
period of time for performance.
During the additional period the aggrieved party may withhold performance of its own reciprocal
obligations and may claim damages, but it may not resort to any other remedy. If it receives notice from
the other party that the latter will not perform within that period, or if upon expiry of that period due
performance has not been made, the aggrieved party may resort to any of the remedies that may be
available under 
chapter 9
 
[namely specific performance, withholding performance, termination of the
contract, price reduction, and damages and interest].
If in a case of delay in performance which is not fundamental the aggrieved party has given notice fixing
an additional period of time of reasonable length, it may terminate the contract at the end of the period
of notice. The aggrieved party may in its notice provide that if the other party does not perform within
the period fixed by the notice the contract shall terminate automatically. If the period stated is too short,
the aggrieved party may terminate, or, as the case may be, the contract shall terminate automatically,
only after a reasonable period from the time of the notice.
Article 8:105 is a helpful provision, which English law could usefully adopt. The right to
demand an assurance of performance is a useful right in the not uncommon case where
a contracting party has reason to believe that the other party will not perform his
contractual obligations.
22.4
 
Election
Must an innocent party exercise its right to terminate further performance of the
contract? The answer is that there is no obligation to exercise the right. A breach of
contract, even where it is repudiatory, does not of itself operate to bring the contract to
an end (even in the case of contracts of employment: 
Geys
 
v. 
Société Générale, London
Branch
 
[2012] UKSC 63, [2013] 1 AC 513). What it does is to confer on the innocent
party a choice. The innocent party can either choose to bring the contract to an end or he
can choose to affirm the contract and continue with performance. It is clearly not
possible both to affirm and to terminate and, this being the case, the innocent party
must decide which option it wishes to pursue. This choice on the part of the innocent
party is known as an election.
A party who wishes to exercise his right to terminate further performance of the contract
must generally notify the party in breach that he is doing so. This is known as
‘acceptance of the repudiation’. In 
Vitol SA
 
v. 
Norelf Ltd
 
[1996] AC 800, 810, Lord Steyn
stated:
An act of acceptance of a repudiation requires no particular form: a communication does not have to be couched
in the language of acceptance. It is sufficient that the communication or conduct clearly and unequivocally
conveys to the repudiating party that the aggrieved party is treating the contract as at an end.
As a general rule acceptance cannot take the form of silence, unless the only
construction that can be put upon the conduct of the parties is that one party has
accepted the other’s repudiatory breach of contract. For example, a contractor who does
not turn up for work after having been told by the employer, in breach of contract, to get
off the site is likely to be held to have accepted the employer’s repudiatory breach.
However, even in such a case, a contractor who sought legal advice would be told to
communicate to the employer his acceptance of the latter’s repudiatory breach. Given
the general rule that silence does not amount to acceptance, a party in the position of the
contractor would be advised to avoid any doubt and make his acceptance of the
repudiation clear and unequivocal because a failure to do so may persuade a court to
conclude that there was no effective acceptance of the breach (
Vitol SA
 
v. 
Beta
Renowable Group SA
 
[2017] EWHC 1734 (Comm), [2017] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 338).
Acceptance of a repudiatory breach of contract operates to bring the contract between
the parties to an end. Termination operates prospectively, but not retrospectively. Thus
termination operates to release both parties from their future obligations to perform
their primary obligations under the contract, but it leaves intact rights which have
accrued prior to the termination of the contract (
Photo Production Ltd
 
v. 
Securicor
Transport Ltd
 
[1980] AC 827). In this sense termination for breach differs from
rescission of the contract for misrepresentation (see 
17.4.1
). Rescission for
misrepresentation sets aside a contract for all purposes (that is to say the contract is set
aside both retrospectively and prospectively). Termination for breach, by contrast, does
not have retrospective effect: there is no attempt to unwind the contract. Indeed, it is
possible for a term in a contract to survive termination. Where the parties intend the
clause to survive termination then the courts will generally give effect to that intention.
Clauses that generally survive termination are arbitration clauses (see 
Heyman
 
v.
Darwins Ltd
 
[1942] AC 356) and, possibly, confidentiality clauses (
Campbell
 
v. 
Frisbee
[2002] EWCA Civ 1374, [2003] ICR 141).
22.5
 
Loss of The Right To Terminate
The right to terminate the contract will generally be lost if the innocent party decides to
affirm the contract. When deciding whether conduct amounts to an affirmation, a court
is not conducting a ‘mechanical exercise’ but is exercising a judgment and, in the
exercise of that judgment it should not adopt an unduly technical approach (
White
Rosebay Shipping SA
 
v. 
Hong Kong Chain Glory Shipping Ltd (The Fortune Plum)
[2013] EWHC 1355 (Comm), [2013] 2 All ER (Comm) 449, [38]). Affirmation must
generally be unequivocal. The mere fact that the innocent party has called on the party
in breach to perform his contractual obligations does not necessarily constitute
affirmation. As Moore-Bick J stated in 
Yukong Line Ltd of Korea
 
v. 
Rendsberg
Investments Corpn of Liberia
 
[1996] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 604, 608, ‘the law does not require
an injured party to snatch at a repudiation and he does not automatically lose his right
to treat the contract as discharged merely by calling on the other to reconsider his
position and recognize his obligation.’ But the innocent party must proceed with great
caution because the choice between affirmation and termination, once made, is, in
principle, irrevocable. As a general rule a party will not be held to have affirmed the
contract unless he had knowledge of the facts giving rise to the breach and he knew of
his right to choose between affirmation and termination.
It is sometimes said that there is no ‘middle way’ or ‘third choice’ open to the innocent
party (
Bentsen
 
v. 
Taylor
 
[1893] 2 QB 274, 279 and 
Fercometal SARL
 
v. 
Mediterranean
Shipping Co SA
 
[1989] AC 788, 799–801): he must make his choice between
termination and affirmation. This is true in the sense that there is no ‘third choice, as a
sort of via media, to affirm the contract and yet be absolved from tendering further
performance unless and until [the breaching party] gives reasonable notice that he is
once again able and willing to perform’ (
Fercometal SARL
 
v. 
Mediterranean Shipping
Co SA
 
[1989] AC 788, 801). But the proposition that there is no middle way can be
overstated. There is a sense in which there is a middle way open to the innocent party in
that it is given a period of time in which to make up its mind whether it is going to affirm
the contract or terminate it. The Court of Appeal so concluded in 
Stocznia Gdanska SA
v. 
Latvian Shipping Company (No 2)
 
[2002] EWCA Civ 889, [2002] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 436.
The decision in 
Stocznia Gdanska SA
 
is a welcome recognition of the fact that a
repudiatory breach of contract can often put the innocent party in a difficult position.
He may well be reluctant to terminate the contract as a result of the breach given the
extent of his commitment to the relationship. On the other hand, he may be reluctant to
affirm the contract given that an affirmation, once communicated, is, in principle,
irrevocable. The Court of Appeal in 
Stocznia Gdanska
 
recognized that there is, in effect,
a third option open to the innocent party in the sense that he has a period of time in
which to decide whether to terminate or affirm. Rix LJ stated (at [87]):
In my judgment, there is of course a middle ground between acceptance of repudiation and affirmation of the
contract, and that is the period when the innocent party is making up his mind what to do. If he does nothing
for too long, there may come a time when the law will treat him as having affirmed. If he maintains the contract
in being for the moment, while reserving his right to treat it as repudiated if his contract partner persists in his
repudiation, then he has not yet elected. As long as the contract remains alive, the innocent party runs the risk
that a merely anticipatory repudiatory breach, a thing ‘writ in water’ until acceptance, can be overtaken by
another event which prejudices the innocent party’s rights under the 
contract—such as frustration or even his
own breach. He also runs the risk, if that is the right word, that the party in repudiation will resume
performance of the contract and thus end any continuing right in the innocent party to elect to accept the
former repudiation as terminating the contract.
This is a welcome recognition of commercial reality, namely that parties do require a
period of time in which to make up their minds. The length of that period will very much
depend upon the facts of the case and the nature of the contract. Where time is of the
essence of the contract or the contract has been entered into in a volatile market, the
time allowed is likely to be relatively short. But where there is no particular urgency, or
the situation is a complex one, the innocent party may be given a longer period of time
in which to make up its mind (
Force India Formula One Team Ltd
 
v. 
Etihad Airways
PJSC
 
[2010] EWCA Civ 1051, [2011] ETMR 10).
A party who wishes to call upon the other party to perform but who does not wish such
action to be construed as an affirmation of the contract would be well advised expressly
to reserve his contractual rights. The innocent party in 
Stocznia Gdanska
 
did not do so
and this almost persuaded Rix LJ to conclude that it had affirmed the contract. But, at
the end of the day, he was prepared to uphold the finding of the trial judge to the effect
that there had been no affirmation.
There is one major exception to the general rule that an election, once made, is
irrevocable. This exception arises in the context of continuing repudiatory conduct by
the party in breach. In such a case an innocent party who has elected to affirm the
contract after the first breach of contract may be able to treat the continued non-
performance as a fresh act of repudiation (see 
Johnson
 
v. 
Agnew
 
[1980] AC 367 and
Safehaven
 
v. 
Springbok
 
(1998) 71 P & CR 59). Once a repudiation is spent there cannot
be an acceptance of the breach but if there is a continued refusal to perform by the party
in breach and that continued refusal amounts to further repudiatory conduct, the
innocent party is entitled to bring the contract to an end notwithstanding the initial
affirmation (
White Rosebay Shipping SA
 
v. 
Hong Kong Chain Glory Shipping Ltd (The
Fortune Plum)
 
[2013] EWHC 1355 (Comm), [2013] 2 All ER (Comm) 449, [50]). Were
the law otherwise an innocent party would have to continue performing his obligations
even in the case where it is clear from the continued refusal to perform that the party in
breach would never do so.
22.6
 
Anticipatory Breach
It sometimes happens that, before the time fixed for performance under the contract,
one party informs the other that he will not or cannot perform his obligations under the
contract or that he intends to carry out his obligations in a way that is not consistent
with the terms of the contract. This is known as an anticipatory breach of contract. What
is the effect in law of an anticipatory breach of contract? One response would be to say
that it has no effect at all. The time for performance has not yet arisen and one cannot be
in breach of contract prior to the time for performance. But such a view presents
difficulties for both parties. As far as the innocent party is concerned it leaves him in a
state of some uncertainty. Will he receive the promised performance? Should he seek
alternative performance elsewhere? The party who has committed the anticipatory
breach also has an interest in effect being given to his renunciation. One reason why a
party who is unable to perform may inform the other party prior to the time for
performance is that he wishes to give the other party the opportunity to find alternative
performance elsewhere. The effect of advance notice may well be to reduce 
the losses of
the innocent party and the non-performing party has an obvious interest in reducing his
potential exposure to a damages claim. The alternative response is to regard the
intimation of the refusal to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract as a
breach of contract which immediately gives the innocent party access to the usual array
of remedies for breach.
The choice was made by the English courts in 
Hochster
 
v. 
De la Tour
 
(1853) 2 E & B
678. The defendant entered into an agreement with the plaintiff under which he agreed
to employ the plaintiff as his courier for three months. The commencement date was
agreed as 1 June 1852. On 11 May 1852 the defendant wrote to the plaintiff, informing
him that his services were no longer required. On 22 May the plaintiff brought an action
for damages against the defendant. The claim succeeded notwithstanding the fact that it
was brought before the time fixed for performance under the contract. 
Hochster
 
was
followed some years later in 
Frost
 
v. 
Knight
 
(1872) LR 7 Ex 111. The defendant promised
to marry the plaintiff on the death of his father (his father objected to the marriage). The
defendant broke off the engagement while his father was still alive. The plaintiff brought
an action against the defendant for breach of his promise to marry her (at this time
promises to marry were legally enforceable). The defendant defended the claim on the
ground that no claim for breach of contract could be brought while his father was still
alive. The plaintiff succeeded in her claim. Cockburn CJ stated (at p. 114) that:
[i]t is true … that there can be no actual breach of a contract by reason of non-performance so long as the time
for performance has not yet arrived. But, on the other hand, there is—and the decision in 
Hochster
 
v. 
De la
Tour
 
proceeds on that assumption—a breach of the contract when the promisor repudiates it and declares he
will no longer be bound by it. The promisee has an inchoate right to the performance of the bargain, which
becomes complete when the time for performance has arrived. In the mean time he has a right to have the
contract kept open as a subsisting and effective contract. Its unimpaired and unimpeached efficacy may be
essential to his interests. His rights acquired under it may be dealt by him in various ways for his benefit and
advantage. Of such advantage the repudiation of the contract by the other party, and the announcement that it
never will be fulfilled, must of course deprive him. It is therefore quite right to hold that such an announcement
amounts to a violation of the contract in omnibus, and that upon it the promisee, if so minded, may at once
treat it as a breach of the entire contract, and bring his action accordingly.
It is therefore clear law that an anticipatory breach of contract gives to the innocent
party an immediate cause of action; he is not required to wait for the time for
performance. The innocent party can seek a remedy immediately or can choose to affirm
the contract and wait for the time for performance. The remedies available to the
innocent party at the time of the anticipatory breach will depend upon the nature of the
breach. If the anticipatory breach is a repudiatory breach of contract then the innocent
party can terminate the contract and seek damages to compensate him for the loss of his
bargain. Most anticipatory breaches are repudiatory breaches because they take the
form of a clear and unequivocal statement that performance will not be forthcoming.
Where the innocent party decides to terminate further performance of the contract on
account of the anticipatory breach, he must ‘accept’ the breach and inform the other
party of his decision to terminate. But he need not accept the breach. He can elect to
affirm the contract and to wait for the time for performance. In such a case the contract
remains alive for the benefit of both parties so that the innocent party must continue
with the performance 
of his own obligations under the contract (see 
Fercometal SARL
 
v.
Mediterranean Shipping Co SA
 
[1989] AC 788). Similarly, the innocent party has no
cause of action where he chooses to affirm the contract and, prior to the time for
performance, the contract is frustrated. In such a case the contract remains alive after
the anticipatory breach and is terminated not by the breach but by the operation of the
doctrine of frustration (
Avery
 
v. 
Bowden
 
(1855) 5 E & B 714).
The right of the innocent party to affirm the contract and continue with performance is,
however, a source of considerable controversy. The source of the controversy can be
traced back to the following decision of the House of Lords:
WHITE AND CARTER (COUNCILS) LTD V. MCGREGOR
[1962] AC 413, House of Lords
In 1954 the parties entered into a contract under which the appellant advertising
contractors agreed to display advertisements on local authority litter bins for the
respondent’s garage for a three-year period. The contract was renewed for a
further three-year period in 1957. On the day that the renewal contract was
concluded the respondent wrote to the appellants, seeking to cancel the contract
on the ground that his sales manager, who concluded the contract on the
respondent’s behalf, had no specific authority to make the contract. The appellants
refused to accept the respondent’s cancellation and continued with performance of
the contract and they displayed the advertisements on the litter bins in accordance
with the terms of the contract. The respondent refused to pay for the
advertisements. The appellants sued for the full sum due under the contract for the
period of three years. The claim was brought pursuant to clause 8 of the contract
which provided:
‘In the event of an instalment or part thereof being due for payment, and
remaining unpaid for a period of four weeks or in the event of the advertiser being
in any way in breach of this contract then the whole amount due for the 156 weeks
or such part of the said 156 weeks as the advertiser shall not yet have paid shall
immediately become due and payable.’
The respondent maintained that he was not liable to pay the sum alleged to be
due on the ground that he had repudiated the contract before anything had been
done under it so that the appellants were not entitled to continue with performance
and sue for the price.
The House of Lords held by a majority (Lord Morton of Henryton and Lord Keith
of Avonholm dissenting) that the appellants were entitled to recover the contract
price on the ground that the respondent’s unaccepted repudiation of the contract
had not operated to terminate the contract between the parties. The appellants
were therefore entitled to continue with performance of the contract and recover
the contract price.
Lord Reid
[set out the facts and, having set out the terms of clause 8, continued]
A question was debated whether this clause provides a penalty or liquidated
damages, but on the view which I take of the case it need not be pursued. The
clause merely provides for acceleration of payment of the stipulated price if the
advertiser fails to pay an instalment timeously. As the respondent maintained that
he was not bound by the contract he did not pay the first instalment within the time
allowed. Accordingly, if the appellants were entitled to carry out their part of the
contract notwithstanding the respondent’s repudiation, it was 
hardly disputed that
this clause entitled them to sue immediately for the whole price and not merely the
first instalment.
The general rule cannot be in doubt. It was settled in Scotland at least as early
as 1848 and it has been authoritatively stated time and again in both Scotland and
England. If one party to a contract repudiates it in the sense of making it clear to
the other party that he refuses or will refuse to carry out his part of the contract, the
other party, the innocent party, has an option. He may accept that repudiation and
sue for damages for breach of contract, whether or not the time for performance
has come; or he may if he chooses disregard or refuse to accept it and then the
contract remains in full effect.
[He considered the case of 
Howie
 
v. 
Anderson
 
(1848) 10 D 355 and continued]
I need not refer to the numerous authorities. They are not disputed by the
respondent but he points out that in all of them the party who refused to accept the
repudiation had no active duties under the contract. The innocent party’s option is
generally said to be to wait until the date of performance and then to claim
damages estimated as at that date. There is no case in which it is said that he
may, in face of the repudiation, go on and incur useless expense in performing the
contract and then claim the contract price. The option, it is argued, is merely as to
the date as at which damages are to be assessed.
Developing this argument, the respondent points out that in most cases the
innocent party cannot complete the contract himself without the other party doing,
allowing or accepting something, and that it is purely fortuitous that the appellants
can do so in this case. In most cases by refusing co-operation the party in breach
can compel the innocent party to restrict his claim to damages. Then it was said
that, even where the innocent party can complete the contract without such co-
operation, it is against the public interest that he should be allowed to do so. An
example was developed in argument. A company might engage an expert to go
abroad and prepare an elaborate report and then repudiate the contract before
anything was done. To allow such an expert then to waste thousands of pounds in
preparing the report cannot be right if a much smaller sum of damages would give
him full compensation for his loss. It would merely enable the expert to extort a
settlement giving him far more than reasonable compensation.
[He then considered the case of 
Langford & Co
 
v. 
Dutch
, 1952 SC 15 (a case in
which an advertising contractor who had agreed to exhibit a film was held not to be
entitled to refuse to accept the repudiation of the contract, exhibit the film and claim
the contract price) and continued]
We must now decide whether that case was rightly decided. In my judgment it
was not. It could only be supported on one or other of two grounds. It might be said
that, because in most cases the circumstances are such that an innocent party is
unable to complete the contract and earn the contract price without the assent or
co-operation of the other party, therefore in cases where he can do so he should
not be allowed to do so. I can see no justification for that.
The other ground would be that there is some general equitable principle or
element of public policy which requires this limitation of the contractual rights of the
innocent party. It may well be that, if it can be shown that a person has no
legitimate interest, financial or otherwise, in performing the contract rather than
claiming damages, he ought not to be allowed to saddle the other party with an
additional burden with no benefit to himself. If a party has no interest to enforce a
stipulation, he cannot in general enforce it: so it might be said that, if a party has no
interest to insist on a particular remedy, he ought not to be allowed to insist on it.
And, just as a party is not allowed to enforce a penalty, so he ought not to be
allowed to penalise the other party by taking one course when another is equally
advantageous to him. If I may revert to the example which I gave of a company
engaging an expert to prepare an 
elaborate report and then repudiating before
anything was done, it might be that the company could show that the expert had
no substantial or legitimate interest in carrying out the work rather than accepting
damages: I would think that the de minimis principle would apply in determining
whether his interest was substantial, and that he might have a legitimate interest
other than an immediate financial interest. But if the expert had no such interest
then that might be regarded as a proper case for the exercise of the general
equitable jurisdiction of the court. But that is not this case. Here the respondent did
not set out to prove that the appellants had no legitimate interest in completing the
contract and claiming the contract price rather than claiming damages; there is
nothing in the findings of fact to support such a case, and it seems improbable that
any such case could have been proved. It is, in my judgment, impossible to say
that the appellants should be deprived of their right to claim the contract price
merely because the benefit to them, as against claiming damages and re-letting
their advertising space, might be small in comparison with the loss to the
respondent: that is the most that could be said in favour of the respondent.
Parliament has on many occasions relieved parties from certain kinds of
improvident or oppressive contracts, but the common law can only do that in very
limited circumstances. Accordingly, I am unable to avoid the conclusion that this
appeal must be allowed and the case remitted so that decree can be pronounced
as craved in the initial writ.
Lord Morton of Henryton
[dissenting]
My Lords, I think that this is a case of great importance, although the claim is
for a comparatively small sum. If the appellants are right, strange consequences
follow in any case in which, under a repudiated contract, services are to be
performed by the party who has not repudiated it, so long as he is able to perform
these services without the co-operation of the repudiating party. Many examples of
such contracts could be given. One, given in the course of the argument and
already mentioned by my noble and learned friend, Lord Reid, is the engagement
of an expert to go abroad and write a report on some subject for a substantial fee
plus his expenses. If the appellants succeed in the present case, it must follow that
the expert is entitled to incur the expense of going abroad, to write his unwanted
report, and then to recover the fee and expenses, even if the other party has
plainly repudiated the contract before any expense has been incurred.
It is well established that repudiation by one party does not put an end to a
contract. The other party can say ‘I hold you to your contract, which still remains in
force’. What then is his remedy if the repudiating party persists in his repudiation
and refuses to carry out his part of the contract? The contract has been broken.
The innocent party is entitled to be compensated by damages for any loss which
he has suffered by reason of the breach, and in a limited class of cases the court
will decree specific implement. The law of Scotland provides no other remedy for a
breach of contract and there is no reported case which decides that the innocent
party may act as the appellants have acted. The present case is one in which
specific implement could not be decreed, since the only obligation of the
respondent under the contract was to pay a sum of money for services to be
rendered by the appellants. Yet the appellants are claiming a kind of inverted
specific implement of the contract. They first insist on performing their part of the
contract, against the will of the other party, and then claim that he must perform his
part and pay the contract price for unwanted services. In my opinion, my Lords, the
appellants’ only remedy was damages, and they were bound to take steps to
minimise their loss, according to a well-established rule of law. Far from doing this,
having incurred no expense at the date of the repudiation, they made no attempt to
procure another 
advertiser, but deliberately went on to incur expense and perform
unwanted services with the intention of creating a money debt which did not exist
at the date of the repudiation …
In my opinion, the appellants’ alternative claim for the same sum of £196 4s. as
liquidated damages should be rejected for the reasons which will shortly be given
by my noble and learned friend, Lord Keith of Avonholm.
I would dismiss the appeal.
Lord Tucker
My Lords, I have had the advantage of reading the opinion prepared by my noble
and learned friend, Lord Hodson. I am in complete agreement with the reasons he
gives for allowing the appeal.
Lord Keith of Avonholm
[dissenting]
I find the argument advanced for the appellants a somewhat startling one. If it is
right it would seem that a man who has contracted to go to Hong Kong at his own
expense and make a report, in return for remuneration of £10,000, and who,
before the date fixed for the start of the journey and perhaps before he has
incurred any expense, is informed by the other contracting party that he has
cancelled or repudiates the contract, is entitled to set off for Hong Kong and
produce his report in order to claim in debt the stipulated sum. Such a result is not,
in my opinion, in accordance with principle or authority, and cuts across the rule
that where one party is in breach of contract the other must take steps to minimise
the loss sustained by the breach …
I would dismiss the appeal.
Lord Hodson
It is settled as a fundamental rule of the law of contract that repudiation by one of
the parties to a contract does not itself discharge it. See Viscount Simon’s speech
in 
Heyman
 
v. 
Darwins Ltd
 
[1942] AC 356, 361, citing with approval the following
sentence from a judgment of Scrutton LJ in 
Golding
 
v.

(1932) 43 Ll L Rep 487, 488: ‘I have never been able to
understand what effect the repudiation of one party has unless the other party
accepts the repudiation’.
In 
Howard
 
v. 
Pickford Tool Co Ltd
 
[1951] 1 KB 417, 421 Asquith LJ said: ‘An
unaccepted repudiation is a thing writ in water and of no value to anybody: it
confers no legal rights of any sort or kind’. These are English cases but that the
law of Scotland is the same is, I think, clear from the authorities, of which I need
only refer to one, namely, 
Howie
 
v. 
Anderson
, 10 D 355 where language to the
same effect is to be found in the opinions of the Lord President and Lord Moncrieff.
It follows that, if, as here, there was no acceptance, the contract remains alive
for the benefit of both parties and the party who has repudiated can change his
mind but it does not follow that the party at the receiving end of the proffered
repudiation is bound to accept it before the time for performance and is left to his
remedy in damages for breach.
Counsel for the respondent did not seek to dispute the general proposition of
law to which I have referred but sought to argue that if at the date of performance
by the innocent party the guilty party maintains his refusal to accept performance
and the innocent party does not accept the repudiation, although the contract still
survives, it does not survive so far as the 
right of the innocent party to perform it is
concerned but survives only for the purpose of enforcing remedies open to him by
way of damages or specific implement. This produces an impossible result; if the
innocent party is deprived of some of his rights it involves putting an end to the
contract except in cases, unlike this, where, in the exercise of the court’s
discretion, the remedy of specific implement is available.
The true position is that the contract survives and does so not only where
specific implement is available. When the assistance of the court is not required
the innocent party can choose whether he will accept repudiation and sue for
damages for anticipatory breach or await the date of performance by the guilty
party. Then, if there is failure in performance, his rights are preserved.
It may be unfortunate that the appellants have saddled themselves with an
unwanted contract causing an apparent waste of time and money. No doubt this
aspect impressed the Court of Session but there is no equity which can assist the
respondent. It is trite that equity will not rewrite an improvident contract where
there is no disability on either side. There is no duty laid upon a party to a
subsisting contract to vary it at the behest of the other party so as to deprive
himself of the benefit given to him by the contract. To hold otherwise would be to
introduce a novel equitable doctrine that a party was not to be held to his contract
unless the court in a given instance thought it reasonable so to do. In this case it
would make an action for debt a claim for a discretionary remedy. This would
introduce an uncertainty into the field of contract which appears to be unsupported
by authority either in English or Scottish law save for the one case upon which the
Court of Session founded its opinion and which must, in my judgment, be taken to
have been wrongly decided …
I would allow the appeal.
Commentary
A vital key to understanding the issue in 
White & Carter
 
is the distinction between a
claim in debt and a claim in damages. A claim in debt is a claim that the debtor owes to
the creditor a liquidated sum of money. Such a claim is not subject to the requirement
that the creditor must have mitigated his loss. Either the debtor owes the sum of money
to the creditor or he does not. A claim in damages, on the other hand, is an unliquidated
claim to be compensated for the loss that the innocent party has suffered as a result of
the breach of contract. A claimant who brings a claim for damages is under a ‘duty’ to
mitigate his loss, in the sense that he cannot recover that portion of his loss that is
attributable to his failure to mitigate (see further 
23.8.2
). Thus the classification of the
claim, as either a claim in debt or in damages, was important to the outcome of the case.
Had it been a claim in damages, the appellants would have been subject to a
requirement that they take reasonable steps to mitigate their loss (through seeking to
find other people to take over the advertising space vacated by the respondent). But the
claim was held to be one in debt. Clause 8 of the contract was critical in reaching the
conclusion that the claim was one in debt because the effect of the clause was to declare
that the entire price for the three-year period was ‘immediately due and payable’. The
claim was therefore for a debt that was owed rather than for the loss of an entitlement to
an income stream over a period of years. The obligation to mitigate was therefore not in
play.
The majority comprised Lord Hodson, Lord Tucker, and Lord Reid. For Lord Hodson
this was a claim in debt and a claim in debt could not be turned into a discretionary
remedy. It should be noted that Lord Tucker agreed with Lord Hodson and did not
express 
his agreement with the speech of Lord Reid. Lord Reid’s speech differed from
that of Lord Hodson in that he introduced the ‘legitimate interest’ test (in that he held
that it was open to the respondent to seek to show that the appellants had no legitimate
interest in continuing with performance of the contract). The question which then arose
was whether or not this was part of the 
ratio
 
of the case. In 
Hounslow London Borough
Council
 
v. 
Twickenham Garden Developments Ltd
 
[1971] Ch 233, 254 Megarry J stated:
‘it seems to me that the ratio of the 
White
 
case involves acceptance of Lord Reid’s
limitations, even though Lord Tucker and Lord Hodson said nothing of them: for
without Lord Reid there was no majority for the decision of the House. Under the
doctrine of precedent, I do not think that it can be said that a majority of a bare majority
is itself the majority.’
The decision in 
White & Carter
 
has proved to be extremely controversial (see generally
Q Liu, ‘The 
White & Carter
 
Principle: A Restatement’ (2011) 74 
MLR
 
171). It has been
attacked on the ground that it was unfair to the respondent in that it saddled him with a
performance which he did not want. It has also been argued that it leads to a result
which is economically inefficient in that performance was a waste (although on the facts
it could be argued that the respondent did derive at least some benefit from the
advertisement of his garage on the litter bins). In subsequent cases courts have generally
chosen to interpret the case narrowly and they have done so by developing the two
exceptions to the rule recognized in the speeches in 
White & Carter
. The first exception
is that the rule does not apply where the innocent party is dependent upon the co-
operation of the party in breach in order to be able to continue with performance. The
second exception arises where the innocent party has no legitimate interest in
performance of the contract.
First, the rule in 
White & Carter
 
does not apply where the innocent party is dependent
upon the co-operation of the party in breach in order to be able to continue with
performance. The innocent party cannot get an order of the court requiring the party in
breach to co-operate with a performance which he no longer wants. In such a case the
innocent party must be content with a claim in damages which, of course, is subject to
the mitigation rule. Further, the courts have adopted a broad notion of co-operation so
that the innocent party can neither require the active nor the passive co-operation of the
party in breach. In 
Hounslow London Borough Council
 
v. 
Twickenham Garden
Developments Ltd
 
Megarry J stated (at pp. 253–254):
Suppose that A, who owns a large and valuable painting, contracts with B, a picture restorer, to restore it over a
period of three months. Before the work is begun, A receives a handsome offer from C to purchase the picture,
subject to immediate delivery of the picture in its unrestored state, C having grave suspicions of B’s competence.
If the work of restoration is to be done in A’s house, he can effectually exclude B by refusing to admit him to the
house; without A’s ‘co-operation’ to this extent B cannot perform his contract. But what if the picture stands in
A’s locked barn, the key of which he has lent to B so that he may come and go freely, or if the picture has been
removed to B’s premises? Can B insist in these cases in performing his contract, even though this makes it
impossible for A to accept C’s offer? In the case of the barn A’s co-operation may perhaps be said to be requisite
to the extent of not barring B’s path to the barn or putting another lock on the door; but if the picture is on B’s
premises, no active co-operation by A is needed. Nevertheless, the picture is A’s property, and I find it difficult
to believe that Lord Reid intended to restrict the concept of ‘co-operation’ to active co-operation. In the 
White
case, no co-operation by the proprietor, either active or passive, was required; the contract could be performed
by the agent wholly without reference to the proprietor or his property. The case was far removed from that of a
property owner being 
forced to stand impotently aside while a perhaps ill-advised contract is executed on
property of his which he has delivered into the possession of the other party, and is powerless to retrieve.
The principle underlying the co-operation exception was further considered by Nicholas
Strauss QC, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, in 
Ministry of Sound (Ireland)
Ltd
 
v. 
World Online Ltd
 
[2003] EWHC 2178 (Ch), [2003] 2 All ER (Comm) 823. He
stated (at [49]) that:
in essence, the principle is that the breach of contract does not convert a dependent obligation into an
independent one; if the right to the payment claimed is dependent upon the performance of contractual
obligations, the prevention of performance by the other party’s breach of contract does not alter the position.
It is therefore crucial to examine the precise scope of the contractual right to payment.
Where the right to payment is dependent upon performance by the innocent party of his
contractual obligations, and the innocent party has been unable to perform these
obligations as a result of the lack of co-operation from the breaching party, the innocent
party will not be entitled to claim payment under the contract because the right to
payment has not arisen. On the other hand, where the right to payment is not dependent
upon performance by the innocent party of his contractual obligations, then the
innocent party should be entitled to claim payment in accordance with the contract
provided that any conditions which entitle him to payment have been satisfied.
The other exception is the ‘legitimate interest’ requirement to be found in the speech of
Lord Reid in 
White & Carter
. Lord Reid stated that the exception was inapplicable on
the facts of 
White & Carter
 
on the ground that the respondent had not set out to prove
that the appellants had no legitimate interest in completing the contract and claiming
the contract price rather than claiming damages. It is hardly surprising that the
respondent did not make such an attempt given that he presumably did not know that
he had such an option open to him until Lord Reid told him that he did. But breaching
parties in later cases have been quick to seize on the exception and exploit it to the full.
They have generally found the courts to be receptive to arguments based on the
exception.
In 
Attica Sea Carriers Corporation
 
v. 
Ferrostaal Poseidon Bulk Reederei GmbH (The
Puerto Buitrago)
 
[1976] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 250 charterers chartered a vessel from
shipowners for 17 months. After six months the vessel required substantial repairs. The
cost of these repairs was some $2 million. But the vessel was not worth repairing
because, even when it was fully repaired, it would be worth only $1 million. In these
circumstances the charterers terminated the charter hire and re-delivered the vessel.
The charterers admitted liability for $400,000 of the repairs but the shipowners refused
to accept the re-delivery of the vessel, contending that the charterers were liable under
the contract to pay the hire until the repairs had been carried out. The Court of Appeal
rejected the shipowner’s argument, holding that the obligation to repair the vessel was
not a condition precedent to the entitlement of the charterer to redeliver the vessel. It
was therefore not necessary for the Court of Appeal to decide whether or not the
shipowners were entitled to recover the hire until such time as the repairs were done.
But the court nevertheless gave brief consideration to the issue. It was held that 
White &
Carter
 
was distinguishable. Lord Denning MR expressed himself in characteristically
robust terms. After noting that the decision in 
White & Carter
 
had been said by one
leading textbook writer to give rise to a ‘grotesque’ result, he continued as follows (at p.
255):
Even though it was a Scots case, it would appear that the House of Lords, as at present constituted, would
expect us to follow it in any case that is precisely on all fours with it. But I would not follow it otherwise. It has
no application whatever in a case where the plaintiff ought, in all reason, to accept the repudiation and sue for
damages—provided that damages would provide an adequate remedy for any loss suffered by him. The reason is
because, by suing for the money, the plaintiff is seeking to enforce specific performance of the contract—and he
should not be allowed to do so when damages would be an adequate remedy. Take a servant, who has a contract
for six months certain, but is dismissed after one month. He cannot sue for his wages for each of the six months
by alleging that he was ready and willing to serve. His only remedy is damages. Take a finance company which
lets a machine or motor-car on hire purchase, but the hirer refuses to accept it. The finance company cannot sue
each month for the instalments. Its only remedy is in damages. … So here, when the charterers tendered
redelivery at the end of the period of the charter—in breach of the contract to repair—the shipowners ought in
all reason to have accepted it. They cannot sue for specific performance—either of the promise to pay the
charter hire, or of the promise to do the repairs—because damages are an adequate remedy for the breach.
Orr LJ was rather more circumspect. He distinguished 
White & Carter
 
on the ground
that the shipowners could not fulfil the contract without any co-operation from the
charterers and also because the charterers had set out to show that the shipowners had
no legitimate interest in continuing with performance of the contract. Browne LJ
concurred with both judgments.
In 
Gator Shipping Corporation
 
v. 
Trans-Asiatic Oil Ltd SA and Occidental Shipping
Establishment (The Odenfield)
 
[1978] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 357, 373–374 Kerr J adopted a less
restrictive approach to the scope of 
White & Carter
. He considered 
The Puerto Buitrago
and stated (at p. 373) that he did not
regard the case as any authority for a general proposition to the effect that whenever a charterer repudiates a
time or demise charter, for whatever reason and in whatever circumstances, the owners are always bound to
take the vessel back, because a refusal to do so would be equivalent to seeking an order for specific performance.
The consequences of such a proposition would be extremely serious in many cases, and no trace of such a
doctrine is to be found in our shipping law. But no such general proposition was laid down. … It follows that any
fetter on the innocent party’s right of election whether or not to accept a repudiation will only be applied in
extreme cases, viz where damages would be an adequate remedy 
and
 
where an election to keep the contract
alive would be wholly unreasonable. [Emphasis in the original.]
The next case is the decision of Lloyd J in 
Clea Shipping Corporation
 
v. 
Bulk Oil
International Ltd (The Alaskan Trader)
 
[1984] 1 All ER 129. The defendant shipowners
chartered a vessel to the plaintiff charterers for approximately twenty-four months.
After almost a year of largely trouble-free use, the vessel suffered a serious engine
breakdown which necessitated repairs that would take several months to complete. In
these circumstances the plaintiffs informed the defendants that they had no further use
for the vessel but the defendants nevertheless proceeded to carry out the repairs at a
cost of some £800,000. On completion of the repairs the defendants informed the
plaintiffs that the vessel was once again at their disposal. However, the plaintiffs were of
the view that the charterparty had come to an end and so they refused to give any
directions to the master of the vessel. The defendants nevertheless 
refused to accept that
the charter was at an end and kept the vessel, fully manned, at the disposal of the
plaintiffs. The plaintiffs, having paid the hire for the entire period, sought to recover the
hire paid for the period after the breakdown of the vessel. It was held that the plaintiffs
were entitled to recover the hire subject to their liability in damages for the loss caused
by their refusal to take the vessel. On the facts Lloyd J concluded that the owners had no
legitimate interest in claiming the hire rather than pursuing a claim for damages. He
considered the authorities and concluded (at pp. 136–137):
Whether one takes Lord Reid’s language, which was adopted by Orr and Browne LJJ in 
The Puerto Buitrago
, or
Lord Denning’s language in that case (‘in all reason’), or Kerr J’s language in 
The Odenfield
 
(‘wholly
unreasonable … quite unrealistic, unreasonable and untenable’) there comes a point at which the court will
cease, on general equitable principles, to allow the innocent party to enforce his contract according to its strict
legal terms. How one defines that point is obviously a matter of some difficulty, for it involves drawing a line
between conduct which is merely unreasonable … and conduct which is 
wholly
 
unreasonable. … But however
difficult it may be to define the point, that there is such a point seems to me to have been accepted both by the
Court of Appeal in 
The Puerto Buitrago
 
and by Kerr J in 
The Odenfield
.
The penultimate case is the decision of Simon J in 
Ocean Marine Navigation Ltd
 
v.
Koch Carbon Inc (The ‘Dynamic’)
 
[2003] EWHC 1936 (Comm), [2003] 2 Lloyd’s Rep
693. He concluded that the ‘qualifying word 
wholly
 
in the expression 
wholly
unreasonable
 
in 
The Odenfield
 
properly emphasizes that the rule is general and the
exception only applies in extreme cases’ and ‘adds nothing to the test’. He sought to
summarize the current state of the law in the following propositions:
These cases establish the following exception to the general rule that the innocent party has an option whether
or not to accept a repudiation: (i) The burden is on the 
contract-breaker
 
to show that the innocent party has no
legitimate interest in performing the contract rather than claiming damages. (ii) This burden is not discharged
merely by showing that the benefit to the other party is small in comparison to the loss to the contract breaker.
(iii) The exception to the general rule applies only in extreme cases where damages would be an adequate
remedy and where an election to keep the contract alive would be unreasonable.
Finally, in 
Isabella Shipowner Ltd
 
v. 
Shagang Shipping Co Ltd (The Aquafaith)
 
[2012]
EWHC 1077 (Comm), [2012] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 61 Cooke J attempted a further summary of
the law when he stated (at [44]) that ‘the effect of the authorities is that an innocent
party will have no legitimate interest in maintaining the contract if damages are an
adequate remedy and his insistence on maintaining the contract can be described as
“wholly unreasonable”, “extremely unreasonable” or, perhaps, in my words, “perverse”’.
While these summaries represent valiant attempts to provide the courts with signposts
that they can use in future cases, it has been argued that the legitimate interest test, as
formulated by the House of Lords in 
White & Carter
, is ‘unintelligible and elusive, and
consequently incapable of responding satisfactorily to subsequent cases’ (Q Liu, ‘The
White & Carter
 
Principle: A Restatement’ (2011) 74 
MLR
 
171). In an attempt to bring
some order to the case-law, Professor Liu maintains (at pp. 192–193) that it is possible
to reformulate the ‘wholly unreasonable’ test as follows:
(1) The principal test for a legitimate interest is whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, the
wastefulness of the victim’s continuing performance outweighs its performance interest in earning the contract
price. By its nature this test is equitable and confers on the court a discretionary power, which is exercised only
in exceptional cases, to hold that the victim has no legitimate interest in continuing to perform and is thus not
entitled to the contract price. There must be some ‘very cogent reason’ for doing so, as the victim would
otherwise suffer ‘inconvenience and injustice.’ (2) In applying the ‘wholly unreasonable’ test, the courts seem to
be looking for a further good reason, in addition to the fact that the victim has a performance interest in earning
the contract price, for its continuing performance. The new test recognises more directly and clearly the
significance of such a reason. This is not to say that a further good reason is required and without it the victim
cannot have a legitimate interest in continuing to perform. Rather, the existence of such a reason may very
easily tip the scale in favour of an award of the contract price. A further good reason can be a non-pecuniary
interest in the performance of the contract … or a legal liability to a third party consequent on non-performance
… It can also be the lack of a real alternative for the victim other than continuing to perform … (3) Since the
main countervailing factor for the victim’s performance interest in earning the contract price is the wastefulness
of its continuing performance, regard must be had not only to the victim’s interests, but also to the contract-
breaker’s interests. It is not sufficient for the contract-breaker to show the mere fact of wastefulness, namely,
that the benefits of the victim’s continuing performance are small in comparison with its costs. The benefit–cost
gap must be ‘completely out of proportion’. The excessiveness of the wastefulness is necessary for the victim’s
claim for the contract price to be resisted.

Damages
Central Issues
The aim of an award of damages is generally to put the claimant in the
position which he would have been in had the contract been
performed according to its terms. The aim is thus to protect the
claimant’s ‘expectation interest’, or his ‘performance interest’. The
scope of the claimant’s expectation or performance interest is a major
focus of this chapter. Is the claimant’s expectation defined by
reference to the financial value of performance or by reference to the
performance itself? How are damages to be assessed in the case in
which the claimant does not appear to have a direct financial interest
in the performance of the contract? When is the claimant entitled to
recover the cost of making performance conform to the terms of the
contract and when is he entitled to recover the difference in value
between the performance which he has received and the performance
which he was promised? These questions will all be explored in this
chapter.
The courts have also experienced difficulty in deciding when a
claimant is entitled to recover damages for non-pecuniary losses
suffered as a result of a breach of contract. Can damages be
recovered for the disappointment of not receiving the contractual
performance which the defendant promised to provide? What is the
appropriate measure of damages in the case where, for example, the
contract is one for the provision of pleasure such as a holiday and the
defendant breaches the contract?
The law must place some limits on the liability of the defendant,
otherwise liability could prove to be endless. Doctrines, such as
remoteness of damage, are used by the courts to keep liability within
acceptable bounds. These doctrines will be examined in this chapter.
4.
5.
Consideration will also be given to the responsibility of the claimant
not to take unreasonable steps to increase the loss and to take
reasonable steps to reduce the loss caused by the breach.
English law has recently recognized a category of damages known as
‘negotiating damages’, the purpose of which is to award the claimant
damages assessed by reference to the sum that the claimant would
hypothetically have received in return for releasing the defendant from
the obligation which 
it has failed to perform. The circumstances in
which a claimant can recover negotiating damages will be considered
in this chapter and note will also be taken of the reluctance of the
courts to permit a claimant to recover damages assessed by reference
to the gain or profit which the defendant has made from its breach of
contract.
Finally, consideration will be given to the extent to which it is open to
the parties to make their own provision for the financial consequences
of a breach of contract. The courts have long exercised a jurisdiction
to control agreed damages clauses, although the extent of the
jurisdiction, and the justifications for its existence, are a source of
some controversy.
23.1
 
Introduction
The aim of this chapter is to examine the entitlement of a claimant to recover damages
in respect of a breach of contract committed by the defendant. Every breach of contract
gives rise to a claim for damages. In the case where the claimant has not suffered any
loss as a result of the breach, he is still entitled to recover damages but damages will be
nominal. The word ‘damages’, as used in this chapter, is not tied to compensatory
damages. As Professor (now Justice) Edelman suggests in his book 
Gain-Based
Damages: Contract, Tort, Equity and Intellectual Property
 
(Hart, 2002), p. 22, the
word ‘“damages” can only mean money awards which respond to wrongs’. On this view
the word ‘damages’ is not tied to any particular measure of recovery. There is a range of
measures available to the court, all of which can be described as different types of
damages. Thus we have nominal damages, compensatory damages, negotiating
damages, restitutionary (or disgorgement) damages, and exemplary (or punitive)
damages. This chapter will focus on compensatory damages but it will also explore the
circumstances in which a claimant can recover ‘negotiating damages’ and ‘an account of
profits’. Exemplary damages make only a fleeting appearance. English law does not, as
yet, recognize an entitlement to recover exemplary damages for a breach of contract.
The chapter is divided into the following sections. The bulk of it is devoted to
compensatory damages, given that they are the most commonly awarded form of
damages. It opens (at 
23.2
) with a discussion of the different measures of damages that
can be awarded and concludes that the aim of an award of damages is generally to
protect the claimant’s performance (or expectation) interest. The next section (
23.3
) is
devoted to an analysis of the performance interest and it consists largely of an analysis
of two decisions of the House of Lords. Section 
23.4
 
examines the circumstances in
which a claimant can seek damages based on his ‘reliance’ losses rather than his
performance interest, while the circumstances in which damages may be awarded to
protect the claimant’s ‘restitution’ interest is discussed at 
23.5
. Section 
23.6
 
examines
the entitlement of a claimant to recover damages in respect of non-pecuniary losses,
particularly ‘mental distress’. Section 
23.7
 
considers the general rule that damages are
assessed as at the date of breach and the exceptions to that rule. Section 
23.8
 
then turns
to a consideration of the various doctrines that the courts use in order to keep liability
within acceptable bounds. Doctrines examined in this section include remoteness,
mitigation, and contributory negligence. Section 
23.9
 
considers the availability of what
have come to be known as ‘negotiating damages’ and it will also examine the reluctance
of the modern courts to award to the innocent party an account of the profits which the
defendant has made from its breach of contract. Section 
23.10
 
examines, albeit briefly,
the possibility that exemplary damages might have a role to play in breach of contract
cases. The chapter concludes, at 
23.11
 
and 
23.12
, with a discussion of agreed damages
clauses (and related clauses) and their legal regulation.
23.2
 
Damages: The Different Measures
The most cited article ever written on the law of contract is probably Fuller and Perdue’s
article entitled ‘The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages’ which was published in two
parts in the 
Yale Law Journal
 
in 1936 and 1937. This article has been hailed as a classic
and its influence on a number of contract scholars has been immense (see, for example,
the preface to PS Atiyah, 
The Rise and Fall of Freedom of Contract
 
(Oxford University
Press, 1979)). Its major impact has been on the terminology which we use when
describing the different measures of damages that can be recovered on a breach of
contract. In this, the opening section of their essay, they set out the three different
interests that the law of contract might protect. The principal points to note are the
ranking of these three interests, their relegation of the significance of the expectation
interest (or performance interest) which, at the time, was the generally accepted
measure of recovery, and their championing of the cause of the reliance interest.
LL FULLER AND WILLIAM R PERDUE JR, ‘
THE
RELIANCE INTEREST IN CONTRACT DAMAGES
’(1936) 46 
Yale LJ
 
52, 53–62
It is convenient to distinguish three principal purposes which may be pursued in
awarding contract damages. These purposes, and the situations in which they
become appropriate, may be stated briefly as follows:
First, the plaintiff has in reliance on the promise of the defendant conferred
some value on the defendant. The defendant fails to perform his promise. The
court may force the defendant to disgorge the value he received from the plaintiff.
The object here may be termed the prevention of gain by the defaulting promisor at
the expense of the promisee; more briefly, the prevention of unjust enrichment.
The interest protected may be called the restitution interest …
Secondly, the plaintiff has in reliance on the promise of the defendant changed
his position. For example, the buyer under a contract for the sale of land has
incurred expense in the investigation of the seller’s title, or has neglected the
opportunity to enter other contracts. We may award damages to the plaintiff for the
purpose of undoing the harm which his reliance on the defendant’s promise has
caused him. Our object is to put him in as good a position as he was in before the
promise was made. The interest protected in this case may be called the reliance
interest.
Thirdly, without insisting on reliance by the promisee or enrichment of the
promisor, we may seek to give the promisee the value of the expectancy which the
promise created. We may in a suit for specific performance actually compel the
defendant to render the promised performance to the plaintiff, or, in a suit for
damages, we may make the defendant pay the money value of this performance.
Here our object is to put the plaintiff in as good a position as he would have
occupied had the defendant performed his promise. The interest protected in this
case we may call the expectation interest.
It will be observed that what we have called the restitution interest unites two
elements: (1) reliance by the promisee, (2) a resultant gain to the promisor. It may
for some purposes be necessary to separate these elements. In some cases a
defaulting promisor may after his breach be left with an unjust gain which was not
taken from the promisee (a third party furnished the consideration), or which was
not the result of reliance by the promisee (the promisor violated a promise not to
appropriate the promisee’s goods). Even in those cases where the promisor’s gain
results from the promisee’s reliance it may happen that damages will be assessed
somewhat differently, depending on whether we take the promisor’s gain or the
promisee’s loss as the standard of measurement. Generally, however … gain by
the promisor will be accompanied by a corresponding and, so far as its legal
measurement is concerned, identical loss to the promisee, so that for our purposes
the most workable classification is one which presupposes in the restitution
interest a correlation of promisor’s gain and promisee’s loss. If, as we shall
assume, the gain involved in the restitution interest results from and is identical
with the plaintiff’s loss through reliance, then the restitution interest is merely a
special case of the reliance interest; all of the cases coming under the restitution
interest will be covered by the reliance interest, and the reliance interest will be
broader than the restitution interest only to the extent that it includes cases where
the plaintiff has relied on the defendant’s promise without enriching the defendant.
It should not be supposed that the distinction here taken between the reliance
and expectation interests coincides with that sometimes taken between ‘losses
caused’ … and ‘gains prevented’. In the first place, though reliance ordinarily
results in ‘losses’ of an affirmative nature (expenditures of labor and money) it is
also true that opportunities for gain may be foregone in reliance on a promise.
Hence the reliance interest must be interpreted as at least potentially covering
‘gains prevented’ as well as ‘losses caused’. … On the other hand, it is not
possible to make the expectation interest entirely synonymous with ‘gains
prevented’. The disappointment of an expectancy often entails losses of a positive
character.
It is obvious that the three ‘interests’ we have distinguished do not present
equal claims to judicial intervention. It may be assumed that ordinary standards of
justice would regard the need for judicial intervention as decreasing in the order in
which we have listed the three interests. The ‘restitution interest’, involving a
combination of unjust impoverishment with unjust gain, presents the strongest
case for relief. If, following Aristotle, we regard the purpose of justice as the
maintenance of an equilibrium of goods among members of society, the restitution
interest presents twice as strong a claim to judicial intervention as the reliance
interest, since if A not only causes B to lose one unit but appropriates that unit to
himself, the resulting discrepancy between A and B is not one unit but two.
On the other hand, the promisee who has actually relied on the promise, even
though he may not thereby have enriched the promisor, certainly presents a more
pressing case for relief than the promisee who merely demands satisfaction for his
disappointment in not getting what was promised him. In passing from
compensation for change of position to compensation for loss of expectancy we
pass, to use Aristotle’s terms again, from the realm of corrective justice to that of
distributive justice. The law no longer seeks merely to heal a disturbed status quo,
but to bring into being a new situation. It ceases to act defensively or restoratively,
and assumes a more active role. With the transition, the justification for legal relief
loses its self-evident quality. It is as a matter of fact no easy thing to explain why
the normal rule of contract recovery should be that which measures damages by
the value of the promised performance. Since this ‘normal rule’ throws its shadow
across our whole subject it will be necessary to examine the possible reasons for
its existence. It may be said parenthetically that the discussion which follows,
though directed primarily to the normal measure of recovery where damages are
sought, also has relevance to the more general question, 
why should a promise
which has not been relied on ever be enforced at all, whether by a decree of
specific performance or by an award of damages? …
Why Should the Law Ever Protect the Expectation
Interest?
Perhaps the most obvious answer to this question is one which we may label
‘psychological’. The answer would run something as follows: The breach of a
promise arouses in the promisee a sense of injury. This feeling is not confined to
cases where the promisee has relied on the promise. Whether or not he has
actually changed his position because of the promise, the promisee has formed an
attitude of expectancy such that a breach of the promise causes him to feel that he
has been ‘deprived’ of something which was ‘his’. Since this sentiment is a
relatively uniform one, the law has no occasion to go back to it. It accepts it as a
datum and builds its rule about it.
The difficulty with this explanation is that the law does in fact go back on the
sense of injury which the breach of promise engenders. No legal system attempts
to invest with juristic sanction all promises. Some rule or combination of rules
effects a sifting out for enforcement of those promises deemed important enough
to society to justify the law’s concern with them. Whatever the principles which
control this sifting out process may be, they are not convertible into terms of the
degree of resentment which the breach of a particular kind of promise arouses.
Therefore, though it may be assumed that the impulse to assuage disappointment
is one shared by those who make and influence the law, this impulse can hardly be
regarded as the key which solves the whole problem of the protection accorded by
the law to the expectation interest.
A second possible explanation for the rule protecting the expectancy may be
found in the much-discussed ‘will theory’ of contract law. This theory views the
contracting parties as exercising, so to speak, a legislative power, so that the legal
enforcement of a contract becomes merely an implementing by the state of a kind
of private law already established by the parties. … It is enough to note here that
while the will theory undoubtedly has some bearing on the problem of contract
damages, it cannot be regarded as dictating in all cases a recovery of the
expectancy. If a contract represents a kind of private law, it is a law which usually
says nothing at all about what shall be done when it is violated. A contract is in this
respect like an imperfect statute which provides no penalties, and which leaves it
to the courts to find a way to effectuate its purposes. There would, therefore, be no
necessary contradiction between the will theory and a rule which limited damages
to the reliance interest. Under such a rule the penalty for violating the norm
established by the contract would simply consist in being compelled to
compensate the other party for detrimental reliance. Of course there may be cases
where the parties have so obviously anticipated that a certain form of judicial relief
will be given that we can, without stretching things, say that by implication they
have ‘willed’ that this relief should be given. This attitude finds a natural application
to promises to pay a definite sum of money. But certainly as to most types of
contracts it is vain to expect from the will theory a ready-made solution for the
problem of damages.
A third and more promising solution to our difficulty lies in an economic or
institutional approach. The essence of a credit economy lies in the fact that it tends
to eliminate the distinction between present and future (promised) goods.
Expectations of future values become, for purposes of trade, present values. In a
society in which credit has become a significant and pervasive institution, it is
inevitable that the expectancy created by an enforceable promise should be
regarded as a kind of property, and breach of the promise as an injury to that
property …
The most obvious objection which can be made to the economic or institutional
explanation is that it involves a 
petitio principii
. A promise has present value, why?
Because the law enforces it. ‘The expectancy’ regarded as a present value, is not
the cause of legal intervention but the consequence of it. This objection may be
reinforced by a reference to legal history. Promises were enforced long before
there was anything corresponding to a general system of ‘credit’, and recovery was
from the beginning measured by the value of the promised performance, the
‘agreed price’. It may therefore be argued that the ‘credit system’ when it finally
emerged was itself in large part built on the foundations of a juristic development
which preceded it.
The view just suggested asserts the primacy of law over economics; it sees law
not as the creature but as the creator of social institutions. The shift of emphasis
thus implied suggests the possibility of a fourth explanation for the law’s protection
of the unrelied-on expectancy, which we may call juristic. This explanation would
seek a justification for the normal rule of recovery in some policy consciously
pursued by courts and other lawmakers. It would assume that courts have
protected the expectation interest because they have considered it wise to do so,
not through a blind acquiescence in habitual ways of thinking and feeling, or
through an equally blind deference to the individual will. Approaching the problem
from this point of view, we are forced to find not a mere explanation for the rule in
the form of some sentimental, volitional, or institutional datum, but articulate
reasons for its existence.
What reasons can be advanced? In the first place, even if our interest were
confined to protecting promisees against out-of-pocket loss, it would still be
possible to justify the rule granting the value of the expectancy, both as a cure for,
and as a prophylaxis against, losses of this sort.
It is a cure for these losses in the sense that it offers the measure of recovery
most likely to reimburse the plaintiff for the (often very numerous and very difficult
to prove) individual acts and forbearances which make up his total reliance on the
contract. If we take into account ‘gains prevented’ by reliance, that is, losses
involved in foregoing the opportunity to enter other contracts, the notion that the
rule protecting the expectancy is adopted as the most effective means of
compensating for detrimental reliance seems not at all far-fetched. Physicians with
an extensive practice often charge their patients the full office call fee for broken
appointments. Such a charge looks on the face of things like a claim to the
promised fee; it seems to be based on the ‘expectation interest’. Yet the physician
making the charge will quite justifiably regard it as compensation for the loss of the
opportunity to gain a similar fee from a different patient. This foregoing of other
opportunities is involved to some extent in entering most contracts, and the
impossibility of subjecting this type of reliance to any kind of measurement may
justify a categorical rule granting the value of the expectancy as the most effective
way of compensating for such losses.
The rule that the plaintiff must after the defendant’s breach take steps to
mitigate damages tends to corroborate the suspicion that there lies hidden behind
the protection of the expectancy a concern to compensate the plaintiff for the loss
of the opportunity to enter other contracts. Where after the defendant’s breach the
opportunity remains open to the plaintiff to sell his services or goods elsewhere, or
to fill his needs from another source, he is bound to embrace that opportunity.
Viewed in this way the rule of ‘avoidable harms’ is a qualification on the protection
accorded the expectancy, since it means that the plaintiff, in those cases where it
is applied, is protected only to the extent that he has in reliance on the contract
foregone other equally advantageous opportunities for accomplishing the same
end.
But, as we have suggested, the rule measuring damages by the expectancy
may also be regarded as a prophylaxis against the losses resulting from
detrimental reliance. Whatever tends to discourage breach of contract tends to
prevent the losses occasioned through reliance. Since the expectation interest
furnishes a more easily administered measure of recovery than the reliance
interest, it will in practice offer a more effective sanction against contract breach. It
is therefore possible to view the rule measuring damages by the expectancy in a
quasi-criminal aspect, its purpose being not so much to compensate the promisee
as to penalize breach of promise by the promisor. The rule enforcing the unrelied-
on-promise finds the same justification, on this theory, as an ordinance which fines
a man for driving through a stop-light when no other vehicle is in sight.
In seeking justification for the rule granting the value of the expectancy there is
no need, however, to restrict ourselves by the assumption hitherto made, that the
rule can only be intended to cure or prevent the losses caused by reliance. A
justification can be developed from a less negative point of view. It may be said
that there is not only a policy in favor of preventing and undoing the harms
resulting from reliance, but also a policy in favor of promoting and facilitating
reliance on business agreements. As in the case of the stop-light ordinance we are
interested not only in preventing collisions but in speeding traffic. Agreements can
accomplish little, either for their makers or for society, unless they are made the
basis for action. When business agreements are not only made but are also acted
on, the division of labor is facilitated, goods find their way to the places where they
are most needed, and economic activity is generally stimulated. These advantages
would be threatened by any rule which limited legal protection to the reliance
interest. Such a rule would in practice tend to discourage reliance. The difficulties
in proving reliance and subjecting it to pecuniary measurement are such that the
business man knowing, or sensing, that these obstacles stood in the way of judicial
relief would hesitate to rely on a promise in any case where the legal sanction was
of significance to him. To encourage reliance we must therefore dispense with its
proof. For this reason it has been found wise to make recovery on a promise
independent of reliance, both in the sense that in some cases the promise is
enforced though not relied on (as in the bilateral business agreement) and in the
sense that recovery is not limited to the detriment incurred in reliance.
The juristic explanation in its final form is then twofold. It rests the protection
accorded to the expectancy on (1) the need for curing and preventing the harms
occasioned by reliance, and (2) on the need for facilitating reliance on business
agreements. From this spelling out of a possible juristic explanation, it is clear that
there is no incompatibility between it and the economic or institutional explanation.
The essence of both of them lies in the word ‘credit’. The economic justification
views credit from its institutional side; the juristic explanation views it from its
rational side. The economic view sees credit as an accepted way of living; the
juristic view invites us to explore the considerations of utility which underlie this
mode of living; and the part which conscious human direction has played in
bringing it into being.
At the end of the day Fuller and Perdue do not seriously challenge the courts’ practice of
awarding expectation damages. Rather, they challenge the theoretical justifications for
making such awards. The justification, in their view, lies not in the need to protect the
‘interest’ created by a binding promise but in the desire to provide a cure for, and
prophylaxis against, reliance losses. Other jurists, building on the work of Fuller and
Perdue, went further and openly questioned the justifications for awarding damages to
protect the claimant’s expectation interest, particularly in the case where the contract
remained executory. The courts have, however, remained stubbornly resistant to Fuller
and Perdue’s analysis and have not demonstrated a willingness to abandon their
commitment to the protection of the expectation or the performance interest (see S
Macauley, ‘The Reliance Interest and the World Outside the Law Schools’ Doors’ [1991]
Wisc LR
 
247, esp. pp. 266–287).
Fuller and Perdue’s analysis has been challenged, in what is suggested is a convincing
fashion, by Professor Friedmann in the following terms:
D FRIEDMANN, ‘
THE PERFORMANCE INTEREST IN
(1)
(2)
(1)
(2)
(3)
CONTRACT DAMAGES
’
(1995) 111 
LQR
 
628, 629–639, 646–650, and 654
The essence of contract is performance. Contracts are made in order to be
performed. This is usually the one and only ground for their formation. Ordinarily, a
person enters into a contract because he is interested in getting that which the
other party has to offer and because he places a higher value on the other party’s
performance than on the cost and trouble he will incur to obtain it. This interest in
getting the promised performance (hereafter the ‘performance interest’) is the only
pure contractual interest. The performance interest is protected by specific
remedies which aim at getting the innocent party the very performance promised to
him, and by substitutional remedies. The specific remedies are:
Specific performance and injunction, originally equitable and, therefore,
discretionary remedies.
The recovery of a debt …
The substitutional remedies are:
Compensating damages or ‘loss of bargain’ damages. It is also possible to
term them ‘performance damages’, since they are intended to put the
plaintiff in as good a position as that in which he would have been, had the
contract been performed.
Recovery of the ‘substitute’ which relates to the situation in which the
promisor can no longer perform but has obtained a substitute for the
promised performance. Examples of such a ‘substitute’ include insurance
proceeds for a loss, and damages or price paid by a third party …
Recovery in restitution of profits made by the other party through the
breach. This remedy partly overlaps the right to the substitute … but the
extent of its availability has been much debated …
The performance interest is also protected against third parties by means of the
tort of inducement of breach of contract and also by equitable and restitutionary
remedies.
The Ranking of Interests and the New Terminology
Fuller and Perdue … identified three interests: the expectation interest, the
reliance interest and the restitution interest. These interests were ranked in
accordance with the strength of their claim for judicial intervention. Restitution
arrived first and reliance second. The expectation interest ended at the bottom of
the list.
The expectation interest is simply an inappropriate term describing the
performance interest. The other two have acquired the title ‘interest’ probably
under the influence of German law. Whatever is the nature of reliance and
restitution, they are certainly not contractual interests. Thus, the interest of a
person who made a payment in order to get a house, a car or even a pizza is to
get the house, the car or the pizza. Such a person will be greatly surprised to learn
that upon contracting to purchase a house, he acquired an interest in getting his
payment back (restitution interest). In all probability he is likely to protest that this is
not 
what he wanted. Had he preferred the money to the house he would not have
made the contract in the first place. He would need a lot of coaching in an
American course on contracts to learn that his interest in getting his payment back
ranks higher in the hierarchy than his interest in getting the house …
The greatest terminological innovation of Fuller and Perdue and the most
inappropriate one, was the invention of the ‘expectation’ or ‘expectancy’. This term
… was used to describe the normal measure of contractual damages, namely the
measure based upon the right to get the promised performance … one can hardly
conceive of a term that is less appropriate than ‘expectancy’ or ‘expectation’.
‘Expectancy’ is often used to describe a prospect or a probability of receiving a
benefit in the future, when this possibility is not supported by a legal right …
Indeed, the term ‘expectation’ may be more appropriate in this context, in which
the expectation is not based upon a legal right, than in the contractual context, in
which the plaintiff has a legal right to receive that which was promised to him.
The Marginalisation of the Performance Interest
The next step in Fuller and Perdue’s derogation of the right to performance comes
in the process of the ranking of interests, in which the performance interest (now
already diminished to a mere ‘expectancy’) is outclassed by both restitution and
reliance. That being accomplished, there comes a question which casts doubt
upon the very legitimacy of the right to performance. The subtitle on page 57 of the
article reads: ‘Why Should the Law Ever Protect the Expectation Interest?’ This is
followed by a rather detailed discussion in which expectation again does not fare
too well. In essence, three explanations are offered …
The third and only justification which Fuller and Perdue find for what they term
‘expectation’ damages lies in the ‘difficulties in proving reliance and subjecting it to
pecuniary measurement … To encourage reliance we must therefore dispense with
its proof’. Performance damages, thus, receive an additional blow. They are not
justified in their own right. They are merely parasitic and exist because of the
difficulties in measuring the ‘real’ interest, namely reliance.
The argument is most unconvincing. The proof of reliance losses is by no
means more difficult than proof of performance (or ‘expectation’) losses, even if
they are to include ‘loss of opportunity’. … In fact, reliance damages are
sometimes awarded on the ground that it is impossible to appraise the
performance, or ‘loss of bargain’, damages. This, of course, is the very opposite of
the argument made by Fuller and Perdue.
The difficulties with Fuller and Perdue’s reasoning are, however, more
fundamental … they accept the ‘will theory’ and the premise that a contractual
promise is legally binding. They assume, however, that the question of the remedy
is completely divorced from the nature of the right. It is, therefore, open to prefer
the reliance measure of damages to that of the performance (in their terminology
‘expectation’). The reasoning is, however, most unconvincing. It is, of course,
legitimate to examine the grounds for recognizing the binding effect of contracts. …
However, Fuller and Perdue avoided this question. They accepted the validity of
the contractual obligation but erroneously assumed that it entails few
consequences as to the remedy.
It is, of course, true that the mere recognition of a specific right does not
provide answers to all issues regarding the remedies available for its protection.
Thus, the fact that the legal system recognizes the right of ownership does not tell
us whether the owner, whose property was misappropriated, will be entitled to
restitution in specie or merely to damages. The rules on remoteness of damages
are similarly not self-evident. It is, however, an unwarranted 
jump to conclude that
the right tells us nothing about the remedy and that rights and remedies raise
totally unrelated issues.
It is submitted that the very recognition of a legal right entails some
consequences regarding the remedy, one of which relates to the initial point of
inquiry. This initial point relates to the value of legal right, at least where such value
can be ascertained. The right of recovery may be qualified or subject to
exceptions. The initial point is, however, clear.
Thus, suppose that P acquired for $300 shares which are now worth $1000.
The shares have been misappropriated by D. In Fuller and Perdue’s terminology
the $300 represents ‘reliance loss’ whereas the $1000 represents ‘expectation
damages’. After all, P never had the $1000. He had shares which he could expect
to sell. This expectation, if realised, would yield him $1000. However, the
translation of the situation into Fuller and Perdue’s terminology merely confuses
the issue. The historical expenditure or the reliance interest (in the above example,
$300) is irrelevant, except where it serves as evidence of existing value. Recovery
is based upon the present value of the shares. The recognition of P’s right of
property suffices to justify such recovery.
It is clearly legitimate to question the justification of private property. However,
once private ownership is recognized, it follows as a matter of course that the
owner whose property has been misappropriated will either recover it in specie or
will get damages reflecting its value. In order to justify this result, there is no need
to resort to the ‘lost opportunity’ explanation (the owner could have bought other
shares that might have similarly appreciated in value) or to some other fiction.
Let us now revert to the contract situation. Suppose that in consideration of
$300 D undertook to transfer to P, within 6 months, certain shares. After 5 months,
when the price of the shares reaches $1000, D reneges. If we assume that the
contract was valid so that it vested in P the right to the promised performance, it
follows that P would be entitled either to specific performance (the value of which is
$1000) or to the substitutionary remedy of damages, which will be based upon the
value of the promised performance, namely $1000.
This argument, as well as the analogy to property, is strengthened by the
possibility of assignment. In the property example P could sell the shares for
$1000. In the contract example he could have assigned his contractual right to
receive the shares for a similar amount. In both instances, the measure of recovery
ought, therefore, to be similar. To claim that the contract was binding, i.e. that P
was entitled to D’s performance, and yet that recovery can be confined to P’s
expenditure ($300), is a contradiction in terms.
Fuller and Perdue feel, however, that the obvious result needs explanation. The
superfluous explanation is based upon the lost opportunity theory, which forms part
of the reliance loss. Because P entered into contract no. 1 with D, he gave up the
possibility of another potential contract (contract no. 2) with a third party (T) which
would have yielded him similar gains. The argument is doubly flawed. First, if P’s
gains from the actual contract (no. 1) with D are not recoverable in their own right
as part of his performance (or ‘expectation’) interest, why do these very gains
become recoverable when attributed to another potential contract (contract no. 2)?
Is it because they have changed denomination and appear under the guise of
reliance? Second, the whole argument is based on circular reasoning. If it is
assumed that the entitlement to recover performance (expectation) damages in
contract no. 1 derives solely from the lost opportunity (potential contract no. 2), we
have to examine the value of this opportunity. This is obviously dependent upon
the nature of the entitlement and the ensuing measure of damages in potential
contract no. 2. If there is no justification for performance damages (other than lost
opportunity) then the value of contract no. 2 was not $1000, but a mere $300,
unless we assume that the recovery will again be based on lost opportunity
(potential contract no. 3) and so ad infinitum.
The Value of the Legal Right and the Measure of
Damages in Contract and Tort
Fuller and Perdue raise the question whether broad adoption in contracts of the so
called ‘tort principle’, namely, the reliance interest, would not ‘blur the lines of
division separating the different branches of the law’. In their view the breaking of
the barriers between the branches of the law of obligations ‘would represent a
distinct service to legal thinking’.
The basic assumption that there exists, on this specific point, such a barrier
between tort and contract damages is, however, erroneous. It is assumed that tort
damages look backwards and aim at returning the plaintiff to the status quo ante
whereas contract damages look forward and strive to put the plaintiff in the position
in which he would have been in had the contract been performed. Reliance
damages are, thus, akin to the tort principle since they are meant to put the plaintiff
in his pre-contract position, whereas performance damages reflect the contract
principle.
This analysis is based on a misconception which derives from the failure to
adequately distinguish between rights and remedies. It is submitted that the basic
principle as to damages is identical in contract and tort, though there may be some
variations in its application. The principle provides in essence that the purpose of
damages is to put the plaintiff, in economic terms, in the position in which he would
have been had the wrong (either a tort or breach of contract) not been committed.
The different results reached in tort and contract derive from the fact that they are
usually called on to protect different rights. Where, however, they are invoked to
protect the same right, the calculation of damages, which reflect the value of this
right, either in tort or in contract, will be similar …
The Impact of Fuller and Perdue—Terminology and
Substance
(a)
 
Terminological impact
As already pointed out, the most significant effect of Fuller and Perdue lies in the
introduction of new terminology. No student is likely to complete an American
course on contracts without reciting ‘expectation interest’ and ‘reliance interest’. In
recent years the new terminology has spread to England and to other
Commonwealth jurisdictions …
(b)
 
Substantive impact
… Fuller and Perdue did not expressly advocate the curtailment of the protection
granted to the performance interest. However, much of the article consists of an
attempt to question its justification, to describe it as an ‘expectancy’ and to suggest
its legitimacy depends on reliance. They also hinted at the possibility of limiting
recovery to reliance losses in certain cases in which a binding contract has been
concluded, notably in situations that are not within the credit system. Professor
Atiyah went a step further. He was ‘troubled and uncertain about the extent to
which executory contracts should be enforced, and the extent to which the
expectation damages measure is appropriate … ’ He also considered that ‘it would
not be surprising if future developments tend to show a still further whittling down
of expectation damages’.
Modern law hardly reflects any traces of this approach … Notwithstanding The
Reliance Interest there are no signs of weakening of the performance interest. On
the contrary, one of the major trends in modern contract law is the strengthening of
the protection accorded to the performance interest. Traditional limitations upon
the availability of specific performance and upon the recovery of performance
damages have either been removed or severely curtailed …
The scope of specific performance has spread beyond real estate cases to
many other types of contracts. … The law of damages shows similar signs of
expanding the protection granted to the performance interest. The fundamental
principle under which, so far as money can do it, the injured party should be placed
in the same situation as if the contract had been performed, is constantly applied.
Furthermore, legal rules that have in the past limited the prospect of obtaining full
performance damages seem to lose at least part of their effect. … Another
development which reflects the strengthening of the performance interest relates to
the measure of recovery where the defendant renders a defective performance or
a performance which is not in line with contract requirements. The cost of curing
the defect is usually higher than the difference in market value between the
performance as rendered and the value of the performance had it conformed to the
terms of the contract. In this type of situation recovery was often confined to the
difference in value, if the cost of cure was disproportionate to the difference in
value. However, the present tendency is to award the plaintiff the cost of repair
even where there is a large disparity between this cost and the difference in value,
provided that it is reasonable for the plaintiff to insist on reinstatement.
Furthermore, circumstances are conceivable in which the costs of repair are
unreasonable while the difference in value is small or even nil. Under the traditional
approach, in such a case, the plaintiff might have been left without a remedy. The
recent decision of the House of Lords in 
Ruxley Electronics Ltd
 
[
23.3.1
] indicates
that these two measures of recovery are not exhaustive, and that damages might
be awarded by reference to the fact that the plaintiff’s performance interest has
been frustrated by the defendant’s breach. The court may, thus, be required to
appraise an element that has no market price in order to provide an adequate
remedy. Needless to say, this development is predicated on the approach that
pacta sunt servanda
 
and that the plaintiff’s performance interest should be
respected.
The expansion of the protection afforded to the performance interest is also
reflected in the rules relating to non-economic losses. Traditionally, recovery of
damages for such losses, resulting from breach of contract, has not been allowed.
But this rule is becoming the subject of ever-increasing exceptions …
There is a great discrepancy between The Reliance Interest’s intellectual
appeal and its effect on substantive law. The article made a deep impact on
academic thinking, upon the language and discourse of contracts and led to the
adoption of new terminology, which in the case of ‘expectation’ was an unhappy
development. Its effect on substantive law is at best secondary. The attack upon
the performance interest goes against the grain. This interest constitutes the very
core of contract law. Its ample protection is likely to be maintained and possibly
expanded as long as the essence of contract law as we know it remains.
23.3
 
The Performance Interest
As Professor Friedmann notes, the courts remain committed to the protection of the
claimant’s performance interest (to use Professor Friedmann’s phrase in preference to
the language of the ‘expectation’ interest employed by Fuller and Perdue). In his article
Professor Friedmann argues that ‘one of the major trends in modern contract law is the
strengthening of the protection afforded to the performance interest’. It is certainly true
that the courts’ commitment to the protection of the performance interest has been
tested in the courts but it is suggested that their commitment to the performance
interest can be seen to be less than whole-hearted.
It is the case that the starting point for the courts’ analysis is a commitment to the
protection of the performance interest. This was classically expressed by Parke B in
Robinson
 
v. 
Harman
 
(1848) 1 Ex 850, 855 when he stated that:
the rule of the common law is, that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as
money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been
performed.
This commitment to the performance interest expressed by Parke B has been challenged
in the courts recently in two different ways. The first relates to the method chosen by the
court to fulfil the performance interest. There are two principal methods. The first is to
award the claimant the difference in value between the performance for which he
contracted and the performance which he received. This measure is committed to
putting the claimant in the financial position which he would have been in had the
contract been performed according to its terms (in the sense that the expected increase
in his wealth will be protected). The alternative is to award the claimant damages
assessed on a ‘cost of cure’ basis. On this basis, the claimant is given the sum of money
needed in order to enable him to obtain the performance for which he contracted. This
measure is committed to enabling the claimant to obtain performance itself rather than
the economic value of performance (as is the case in the diminution in value measure).
In many cases the difference between the two measures is relatively trivial and it does
not give rise to litigation. But in some cases the difference can be substantial. One such
case is the decision of the House of Lords in 
Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd
 
v.
Forsyth
 
[1996] AC 344, to which we shall shortly turn.
The second issue that has arisen relates to the case in which the claimant has no direct
financial interest in the performance of the contract. The classic example is a case in
which the claimant enters into a contract under which he agrees to pay for repair work
to be done on the property of a third party. What is the measure of the claimant’s
recovery in the event that the repair work is carried out defectively? Can the party who
carried out the work maintain that the claimant is only entitled to nominal damages on
the basis that he has suffered no loss as a result of the fact that work on someone else’s
property has been done defectively? This is the principal issue that arose in our second
case, which is the extremely difficult decision of the House of Lords in 
Alfred McAlpine

FORSYTH
[1996] AC 344, House of Lords
The plaintiffs entered into a contract with the defendant under which they agreed to
build a swimming pool for the defendant in his garden. It was agreed that the pool
would be built to a depth of seven feet six inches. In breach of contract the
plaintiffs built the swimming pool to a depth of six feet. When he eventually
discovered this fact the defendant refused to pay the contract price. The plaintiffs
sued him for the price. The trial judge held that the defendant was liable to pay the
price for the work done on the basis that the plaintiffs had ‘substantially performed’
their obligations under the contract. The defendant was therefore left to his
counterclaim for damages for breach of contract.
At trial, two points were established via expert evidence. The first was that the
difference in value between a pool built to a depth of seven feet six inches and one
built to a depth of six feet was nil. The second was that the only practicable way to
increase the depth was to rebuild the pool at a cost of £21,560. The trial judge also
found that the difference in depth did not in any way impair the defendant’s use of
the pool.
The trial judge refused to award the defendant damages assessed on a cost of
cure basis and instead awarded him ‘loss of amenity’ damages of £2,500. The
Court of Appeal allowed the defendant’s appeal and held that he was entitled to
cost of cure damages of £21,560. The plaintiffs appealed to the House of Lords.
The appeal was allowed. It was held that the defendant (the respondent in the
appeal) was not entitled to recover damages assessed on a cost of cure basis on
the ground that the cost of carrying out the work was out of all proportion to the
benefit which he would receive from full performance. There being no challenge by
the plaintiffs to the trial judge’s award of £2,500 damages for ‘loss of amenity’, it
was held that this fixed the measure of the defendant’s recovery.
Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle
Damages are designed to compensate for an established loss and not to provide a
gratuitous benefit to the aggrieved party from which it follows that the
reasonableness of an award of damages is to be linked directly to the loss
sustained. If it is unreasonable in a particular case to award the cost of
reinstatement it must be because the loss sustained does not extend to the need
to reinstate. A failure to achieve the precise contractual objective does not
necessarily result in the loss which is occasioned by a total failure …
I take the example suggested during argument by my noble and learned friend,
Lord Bridge of Harwich. A man contracts for the building of a house and specifies
that one of the lower courses of brick should be blue. The builder uses yellow brick
instead. In all other respects the house conforms to the contractual specification.
To replace the yellow bricks with blue would involve extensive demolition and
reconstruction at a very large cost. It would clearly be unreasonable to award to
the owner the cost of reconstructing because his loss was not the necessary cost
of reconstruction of his house, which was entirely adequate for its design purpose,
but merely the lack of aesthetic pleasure which he might have derived from the
sight of blue bricks. Thus in the present appeal the respondent has acquired a
perfectly serviceable swimming pool, albeit one lacking the specified depth. His
loss is thus not the lack of a useable pool with consequent need to construct a new
one. Indeed were he to receive the cost of building a new one and retain the
existing one he would have recovered not compensation for loss but a very
substantial gratuitous benefit, something which damages are not intended to
provide.
What constitutes the aggrieved party’s loss is in every case a question of fact
and degree. Where the contract breaker has entirely failed to achieve the
contractual objective it may not be difficult to conclude that the loss is the
necessary cost of achieving that objective. Thus if a building is constructed so
defectively that it is of no use for its designed purpose the owner may have little
difficulty in establishing that his loss is the necessary cost of reconstructing.
Furthermore in taking reasonableness into account in determining the extent of
loss it is reasonableness in relation to the particular contract and not at large.
Accordingly if I contracted for the erection of a folly in my garden which shortly
thereafter suffered a total collapse it would be irrelevant to the determination of my
loss to argue that the erection of such a folly which contributed nothing to the value
of my house was a crazy thing to do. As Oliver J said in 
Radford
 
v. 
De Froberville
[1977] 1 WLR 1262, 1270:
‘If he contracts for the supply of that which he thinks serves his interests—be they commercial, aesthetic
or merely eccentric—then if that which is contracted for is not supplied by the 
other contracting party I do
not see why, in principle, he should not be compensated by being provided with the cost of supplying it
through someone else or in a different way, subject to the proviso, of course, that he is seeking
compensation for a genuine loss and not merely using a technical breach to secure an uncovenanted
profit.’
However where the contractual objective has been achieved to a substantial extent
the position may be very different.
It was submitted that where the objective of a building contract involved
satisfaction of a personal preference the only measure of damages available for a
breach involving failure to achieve such satisfaction was the cost of reinstatement.
In my view this is not the case. Personal preference may well be a factor in
reasonableness and hence in determining what loss has been suffered but it
cannot per se be determinative of what that loss is.
My Lords, the trial judge found that it would be unreasonable to incur the cost
of demolishing the existing pool and building a new and deeper one. In so doing he
implicitly recognized that the respondent’s loss did not extend to the cost of
reinstatement. He was, in my view, entirely justified in reaching that conclusion. It
therefore follows that the appeal must be allowed.
It only remains to mention two further matters. The appellant argued that the
cost of reinstatement should only be allowed as damages where there was shown
to be an intention on the part of the aggrieved party to carry out the work. Having
already decided that the appeal should be allowed I no longer find it necessary to
reach a conclusion on this matter. However I should emphasise that in the normal
case the court has no concern with the use to which a plaintiff puts an award of
damages for a loss which has been established. Thus irreparable damage to an
article as a result of a breach of contract will entitle the owner to recover the value
of the article irrespective of whether he intends to replace it with a similar one or to
spend the money on something else. Intention, or lack of it, to reinstate can have
relevance only to reasonableness and hence to the extent of the loss which has
been sustained. Once that loss has been established intention as to the
subsequent use of the damages ceases to be relevant.
The second matter relates to the award of £2,500 for loss of amenity made by
the trial judge. The respondent argued that he erred in law in making such award.
However as the appellant did not challenge it, I find it unnecessary to express any
opinion on the matter.
Lord Mustill
My Lords, I agree that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons stated by my
noble and learned friends, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle and Lord Lloyd of Berwick. I
add some observations of my own on the award by the trial judge of damages in a
sum intermediate between, on the one hand, the full cost of reinstatement, and on
the other the amount by which the malperformance has diminished the market
value of the property on which the work was done: in this particular case, nil. This
is a question of everyday practical importance to householders who have engaged
contractors to carry out small building works, and then find (as often happens) that
performance has fallen short of what was promised. I think it proper to enter on the
question here, although there is no appeal against the award, because the
possibility of such a recovery in a suitable case sheds light on the employer’s claim
that reinstatement is the only proper measure of damage.
The proposition that these two measures of damage represent the only
permissible bases of recovery lie at the heart of the employer’s case. From this he
reasons that there is a presumption in favour of the cost of restitution, since this is
the only way in which he can be given what the contractor had promised to
provide. Finally, he contends that there is nothing in the facts of the present case to
rebut this presumption.
The attraction of this argument is its avoidance of the conclusion that, in a case
such as the present, unless the employer can prove that the defects have
depreciated the market value of the property the householder can recover nothing
at all. This conclusion would be unacceptable to the average householder, and it is
unacceptable to me. It is a common feature of small building works performed on
residential property that the cost of the work is not fully reflected by an increase in
the market value of the house, and that comparatively minor deviations from
specification or sound workmanship may have no direct financial effect at all. Yet
the householder must surely be entitled to say that he chose to obtain from the
builder a promise to produce a particular result because he wanted to make his
house more comfortable, more convenient and more conformable to his own
particular tastes; not because he had in mind that the work might increase the
amount which he would receive if, contrary to expectation, he thought it expedient
in the future to exchange his home for cash. To say that in order to escape
unscathed the builder has only to show that to the mind of the average onlooker, or
the average potential buyer, the results which he has produced seem just as good
as those which he had promised would make a part of the promise illusory, and
unbalance the bargain. In the valuable analysis contained in 
Radford
 
v. 
De
Froberville
 
[1977] 1 WLR 1262, Oliver J emphasised, at p. 1270, that it was for the
plaintiff to judge what performance he required in exchange for the price. The court
should honour that choice. 
Pacta sunt servanda
. If the appellant’s argument leads
to the conclusion that in all cases like the present the employer is entitled to no
more than nominal damages, the average householder would say that there must
be something wrong with the law.
In my opinion there would indeed be something wrong if, on the hypothesis that
cost of reinstatement and the depreciation in value were the only available
measures of recovery, the rejection of the former necessarily entailed the adoption
of the latter; and the court might be driven to opt for the cost of reinstatement,
absurd as the consequence might often be, simply to escape from the conclusion
that the promisor can please himself whether or not to comply with the wishes of
the promisee which, as embodied in the contract, formed part of the consideration
for the price. Having taken on the job the contractor is morally as well as legally
obliged to give the employer what he stipulated to obtain, and this obligation ought
not to be devalued. In my opinion however the hypothesis is not correct. There are
not two alternative measures of damage, at opposite poles, but only one; namely,
the loss truly suffered by the promisee. In some cases the loss cannot be fairly
measured except by reference to the full cost of repairing the deficiency in
performance. In others, and in particular those where the contract is designed to
fulfil a purely commercial purpose, the loss will very often consist only of the
monetary detriment brought about by the breach of contract. But these remedies
are not exhaustive, for the law must cater for those occasions where the value of
the promise to the promisee exceeds the financial enhancement of his position
which full performance will secure. This excess, often referred to in the literature as
the ‘consumer surplus’ (see for example the valuable discussion by Harris, Ogus
and Phillips (1979) 95 
LQR
 
581) is usually incapable of precise valuation in terms
of money, exactly because it represents a personal, subjective and non-monetary
gain. Nevertheless where it exists the law should recognize it and compensate the
promisee if the misperformance takes it away. The lurid bathroom tiles, or the
grotesque folly instanced in argument by my noble and learned friend, Lord Keith
of Kinkel, may be so discordant with general taste that in purely economic terms
the builder may be said to do the employer a favour by failing to install them. But
this is too narrow and materialistic a view of the transaction. Neither the contractor
nor the court has the right to substitute for the employer’s individual expectation of
performance a criterion derived from what ordinary people would regard as
sensible. As my Lords have shown, the test of reasonableness plays a central part
in determining the basis of recovery, and will 
indeed be decisive in a case such as
the present when the cost of reinstatement would be wholly disproportionate to the
non-monetary loss suffered by the employer. But it would be equally unreasonable
to deny all recovery for such a loss. The amount may be small, and since it cannot
be quantified directly there may be room for difference of opinion about what it
should be. But in several fields the judges are well accustomed to putting figures to
intangibles, and I see no reason why the imprecision of the exercise should be a
barrier, if that is what fairness demands.
My Lords, once this is recognized the puzzling and paradoxical feature of this
case, that it seems to involve a contest of absurdities, simply falls away. There is
no need to remedy the injustice of awarding too little, by unjustly awarding far too
much. The judgment of the trial judge acknowledges that the employer has
suffered a true loss and expresses it in terms of money. Since there is no longer
any issue about the amount of the award, as distinct from the principle, I would
simply restore his judgment by allowing the appeal.
Lord Lloyd of Berwick
[after setting out the facts in considerable detail continued]
Reasonableness
The starting point is 
Robinson
 
v. 
Harman
 
[see 
23.3
].
This does not mean that in every case of breach of contract the plaintiff can
obtain the monetary equivalent of specific performance. It is first necessary to
ascertain the loss the plaintiff has in fact suffered by reason of the breach. If he
has suffered no loss, as sometimes happens, he can recover no more than
nominal damages. For the object of damages is always to compensate the plaintiff,
not to punish the defendant.
This was never more clearly stated than by Viscount Haldane LC in the first of
the two broad principles which he formulated in 
British Westinghouse Electric and
Manufacturing Co Ltd
 
v. 
Underground Electric Railways Co of London Ltd
 
[1912]
AC 673, 689:
‘The first is that, as far as possible, he who has proved a breach of a bargain to supply what he
contracted to get is to be placed, as far as money can do it, in as good a situation as if the contract had
been performed. The fundamental basis is thus compensation for pecuniary loss naturally flowing from
the breach … ’
Note that Lord Haldane does not say that the plaintiff is always to be placed in the
same situation physically as if the contract had been performed, but in as good a
situation financially, so far as money can do it. This necessarily involves measuring
the pecuniary loss which the plaintiff has in fact sustained.
In building cases, the pecuniary loss is almost always measured in one of two
ways; either the difference in value of the work done or the cost of reinstatement.
Where the cost of reinstatement is less than the difference in value, the measure of
damages will invariably be the cost of reinstatement. By claiming the difference in
value the plaintiff would be failing to take reasonable steps to mitigate his loss. In
many ordinary cases, too, where reinstatement presents no special problem, the
cost of reinstatement will be the obvious measure of damages, even where there is
little or no difference in value, or where the difference in value is hard to assess.
This is why it is often said that the cost of reinstatement is the ordinary measure of
damages for defective performance under a building contract.
But it is not the only measure of damages. Sometimes it is the other way round.
This was first made clear in the celebrated judgment of Cardozo J giving the
majority opinion 
in the Court of Appeals of New York in 
Jacob & Youngs
 
v. 
Kent
,
129 NE 889. In that case the building owner specified that the plumbing should be
carried out with galvanized piping of ‘Reading manufacture’. By an oversight, the
builder used piping of a different manufacture. The plaintiff builder sued for the
balance of his account. The defendant, as in the instant case, counter-claimed the
cost of replacing the pipe work even though it would have meant demolishing a
substantial part of the completed structure, at great expense. Cardozo J pointed
out, at p. 891, that there is ‘no general license to install whatever, in the builder’s
judgment, may be regarded as “just as good”.’ But he went on to consider the
measure of damages in the following paragraph:
‘In the circumstances of this case, we think the measure of the allowance is not the cost of replacement,
which would be great, but the difference in value, which would be either nominal or nothing. … It is true
that in most cases the cost of replacement is the measure. … The owner is entitled to the money which
will permit him to complete, unless the cost of completion is grossly and unfairly out of proportion to the
good to be attained. When that is true, the measure is the difference in value. Specifications call, let us
say, for a foundation built of granite quarried in Vermont. On the completion of the building, the owner
learns that through the blunder of a sub-contractor part of the foundation has been built of granite of the
same quality quarried in New Hampshire. The measure of allowance is not the cost of reconstruction.
There may be omissions of that which could not afterwards be supplied exactly as called for by the
contract without taking down the building to its foundations, and at the same time the omission may not
affect the value of the building for use or otherwise, except so slightly as to be hardly appreciable.’
Cardozo J’s judgment is important, because it establishes two principles, which I
believe to be correct, and which are directly relevant to the present case; first, the
cost of reinstatement is not the appropriate measure of damages if the expenditure
would be out of all proportion to the benefit to be obtained, and, secondly, the
appropriate measure of damages in such a case is the difference in value, even
though it would result in a nominal award.
If the court takes the view that it would be unreasonable for the plaintiff to insist
on reinstatement, as where, for example, the expense of the work involved would
be out of all proportion to the benefit to be obtained, then the plaintiff will be
confined to the difference in value. If the judge had assessed the difference in
value in the present case at, say, £5,000, I have little doubt that the Court of
Appeal would have taken that figure rather than £21,560. The difficulty arises
because the judge has, in the light of the expert evidence, assessed the difference
in value as nil. But that cannot make reasonable what he has found to be
unreasonable.
So I cannot accept that reasonableness is confined to the doctrine of mitigation.
It has a wider impact. … How then does [counsel for the defendant] seek to
support the majority judgment? It can only be, I think, by attacking the judge’s
finding of fact that the cost of rebuilding the pool would have been out of all
proportion to the benefit to be obtained. [Counsel for the defendant] argues that
this was not an ordinary commercial contract but a contract for a personal
preference. … I am far from saying that personal preferences are irrelevant when
choosing the appropriate measure of damages (‘predilections’ was the word used
by Ackner LJ in 
G.W. Atkins Ltd
 
v. 
Scott
, 7 Const LJ 215, 221, adopting the
language of Oliver J in 
Radford
 
v. 
De Froberville
 
[1977] 1 WLR 1262). But such
cases should not be elevated into a separate category with special rules. If, to take
an example mentioned in the course of argument, a landowner wishes to build a
folly in his grounds, it is no answer to a claim for defective workmanship that many
people might regard the presence of a well built folly as reducing the value of the
estate. The eccentric landowner is entitled to his whim, provided 
the cost of
reinstatement is not unreasonable. But the difficulty of that line of argument in the
present case is that the judge, as is clear from his judgment, took Mr Forsyth’s
personal preferences and predilections into account. Nevertheless, he found as a
fact that the cost of reinstatement was unreasonable in the circumstances. The
Court of Appeal ought not to have disturbed that finding …
Intention
I fully accept that the courts are not normally concerned with what a plaintiff does
with his damages. But it does not follow that intention is not relevant to
reasonableness, at least in those cases where the plaintiff does not intend to
reinstate. Suppose in the present case Mr Forsyth had died, and the action had
been continued by his executors. Is it to be supposed that they would be able to
recover the cost of reinstatement, even though they intended to put the property on
the market without delay? … In the present case the judge found as a fact that Mr
Forsyth’s stated intention of rebuilding the pool would not persist for long after the
litigation had been concluded. In these circumstances it would be ‘mere pretence’
to say that the cost of rebuilding the pool is the loss which he has in fact suffered.
… Does Mr Forsyth’s undertaking to spend any damages which he may receive on
rebuilding the pool make any difference? Clearly not. He cannot be allowed to
create a loss, which does not exist, in order to punish the defendants for their
breach of contract. The basic rule of damages, to which exemplary damages are
the only exception, is that they are compensatory not punitive.
Loss of amenity
I turn last to the head of damages under which the judge awarded £2,500. …
Addis
 
v. 
Gramophone Co Ltd
 
established the general rule that in claims for
breach of contract, the plaintiff cannot recover damages for his injured feelings. But
the rule, like most rules, is subject to exceptions. One of the well established
exceptions is when the object of the contract is to afford pleasure, as, for example,
where the plaintiff has booked a holiday with a tour operator. If the tour operator is
in breach of contract by failing to provide what the contract called for, the plaintiff
may recover damages for his disappointment: see 
Jarvis
 
v. 
Swans Tours Ltd
[1973] QB 233 and 
Jackson
 
v. 
Horizon Holidays Ltd
 
[1975] 1 WLR 1468.
This was, as I understand it, the principle which Judge Diamond applied in the
present case. He took the view that the contract was one ‘for the provision of a
pleasurable amenity.’ In the event, Mr Forsyth’s pleasure was not so great as it
would have been if the swimming pool had been 7 feet 6 inches deep. This was a
view which the judge was entitled to take. If it involves a further inroad on the rule
in 
Addis
 
v. 
Gramophone Co Ltd
 
[1909] AC 488, then so be it. But I prefer to regard
it as a logical application or adaptation of the existing exception to a new situation.
I should, however, add this note of warning. Mr Forsyth was, I think, lucky to have
obtained so large an award for his disappointed expectations. But as there was no
criticism from any quarter as to the quantum of the award as distinct from the
underlying principle, it would not be right for your Lordships to interfere with the
judge’s figure.
That leaves one last question for consideration. I have expressed agreement
with the judge’s approach to damages based on loss of amenity on the facts of the
present case. But in most cases such an approach would not be available. What is
then to be the position where, in the case of a new house, the building does not
conform in some minor respect to the contract, as, for example, where there is a
difference in level between two rooms, necessitating a step. Suppose there is no
measurable difference in value of the complete house, and the cost of
reinstatement would be prohibitive. Is there any reason why the court should 
not
award by way of damages for breach of contract some modest sum, not based on
difference in value, but solely to compensate the buyer for his disappointed
expectations? Is the law of damages so inflexible, as I asked earlier, that it cannot
find some middle ground in such a case? I do not give a final answer to that
question in the present case. But it may be that it would have afforded an
alternative ground for justifying the judge’s award of damages. And if the judge had
wanted a precedent, he could have found it in Sir David Cairns’s judgment in 
G.W.
Atkins Ltd
 
v. 
Scott
, 7 Const LJ 215, where, it will be remembered, the Court of
Appeal upheld the judge’s award of £250 for defective tiling. Sir David Cairns said,
at p. 221:
‘There are many circumstances where a judge has nothing but his common sense to guide him in fixing
the quantum of damages, for instance, for pain and suffering, for loss of pleasurable activities or for
inconvenience of one kind or another.’
If it is accepted that the award of £2,500 should be upheld, then that at once
disposes of Mr Jacob’s argument that Mr Forsyth is entitled to the cost of
reinstatement, because he must be entitled to something. But even if he were
entitled to nothing for loss of amenity, or for difference in value, it would not follow
as Mr Jacob argued that he was entitled to the cost of reinstatement. There is no
escape from the judge’s finding of fact that to insist on the cost of reinstatement in
the circumstances of the present case was unreasonable.
I would therefore allow the appeal and restore the judgment of Judge Diamond.

Commentary
There are a number of points to note here. The first is that the defendant’s claim for
damages was made by way of a counterclaim. The initial point taken by the defendant by
way of defence was that he was not liable to pay at all. The rule invoked by the defendant
is often known as the ‘entire contracts’ rule, although the subject matter of the rule is
generally entire obligations rather than entire contracts. A claimant who has partially
performed an obligation which is entire is generally not entitled to payment for his part
performance (see 
Cutter
 
v. 
Powell
 
(1795) 6 TR 320, 
21.6
). The defendant is entitled to
maintain that his obligation to pay does not arise until the claimant has fully performed
his obligation in accordance with the contract. This rule is well established in the books,
although it has been the subject of some criticism on the basis of its tendency to produce
harsh results (see, for example, 
Sumpter
 
v. 
Hedges
 
[1898] 1 QB 673, although for a
defence of the case see B McFarlane and R Stevens, ‘In Defence of 
Sumpter
 
v. 
Hedges
’
(2002) 118 
LQR
 
569). The rule is the subject of some exceptions, one of which is known
as the doctrine of substantial performance. The effect of this exception is to entitle a
claimant who has substantially performed his obligations to recover the contract price
subject to the defendant’s claim for damages for the loss he has suffered as a result of
the claimant’s breach of contract. This rule was applied by the trial judge in 
Ruxley
 
so
that the plaintiffs were held to be entitled to recover the contract price subject to the
defendant’s counterclaim for damages. It was the counterclaim that was the subject
matter of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and then to the House of Lords.
The second point to note is a tactical one. Technically, the award of £2,500 loss of
amenity damages by the trial judge was not in issue in the House of Lords. The decision
that was the subject matter of the appeal to the House of Lords was the Court of
Appeal’s decision that 
the plaintiffs were liable to pay cost of cure damages of £21,560.
The plaintiffs did not seek to challenge the decision of the trial judge that they were
liable for loss of amenity damages of £2,500. In many ways it was not in their interests
to do so. This being the case, the decision in 
Ruxley
 
should not be taken as an authority
on the amount of damages payable in a loss of amenity case. Lord Lloyd clearly thought
that £2,500 was high but, given that the plaintiffs did not dispute the amount, he did
not intervene. The fact that the plaintiffs did not contest their liability to pay £2,500
made their submission to the House of Lords seem more reasonable, in that it enabled
them to submit that their liability was to pay loss of amenity damages but not cost of
cure damages. This tactic pushed counsel for the defendant into an extreme position in
which he, in essence, argued that the judge was not entitled to award loss of amenity
damages, and that the choice which faced the House of Lords was one between
diminution in value (which was zero) and cost of cure. Their Lordships refused to be
boxed into a corner in this way and concluded that it was not the case that they had to
award the defendant everything or nothing at all. They were attracted by the ‘third way’
which enabled them to hold that the plaintiffs were liable to pay the defendant damages
for the loss of amenity which he suffered in not getting the swimming pool for which he
had contracted. Thus, although it was not technically in issue between the parties, the
award of damages for loss of amenity played a critical role in the reasoning of their
Lordships.
This leads us on to the award of damages for ‘loss of amenity’. Lord Mustill and Lord
Lloyd adopted different approaches in relation to this aspect of the claim. Lord Lloyd
took the narrower approach and linked the claim for loss of amenity damages with a line
of cases (to be discussed at 
23.6
) where damages were awarded against a defendant who
failed to provide the plaintiff with the pleasure that he had promised (for example, a
holiday which turned into a disaster as a result of the defendant’s breach of contract).
Lord Mustill adopted a broader approach which did not confine the recovery of loss of
amenity damages to pleasurable amenity cases. His adoption of the concept of the
‘consumer surplus’ has a broader impact in that it would appear to be applicable in any
case in which a consumer puts a higher value on performance than the market value.
Particularly important in this regard is Lord Mustill’s statement that ‘the law must cater
for those occasions where the value of the promise to the promisee exceeds the financial
enhancement of his position which full performance will secure’. This is an explicit
recognition of the fact that parties can and do enter into contracts for reasons other than
to make money and that the law ought to reflect that fact in the approach which it
adopts to the assessment of damages (see to similar effect the judgment of Lord Reed in
One Step (Support) Ltd
 
v.

There is one further question here and that relates to the nature of an award of damages
for ‘loss of amenity’. What exactly is it? Is it a species of non-pecuniary loss? What is the
‘amenity’ which the claimant must have lost?
The fourth point relates to the reasons which led the House of Lords to conclude that
cost of cure damages were unreasonable on the facts of the case. It would appear that
the unreasonableness was attributable to a combination of two factors. First, the cost of
carrying out the repair work was high; second, the work would not have been of benefit
to the defendant. If the defendant had had the pool built to enable him to engage in his
favourite hobby of diving into a swimming pool from a diving board then the result of
the case would, in all probability, have been different. In such a case the difference in
depth would have been material and, indeed, on such facts the defendant might have
been able to resist the plaintiffs’ action for the price on the ground that they had not
substantially performed their obligations under the contract. This balancing exercise is a
difficult one. On the one hand the law does not wish to encourage contractors to render
a performance which is different from that 
which they agreed to supply and then deny
the existence of a liability to pay damages, other than loss of amenity damages. For this
reason, some consumer groups have been critical of the decision in 
Ruxley
—it gives to
contractors a licence to provide a different performance and then offer a trifling sum by
way of loss of amenity damages as compensation. On the other hand, the law does not
generally wish to over-compensate claimants by giving them cost of cure damages in
cases where they do not appear to have any intention of carrying out the repair work.
This in turn raises the difficult question of the role of intention. Their Lordships were
unwilling to allow the defendant in 
Ruxley
 
to turn an undertaking to use the damages in
effecting the repairs into a passport to a claim for substantial damages. Intention was
but one factor to be considered when deciding whether or not it was unreasonable to
allow the party claiming damages to recover damages assessed on a cost of cure basis.
However, the courts may be slow to conclude that the award of cost of cure damages is
unreasonable. The reason for this is that the innocent party is the victim of the breach of
contract and the party in breach is not in a position to ‘place unreasonable obstacles’ in
the way of the innocent party’s recovery of damages.
Three final points can be noted about 
Ruxley
. First, the plaintiffs did not profit as a
result of their breach of contract. This was not a case in which they had built a shallow
pool in order to make a bigger profit. Secondly, 
Ruxley
 
has been the subject of
subsequent judicial analysis by the House of Lords in 
McAlpine
 
v. 
Panatown
, (
23.3.2
)
and in 
Farley
 
v. 
Skinner
 
[2001] UKHL 49, [2002] 2 AC 732, (
23.6
), and so we shall have
cause to return to the case. The third point relates to the question whether or not the
effect of the decision was to protect the defendant’s performance interest. Professor
Friedmann (
23.2
) suggests that it does. He states that 
Ruxley
 
is ‘predicated on the
approach that 
pacta sunt servanda
 
and that the [defendant’s] performance interest
should be protected’. On the other hand, it can be argued that the House of Lords failed
adequately to protect the defendant’s performance interest. The basis for this argument
is that the award did not enable him to obtain the pool for which he contracted. He had
to put up with something less and was given an award of damages to reflect the
disappointment or loss of amenity which he suffered as a result of not getting the
promised contractual performance. In this sense, his full performance interest was not
protected. Against this, it can be argued that English law is not committed to ensuring
that an innocent party receives the actual performance for which he contracted. This is
demonstrated by its reluctance to order a party in breach specifically to perform his
contractual obligations (specific performance is discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 24
).
It is clear that the defendant in 
Ruxley
 
would not have been granted a specific
performance order requiring the plaintiffs to build a pool in accordance with the
contractual specifications. Does the fact that a court would have refused to make a
specific performance order not suggest that the innocent party’s interest is not in actual
performance of the contract but in the financial equivalent of performance, which can be
measured by the diminution or difference in value? Of course it can be argued that it
does not follow from the fact that the innocent party is not entitled to performance from
the party in breach that he is not entitled to recover by way of damages the cost of
obtaining performance from another party, but the fact that the law is not prepared to
commit itself to specific performance as the primary remedy does suggest that its
commitment to ensuring that performance (rather than the economic end-result of
performance) is achieved is less than whole-hearted. In this sense it has been argued
that English law has failed to recognize the value of the right to performance itself rather
than the consequences of performance or the economic end-result of performance (see
generally B Coote, ‘Contract Damages, 
Ruxley
 
and the Performance Interest’ [1997] 
CLJ
537).
23.3.2
 
Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd
 
v.
Panatown Ltd
The question of the extent to which the law protects the performance interest of a
claimant was also directly in issue in the difficult case of 
Alfred McAlpine Construction
Ltd
 
v. 
Panatown Ltd
 
[2001] 1 AC 518, a case which is extracted and discussed in more
detail in the 
online resources
 
which support this book. Here it suffices to outline the
key features of the case. The claim arose out of the construction of a building by the
defendant. The claimant alleged that the building was defective and that the estimated
cost of repairs amounted to some £40 million. The defendant took the point that the
claimant was not entitled to recover substantial damages in respect of any breach of
contract because the claimant did not own the land on which the building was built and
so had not suffered any loss as a result of any breach of contract committed by the
defendant. The claimant was a member of the Unex group of companies and the
company which owned the land, UIPL, was another member of that corporate group.
The House of Lords held, by a majority of 3-2, that the claimant was not entitled to
recover substantial damages.
The claimant’s case was put on two principal grounds. One ground was that the claimant
was entitled to sue and recover damages in respect of the loss suffered by UIPL. This
aspect of the case is discussed in more detail at 
25.3.2.3
. Here it suffices to note that the
claimant’s claim failed because the contracts between the parties had been structured in
such a way as to give to UIPL a limited right of contractual recourse against the
defendant under a duty of care deed (‘DCD’). Under the terms of the DCD the defendant
accepted that it owed a duty of care to UIPL and it also promised to UIPL that it would
exercise all reasonable skill and care in the performance of its duties. Given that UIPL
had its own limited right of recourse under the DCD, it was held that the claimant did
not have a wider right to recover damages in respect of the loss suffered by UIPL. In
other words, it was for UIPL to decide whether or not to exercise such rights as it had
against the defendant and it was not for the claimant to sue and recover damages on
behalf of UIPL.
This leads on to the second ground on which the claim was brought, namely that the
claimant was entitled to recover substantial damages in respect of the loss which it had
suffered as a result of the defendant’s breach of contract. It is this claim that is the
principal focus of our attention. If loss is viewed entirely in financial terms, then it
appeared that the claimant was no worse off as a result of any breach of contract
committed by the defendant. It did not own the land and it incurred no liability towards
UIPL as a result of the defects in the building. Nor had the claimant incurred
expenditure in seeking to repair the defects in the building. So, in what sense was the
claimant worse off as a result of any breach? In so far as there was a concern that UIPL
was left without meaningful redress, one answer to that concern was that any lack of
meaningful redress was a product of the way in which the Unex group had chosen to
structure the transaction and the limited right of redress which it had negotiated for
UIPL against the defendant.
In terms of the identification and definition of any loss suffered by the claimant, the
important point to note is the difference of opinion between the majority and the
minority. The majority was composed of Lord Clyde, Lord Jauncey, and Lord Browne-
Wilkinson. The minority consisted of Lord Goff and Lord Millett. We shall commence
our analysis with the approach adopted by the minority.
In reaching his conclusion that the claimant was entitled to recover substantial damages
in respect of its own loss, Lord Goff made use of an illustration involving a wealthy
philanthropist who contracts for work to be done to the village hall and the work is done
defectively. 
In his judgment it was ‘absurd’ to conclude that the claim of the
philanthropist in such a case would fail because he did not own the land and had not
himself incurred the expense of employing another builder to carry out the remedial
work. He continued by stating that ‘the philanthropist’s cause of action does not depend
on his having actually incurred the financial expense’ because, quoting from the
judgment of Lord Griffiths in 
Linden Garden Trust Ltd
 
v. 
Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd
[1994] 1 AC 85, 95, he had ‘suffered loss because he did not receive the bargain for which
he had contracted’ (see p. 548). On this basis Lord Goff held that the loss which the
claimant had suffered on the facts of 
Panatown
 
was that it did not receive the
performance it was entitled to receive from the defendant under the contract and this
was so notwithstanding the fact that the ownership of the building site was vested in
UIPL. On this basis the claimant was, in his judgment, entitled to recover substantial
damages.
Similarly, Lord Millett (at pp. 588–589) was critical of a narrow approach to the
identification of loss which he stated was a ‘product of the narrow accountants’ balance
sheet quantification of loss which measures the loss suffered by the promisee by the
diminution of his overall financial position resulting from the breach’. Rather than use
this narrow approach, Lord Millett (at pp. 589–590) used the language of ‘defeated
expectations’ or ‘defeated interests’ to describe the loss in respect of which the claimant
was seeking to recover substantial damages. Thus (at p. 589) he saw nothing new in the
‘idea that a contracting party is entitled to damages measured by the value of his own
defeated interest in having the contract performed’. In his judgment (at p. 591) it was no
departure from orthodoxy to conclude that ‘the building employer, whether or not he is
also the owner of the building, is entitled to recover such damages as will put him in a
position to have the building he contracted for’.
This broad approach to the identification of loss did not, however, commend itself to the
majority. Lord Clyde, after referring to the language of defeated expectations, continued
by observing that this terminology seemed to him ‘to be coming very close to a way of
describing a breach of contract’. But, he continued, in an important section of his
judgment:
A breach of contract may cause a loss, but is not in itself a loss in any meaningful sense. When one refers to a
loss in the context of a breach of contract, one is in my view referring to the incidence of some personal or
patrimonial damage.
There appear to be two factors which persuaded the majority to conclude that the
claimant was not entitled to recover substantial damages in respect of its own loss. The
first was that it had not incurred expenditure itself in seeking to repair the defects in the
property. Thus Lord Jauncey stated (at p. 574) that the entitlement of the claimant to
recover substantial damages in a case such as 
Panatown
 
depends upon whether it ‘has
made good or intends to make good the effects of the breach’. His concern here seems to
have been to avoid an ‘uncovenanted’ profit by an employer who seeks to collect
substantial damages but does not intend to take any steps to remedy the breach (and, as
we saw, similar considerations were at work in the judgment of the House of Lords in
Ruxley
). This uncovenanted profit does not arise in the case where expenditure has been
incurred because in such a case there is ‘some personal or patrimonial damage’ in
respect of which the claimant is seeking compensation. It is no doubt correct to state
that a party who has incurred such expenditure has suffered a loss which, subject to the
possible application of the ‘reasonableness’ test in 
Ruxley,
 
should entitle it to recover the
expenditure which has been incurred in repairing the defects. More difficult perhaps is
the reference by Lord Jauncey to the person who ‘intends to make good the effects of the
breach’. How does the court ascertain whether or not the claimant had such an intention
and at what point in time is the intention of the 
claimant a relevant factor? Does an
intention to carry out the works act as a passport to the recovery of the expenditure
incurred or is it the case that, as in 
Ruxley,
 
a reasonableness test will be applied to the
entitlement of the claimant to recover substantial damages? Further, to pick up on the
point made by Lord Goff, if the works have been carried out defectively by the
contractor, why should the employer be required to incur expenditure, or to establish
the existence of an intention to incur such expenditure, before it can recover damages in
respect of the defects in a building for which it has paid and not received in return the
performance for which it contracted? As Lord Millett pointed out (at pp. 592–593), it is
generally of no concern to the law what the claimant proposes to do with the damages
which it is awarded. In his judgment, the intention of the claimant was at most relevant
to ‘the reasonableness or otherwise’ of the claimant’s claim but should play no bigger
role in the decision whether or not to award substantial damages (although he did at a
later point in his judgment acknowledge the need for the remedial work to be carried
out, albeit it was not ‘material’ whether the work was carried out by the claimant or by
some other member of the Unex group).
The second obstacle was the duty of care deed. Thus Lord Browne-Wilkinson could see
no justification for giving to the claimant a right to recover substantial damages given
that the company which owned the land had ‘a direct cause of action under the DCD’.
Lord Clyde also attached importance to this factor, noting that on the facts of the case
‘there was a plain and deliberate course adopted whereby the company with the
potential risk of loss was given a distinct entitlement directly to sue the contractor and
the professional advisers’ and, in such a case, he concluded that ‘in the light of such a
clear and deliberate course I do not consider that an exception can be admitted to the
general rule that substantial damages can only be claimed by a party who has suffered
substantial loss’. Lord Goff, in the minority, was critical of this reasoning stating (at
p.558) that:
I have to say that this is, on its face, a remarkable submission; it is a strange conclusion indeed that the effect of
providing a subsidiary remedy for the owner of the land (UIPL), on a restricted basis (breach of a duty of care),
is that the building employer, who has furnished the consideration for the building, is excluded from pursuing
his remedy in damages under the main contract, which makes elaborate provision, under a standard form
specially adapted for this particular development, for the terms upon which the contractor has agreed to design
and construct the buildings in question.
There is considerable force in the point made by Lord Goff (and see also to similar effect
the judgment of Lord Millett (at pp. 593–596) who took the view that ‘the DCD was
primarily designed to cater for subsequent purchasers’ in the sense that it would give
them a direct right of action against the defendant in the event of a defect appearing in
the building). Further, it may have been the case that those acting for the Unex group
saw in the DCD a means by which an 
additional
 
right of action could be conferred upon
UIPL and subsequent purchasers of the building and they had not anticipated that the
conferral of that right of action would operate in the other direction by depriving the
claimant of the right it would otherwise have had to recover substantial damages. But
the majority saw the ‘clear and deliberate course’ taken by the Unex group in rather
different terms and the desire to avoid giving to the claimant an ‘uncovenanted’ profit
when it had not established its intention to carry out the works led it to adopt what
seems to be a very narrow approach to the identification of loss the effect of which was
to deprive the claimant of the performance for which it contracted and left substantially
unremedied the defendant’s failure to carry out its contractual obligations in relation to
the construction of the building.
23.4
 
The Reliance Interest
A claimant may wish to bring a claim for damages to protect his reliance interest. As
Fuller and Perdue demonstrate, the reliance interest is a somewhat elusive concept.
They adopt an expansive conception of the reliance interest which encompasses ‘losses
involved in foregoing the opportunity to enter other contracts’ (
23.2
). In practice this
takes the reliance interest very close to the performance interest (in that the claimant is
able to recover his loss of profits on any substitute transaction he would have concluded,
rather than his loss of profit on the actual transaction). However, the more widely used
conception of the reliance interest is that it enables the claimant to recover his out-of-
pocket expenditure incurred in the course of performance of the contract.
As Professor Friedmann points out (
23.2
), a party does not enter into a contract in order
to obtain the return of the expenditure which he incurs in the course of performance of
the contract. He enters into a contract in order to obtain the promised performance. Of
course, in most cases the protection of the claimant’s performance interest will include
the protection of his reliance interest on the basis that, in most cases, contracting parties
expect to recoup their outlay and, in addition, make a profit on the transaction. The
performance interest will therefore include reliance expenditure plus the net profit on
the transaction. This being the case, a claimant will have an obvious interest in bringing
a claim to protect his performance interest rather than confine himself to his reliance
interest (which will not include net profit, unless, as per Fuller and Perdue, we allow the
claimant to recover his net profit on a substitute transaction into which he would have
entered but for the contract concluded with the defendant).
The nature of the claim to recover wasted expenditure has proved to be a disputed
matter. As we have noted, Professor Friedmann stated that the reliance interest is not a
contractual interest (see 
23.2
) and Professor Treitel has also maintained that a claim to
recover wasted expenditure is based on a different ‘method’ of compensation to that
which underpins a claim for expectation damages (‘Damages for Breach of Contract in
the High Court of Australia’ (1992) 108 
LQR
 
226, 229). These claims were considered
and rejected by Teare J in 
Omak Maritime Ltd
 
v. 
Mamola Challenger Shipping Co (The
Mamola Challenger)
 
[2010] EWHC 2026 (Comm), [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 47. After
reviewing the authorities, Teare J held that ‘the expectation loss principle underpins the
award of damages in wasted expenditure cases’. On this basis, a claim to recover reliance
losses is a species of expectation loss and it is not ‘fundamentally different’, nor is it
awarded on a different ‘juridical basis of claim’. The essence of his reasoning is to be
found in the following passage:
44. It seems to me that the expectation loss analysis does provide a rational and sensible explanation for the
award of damages in wasted expenditure cases. The expenditure which is sought to be recovered is incurred in
the expectation that the contract will be performed. It therefore appears to me to be rational to have regard to
the position that the claimant would have been in had the contract been performed.
45.
 
If there were an independent principle pursuant to which expenditure incurred in expectation of the
performance of a contract was recoverable without regard to what the position would have been had the
contract been performed the defendant would in effect underwrite the claimant’s decision to enter the contract.
If the contract was unwise from his point of view, because his expenses were likely to exceed any gross profit, it
is difficult to understand why the defendant should pay damages in an amount equal to that expenditure. His
breach has not caused that loss. The claimant’s expenditure should only be recoverable where the likely gross
profit would at least cover that expenditure. …
47.
 
The authorities therefore state a rational and sensible explanation for the view that the expectation loss
principle underpins the award of damages in wasted expenditure cases. In some cases a contract can be shown
to be a bad bargain. In other cases it may not be possible to show one way or the other whether the likely gross
profits would at least equal the expenditure. In that latter type of case the question arises as to which party
should bear the evidential burden of proof. Should the burden be on the claimant to show that the likely profits
would at least equal his expenditure or on the defendant to show that the likely profits would not at least equal
the claimant’s expenditure? The authorities … provide a rational and sensible explanation for the view that that
burden should be on the defendant.
On this view, the law of contract permits a claimant to frame his claim as one for
damages on the reliance basis rather than the expectancy basis (
CCC Films
 
v. 
Impact
Quadrant Films Ltd
 
[1985] QB 16). However, where the claimant chooses to recover
damages assessed on the reliance basis, the defendant is given the opportunity to prove
that the expenditure sought to be recovered would not in any event have been recouped
because, for example, the contract was a loss-making contract.
Generally speaking, however, claimants will wish to bring a claim for damages to protect
their performance interest. The reason for this is that a reliance loss claim will generally
be lower than a claim to protect the performance interest because the former will not
include a claim for loss of profit. When will a claimant wish to bring a claim for his
reliance losses? There are three principal situations. The first is where he cannot prove
his loss of profit. The second is where he wishes to recover damages in respect of his
pre-contract expenditure. The third is where he has entered into a losing bargain
(although, as we shall see, the latter claim is unlikely to succeed). We shall take each
case in turn.
The first example is the case of an extremely speculative transaction. In such a case the
claimant may have to content himself with a claim for his reliance expenditure (see, for
example, 
McRae
 
v. 
Commonwealth Disposals Commission
 
(1951) 84 CLR 377, 
16.4
).
But the courts will generally strive to put a value on the claimant’s performance interest.
In 
Chaplin
 
v. 
Hicks
 
[1911] 2 KB 786 the plaintiff, an aspiring actress, entered into a
competition organized by the defendant, a theatre manager. The prize for the
competition winners was a term of employment with the defendant. The plaintiff won
the first stage of the competition, being selected as one of 50 out of 6,000 entrants to
proceed to the second stage. The second stage involved an interview with each of the 50
successful entrants by the defendant, who would then select 12 eventual winners. In
breach of contract the defendant deprived the plaintiff of a reasonable opportunity of
attending the interview. The plaintiff sued for breach of contract, claiming damages for
the loss of a chance of winning the competition. The defendant argued that the plaintiff
was only entitled to recover nominal damages. The jury awarded the plaintiff damages
of £100. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal but they dismissed the appeal.
Fletcher Moulton LJ stated (at pp. 798–799) that:
Where by contract a man has a right to belong to a limited class of competitors, he is possessed of something of
value, and it is the duty of the jury to estimate the pecuniary value of that advantage, if it is taken from him. The
present case is a typical one. From a body of six 
thousand, who sent in their photographs, a smaller body of fifty
was formed, of which the plaintiff was one, and among that smaller body twelve prizes were allotted for
distribution; by reason of the defendant’s breach of contract she has lost all the advantage of being in the
limited competition, and she is entitled to have her loss estimated. I cannot lay down any rule as to the measure
of damages in such a case; this must be left to the good sense of the jury. They must of course give effect to the
consideration that the plaintiff’s chance is only one out of four and that they cannot tell whether she would have
ultimately proved to be the winner. But having considered all this they may well think that it is of considerable
pecuniary value to have got into so small a class, and they must assess the damages accordingly.
The courts will generally strive to overcome valuation difficulties and will relegate a
claimant to reliance loss damages only in the case where there is no objective basis for
the award of damages designed to protect his performance interest.
The second situation in which a claimant will wish to bring a claim for reliance loss
damages is in the case in which he wishes to recover damages in respect of his pre-
contractual expenditure. An example in this category is provided by the following case:
ANGLIA TELEVISION V. REED
[1972] 1 QB 60, Court of Appeal
The facts are set out in the judgment of Lord Denning MR.
Lord Denning MR
Anglia Television Ltd, the plaintiffs, were minded in 1968 to make a film of a play
for television entitled ‘The Man in the Wood’. It portrayed an American man married
to an English woman. The American has an adventure in an English wood. The
film was to last for 90 minutes. Anglia Television made many arrangements in
advance. They arranged for a place where the play was to be filmed. They
employed a director, a designer and a stage manager, and so forth. They involved
themselves in much expense. All this was done before they got the leading man.
They required a strong actor capable of holding the play together. He was to be on
the scene the whole time. Anglia Television eventually found the man. He was Mr
Robert Reed, the defendant, an American who has a very high reputation as an
actor. He was very suitable for this part. By telephone conversation on August 30,
1968, it was agreed by Mr Reed through his agent that he would come to England
and be available between September 9 and October 11, 1968, to rehearse and
play in this film. He was to get a performance fee of £1,050, living expenses of
£100 a week, his first class fares to and from the United States, and so forth. It was
all subject to the permit of the Ministry of Labour for him to come here. That was
duly given on September 2, 1968. So the contract was concluded. But
unfortunately there was some muddle with the bookings. It appears that Mr Reed’s
agents had already booked him in America for some other play. So on September
3, 1968, the agent said that Mr Reed would not come to England to perform in this
play. He repudiated his contract. Anglia Television tried hard to find a substitute but
could not do so. So on September 11 they accepted his repudiation. They
abandoned the proposed film. They gave notice to the people whom they had
engaged and so forth.
Anglia Television then sued Mr Reed for damages. He did not dispute his
liability, but a question arose as to the damages. Anglia Television do not claim
their profit. They cannot say what their profit would have been on this contract if Mr
Reed had come here and performed it. So, instead of claim for loss of profits, they
claim for the wasted expenditure. They had incurred the director’s fees, the
designer’s fees, the stage manager’s and assistant manager’s fees, and so on. It
comes in all to £2,750. Anglia Television say that all that money was wasted
because Mr Reed did not perform his contract.
Mr Reed’s advisers take a point of law. They submit that Anglia Television
cannot recover for expenditure incurred before the contract was concluded with Mr
Reed. They can only recover the expenditure after the contract was concluded.
They say that the expenditure after the contract was only £854.65, and that is all
that Anglia Television can recover …
I cannot accept the proposition as stated. It seems to me that a plaintiff in such
a case as this has an election: he can either claim for loss of profits; or for his
wasted expenditure. But he must elect between them. He cannot claim both. If he
has not suffered any loss of profits—or if he cannot prove what his profits would
have been—he can claim in the alternative the expenditure which has been thrown
away, that is, wasted, by reason of the breach. That is shown by 
Cullinane
 
v.
British ‘Rema’ Manufacturing Co Ltd
 
[1954] 1 QB 292, 303, 308.
If the plaintiff claims the wasted expenditure, he is not limited to the expenditure
incurred after the contract was concluded. He can claim also the expenditure
incurred before the contract, provided that it was such as would reasonably be in
the contemplation of the parties as likely to be wasted if the contract was broken.
Applying that principle here, it is plain that, when Mr Reed entered into this
contract, he must have known perfectly well that much expenditure had already
been incurred on director’s fees and the like. He must have contemplated—or, at
any rate, it is reasonably to be imputed to him—that if he broke his contract, all that
expenditure would be wasted, whether or not it was incurred before or after the
contract. He must pay damages for all the expenditure so wasted and thrown
away. … It is true that, if the defendant had never entered into the contract, he
would not be liable, and the expenditure would have been incurred by the plaintiff
without redress; but, the defendant having made his contract and broken it, it does
not lie in his mouth to say he is not liable, when it was because of his breach that
the expenditure has been wasted.
I think the master was quite right and this appeal should be dismissed.
Phillimore
 
and 
Megaw LJJ
 
concurred.
Commentary
Three points of interest arise from this case. First, one of the reasons why the plaintiffs
brought a claim for reliance loss damages was that they could not prove what their loss
of profit would have been. Secondly, the decision has been criticized in so far as it
enables a claimant to recover damages in respect of pre-contractual expenditure.
Professor Ogus (‘Damages for Pre-Contract Expenditure’ (1972) 35 
MLR
 
423, 424)
stated that the proposition that such damages are recoverable is a ‘doubtful proposition’.
He continued:
The measure of damages so envisaged would not put the plaintiffs in the position they would have been in if the
contract had not been made, for the expenses would still have been incurred. The expenses were incurred not in
reliance on the defendant’s promise to perform—they were incurred merely in the hope that agreement with the
defendant would be secured. There was indeed no causal connection between the loss (the wasted expenses)
and either 
the making of the contract or its breach. In the United States of America these theoretical objections
have proved decisive: all attempts to recover pre-contract expenditure (where there was no special agreement
binding the defaulting party to pay) have failed.
Now it may be conceded that dogmatically to insist that there may be recovery of expenditure incurred only
from the moment that the contract was complete may lead to artificial results. If the parties have clearly reached
agreement on the substance of the contract and all that remains is for their legal advisers to draft and execute
the contract, it would be unfair to the plaintiff to disallow a claim for expenses incurred at this stage. On the
other hand, the doctrine of 
restitutio in integrum
 
which lies at the heart of the reliance interest award surely
dictates that while a contract is still being negotiated a party who incurs expenditure does so at his own risk.
Perhaps the best solution would be for the reliance interest award to comprise those expenses incurred as from
the time when there was 
substantial agreement between the parties
.
Thirdly, Lord Denning MR suggested that a claimant must elect between a claim for
reliance loss damages and damages to protect his performance interest: he cannot claim
both. The use of the word ‘election’ is, perhaps, unfortunate in this context. It does not
mean that the claimant must elect between two inconsistent remedies or courses of
action. It simply means that ‘a claimant may choose to frame his claim for damages on
the reliance basis rather than on the expectancy basis’ (
Omak Maritime Ltd
 
v. 
Mamola
Challenger Shipping Co (The Mamola Challenger)
 
[2010] EWHC 2026 (Comm), [2011]
1 Lloyd’s Rep 47, [52]). While a claimant cannot recover both his reliance loss and his
gross profit (because that would involve an element of double recovery), a claimant
should be able to combine a claim for reliance loss with a claim for net profit. In such a
case there is no element of double recovery and so it should be possible to combine these
claims (see Treitel, 
The Law of Contract
 
(15th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited by
Edwin Peel), para 20–038).
The final situation in which a claimant may wish to bring a claim for reliance loss
damages is where he has entered into a bad bargain. However the courts will not, in
general, allow a claimant to use a claim for reliance losses as an escape route from what
has turned out to be a bad bargain. This is demonstrated by the following case:
C & P HAULAGE V. MIDDLETON
[1983] 1 WLR 1461, Court of Appeal
The plaintiffs granted the defendant a contractual licence to use the plaintiffs’
premises for the defendant’s business on a renewable six-month basis. The
licence provided that any fixtures added to the premises by the licence holder
could not be removed upon the termination of the licence. Despite this, the
defendant incurred expense in making improvements to the premises in order to
make them suitable for his business. Ten weeks before the end of a six-month
period, the defendant was unlawfully ejected from the premises by the plaintiffs.
The defendant secured temporary permission from the local authority to use the
garage of his home as his place of work. The defendant used his home in this
manner until well after the six-month period would have expired. The plaintiffs
brought an action against the defendant in relation to a cheque that had been
stopped by the defendant. The 
defendant counterclaimed for damages for the cost
of the improvements he had made to the premises and the appeal to the Court of
Appeal was solely concerned with the counterclaim. At first instance, it was held
that the defendant had suffered no loss as he had been able to move the business
into his home where he did not have to pay any rent and the cost of improvements
to the premises would have been lost in any event when the licence lawfully
terminated after six months. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal who
dismissed his appeal.
Ackner LJ
[set out the facts of the case, considered the decision of the Court of Appeal in
Anglia Television
 
v. 
Reed
 
(earlier in this section) and continued]
The case which I have found of assistance—and I am grateful to counsel for
their research—is a case in the British Columbia Supreme Court: 
Bowlay Logging
Ltd
 
v. 
Domtar Ltd
 
[1978] 4 WWR 105. Berger J, in a very careful and detailed
judgment, goes through various English and American authorities and refers to the
leading textbook writers, and I will only quote a small part of his judgment. At the
bottom of p. 115 he refers to the work of Professor LL Fuller and William R Perdue,
Jr, in ‘The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages: 1’ (1936), 46 
Yale Law Journal
52 and their statement, at p. 79:
‘We will not in a suit for reimbursement for losses incurred in reliance on a contract knowingly put the
plaintiff in a better position than he would have occupied had the contract been fully performed.’
Berger J, at p. 116, then refers to 
L Albert & Son
 
v. 
Armstrong Rubber Co
 
(1949)
178 F 2d 182 in which Learned Hand CJ, speaking for the Circuit Court of Appeals,
Second Circuit:
‘held that on a claim for compensation for expenses in part performance the defendant was entitled to
deduct whatever he could prove the plaintiff would have lost if the contract had been fully performed.’
What Berger J had to consider was this, p. 105:
‘The parties entered into a contract whereby the plaintiff would cut timber under the defendant’s timber
sale, and the defendant would be responsible for hauling the timber away from the site of the timber
sale. The plaintiff claimed the defendant was in breach of the contract as the defendant had not supplied
sufficient trucks to make the plaintiff’s operation, which was losing money, viable, and claimed not for
loss of profits but for compensation for expenditures. The defendant argued that the plaintiff’s operation
lost money not because of a lack of trucks but because of the plaintiff’s inefficiency, and, further, that
even if the defendant had breached the contract the plaintiff should not be awarded damages because
its operation would have lost money in any case.’
This submission was clearly accepted because the plaintiff was awarded only
nominal damages, and Berger J said, at p. 117:
‘The law of contract compensates a plaintiff for damages resulting from the defendant’s breach; it does
not compensate a plaintiff for damages resulting from his making a bad bargain. Where it can be seen
that the plaintiff would have incurred a loss on the contract as a whole, the expenses he has incurred are
losses flowing from entering into the contract, not losses flowing from the defendant’s breach. In these
circumstances, the true consequence of the defendant’s breach is that the plaintiff is released from his
obligation to complete the contract—or in other words, he is saved from incurring further losses. If the
law of contract were to move from compensating for the consequences of breach to compensating for
the consequences of entering into contracts, the law would run contrary to the normal expectations of
the world of commerce. The burden of risk would be shifted from the plaintiff to the defendant. The
defendant would become the insurer of the plaintiff’s enterprise. Moreover, the amount of the damages
would increase not in relation to the gravity or consequences of the breach but in relation to the
inefficiency with which the plaintiff carried out the contract. The greater his expenses owing to
inefficiency, the greater the damages. The fundamental principle upon which damages are measured
under the law of contract is restitutio in integrum. The principle contended for here by the plaintiff would
entail the award of damages not to compensate the plaintiff but to punish the defendant.’
It is urged here that the garage itself was merely an element in the defendant’s
business; it was not a profit-making entity on its own. Nevertheless, if as a result of
being kept out of these premises the defendant had found no other premises to go
to for a period of time, his claim would clearly have been a claim for such loss of
profit as he could establish his business suffered.
In my judgment, the approach of Berger J is the correct one. It is not the
function of the courts where there is a breach of contract knowingly, as this would
be the case, to put a plaintiff in a better financial position than if the contract had
been properly performed. In this case the defendant who is the plaintiff in the
counterclaim, if he was right in his claim, would indeed be in a better position
because … had the contract been lawfully determined as it could have been in the
middle of December, there would have been no question of his recovering these
expenses. …
I do not consider that a plaintiff is entitled in an action for damages for breach of
contract to ask to be put in the position in which he would have been if the contract
had never been made. Accordingly, save in the respect to which I have already
made reference, namely that there should be judgment for the defendant for
nominal damages of £10, I would dismiss the appeal.
Fox LJ
The present case seems to me to be quite different both from 
Anglia Television Ltd
v. 
Reed
 
[1972] 1 QB 60 and from 
Lloyd
 
v. 
Stanbury
 
[1971] 1 WLR 535 in that while
it is true that the expenditure could in a sense be said to be wasted in
consequence of the breach of contract, it was equally likely to be wasted if there
had been no breach, because the plaintiffs wanted to get the defendant out and
could terminate the licence at quite short notice. A high risk of waste was from the
very first inherent in the nature of the contract itself, breach or no breach. The
reality of the matter is that the waste resulted from what was, on the defendant’s
side, a very unsatisfactory and dangerous bargain.
I agree with Ackner LJ that the appeal must be dismissed.
Commentary
The Court of Appeal held that the defendant’s loss flowed, not from the breach of
contract, but from the fact that he had entered into a bad bargain. The court refused to
re-distribute the contractual allocation of risk on the ground that the plaintiffs had
committed a repudiatory breach of contract. But it is important to note that it is the
party in breach who 
bears the burden of proving that the bargain was a losing one for
the innocent party. The law of contract, using what Leggatt J has termed ‘the principle of
reasonable assumptions’ (
Yam Seng Pte Ltd
 
v. 
International Trade Corporation Ltd
[2013] EWHC 111 (QB), [2013] 1 All ER (Comm) 1321, [188]), presumes that a party will
recoup his expenditure and so throws on to the party in breach the burden of proving
that this was not, in fact, the case (see 
Commonwealth of Australia
 
v. 
Amann Aviation
Pty Ltd
 
(1991) 66 ALJR 123). This burden is not an easy one for the party in breach to
discharge, given that it must prove that the gross returns which the innocent party
expected to generate from the contract would not be sufficient to recoup its expenditure
(
Grange
 
v. 
Quinn
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 24, [2013] 1 P & CR 279, [102]). This being the case,
the innocent party will generally be able to recover his wasted expenditure unless, as
was the case in 
C & P Haulage
, it is clear from the facts that the innocent party would
not have been able to recoup his expenditure.
Another example of a case in which the claimant was held not to be entitled to recover
its wasted expenditure is 
Omak Maritime Ltd
 
v. 
Mamola Challenger Shipping Co (The
Mamola Challenger)
 
[2010] EWHC 2026 (Comm), [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 47. A charterer
of a vessel committed a repudiatory breach of a charterparty. The unusual feature of the
case was that the market rate of hire was significantly higher than the contract rate so
that, on termination of the contract following the repudiatory breach, the owners of the
vessel were able to earn about $7,500 per day more than they would have earned under
the charterparty. Nevertheless, the owners brought a claim for damages in which they
sought to recover wasted expenditure which they had incurred in preparing the vessel
for the charterers. Teare J concluded that to award substantial damages, measured by
wasted expenditure, where the owners had, as a result of the charterer’s breach, been
able to trade its vessel at the higher market rates and more than made good their loss,
was wrong in principle because it would put the owners in a better position than the one
they would have occupied had the contract been performed according to its terms.
23.5
 
The Restitution Interest
Fuller and Perdue conclude (see 
23.2
) that the restitution interest presents the strongest
claim for protection because there is both a benefit to the defendant and a loss to the
claimant. But in fact the law of restitution plays a residual role in breach of contract
claims. In particular, it has no role to play unless and until the contract between the
parties is set aside. In the case where the contract has not been set aside, the contract
governs the rights and remedies of the parties.
Where the contract is set aside as a result of the claimant’s acceptance of the defendant’s
repudiatory breach, the claimant may have a claim to recover the value of any benefit
conferred upon the defendant in the course of performance prior to the termination of
the contract. But the right is only available within narrow confines. Where the claim is
one to recover money paid to the defendant, it is only available where there has been a
total failure of consideration, that is to say where the claimant has received no part of
the performance for which he contracted (
Giles
 
v. 
Edwards
 
(1797) 7 Term Rep 181).
Where he has received part of the promised performance, he is confined to a claim for
contractual damages (that is, the protection of his performance interest or, if
appropriate, his reliance interest) unless the benefit which he has received is incidental
or collateral to the bargained-for performance or the consideration is severable and
there has been a total failure in respect of a severable part of that consideration (
Van der
Garde
 
v. 
Force India Formula One Team Ltd
 
[2010] EWHC 
2373 (QB), [2010] All ER
(D) 122 (Sep)). The situation in which a claimant will particularly wish to recover his
money is in the case where he has entered into a bad bargain. Suppose a party enters
into a contract under which he pays £500 for goods that are worth only £300. In breach
of contract, the defendant fails to supply the goods. In such a case the claimant is not
confined to the protection of his performance interest (£300) but can claim the return of
his £500 on the ground that it was paid for a consideration which totally failed. In this
way the claim to recover upon a total failure of consideration has the effect of rescuing
the claimant from his bad bargain. The rule that money paid can only be recovered upon
a total failure of consideration has been criticized by many academic commentators on
the law of restitution (see, for example, P Birks, ‘Failure of Consideration’ in FD Rose
(ed), 
Consensus Ad Idem: Essays on the Law of Contract
 
(Sweet & Maxwell, 1996), p.
179). The generally accepted view among restitution scholars today is that money paid
should be recoverable upon a failure of consideration, whether that failure is total or
partial. But, despite the occasional judicial hint that the courts will allow a claim to
recover based on a partial failure of consideration (see, for example, 
Goss
 
v. 
Chilcott
[1996] AC 788, 798), the total failure requirement remains part of the law.
In the case where the innocent party has supplied goods or services to the party in
breach prior to the termination of the contract, there is no total failure requirement.
Total failure of consideration applies only to claims to recover money paid to the
defendant. A claimant who wishes to recover the reasonable value of goods or services
supplied prior to termination can either pursue a contractual claim or bring a
restitutionary claim (usually referred to as a 
quantum meruit
 
or a 
quantum valebat
claim) for the reasonable value of the services provided or goods supplied (see, for
example, 
Planché
 
v. 
Colburn
 
(1831) 8 Bing 14). The vital issue in this connection is not
the existence of the restitutionary claim but the measure of recovery, in particular the
question whether the contract price acts as a ceiling on the value of the claimant’s
restitutionary claim. There is much to be said for the view that the claimant should not
be entitled to rely on the defendant’s breach of contract for the purpose of reversing the
contractual allocation of risk and recovering a sum in excess of the contract price (and
this view was essentially adopted by the High Court of Australia in 
Mann
 
v. 
Paterson
Constructions Pty Ltd
 
[2019] HCA 32, [2020] BLR 156), but the authorities, such as
they are, appear to lend some support for the proposition that the claimant can, in a
restitutionary claim, recover a sum in excess of the contract price (
Lodder
 
v. 
Slowey
[1904] AC 442 and 
Rover International Ltd
 
v. 
Cannon Film Sales Ltd (No 3)
 
[1989] 1
WLR 912).
One final point remains to be made. The cases discussed in this section are cases in
which there is a precise correlation between the gain to the defendant and the loss to the
claimant; the one is the mirror image of the other. A separate issue arises in the case
where the defendant makes a profit from his breach of contract and that profit exceeds
the loss that has been suffered by the claimant. The question of the extent to which a
claimant can recover such a gain from a party in breach of contract is discussed at 
23.9
.
23.6
 
Non-Pecuniary Losses
It is clear law that damages can be recovered for physical injury suffered by the claimant
as a result of the defendant’s breach of contract provided that the loss is not too remote
a consequence of the breach of contract (see, for example, 
Grant
 
v. 
Australian Knitting
Mills Ltd
 
[1936] AC 85). More difficult is the case in which the claimant suffers physical
inconvenience 
or ‘mental distress’ as a result of the breach. The leading modern
authority on the latter issue is the following decision of the House of Lords:
FARLEY V. SKINNER
[2001] UKHL 49, [2002] 2 AC 732, House of Lords
The plaintiff employed the defendant surveyor to survey a ‘gracious country
residence’ which the plaintiff was contemplating buying as a weekend residence.
Given that the property was situated some 15 miles from Gatwick airport, the
plaintiff expressly asked the defendant to report on whether or not aircraft noise
was likely to be a problem. The defendant did so and reported that it was ‘unlikely
that the property will suffer greatly from such noise, although some planes will
inevitably cross the area, depending on the direction of the wind and the
positioning of the flight paths’. The plaintiff purchased the house and, after
spending in excess of £100,000 in carrying out improvements, he discovered that
aircraft noise was indeed a problem for him and that it interfered with his
enjoyment of the house. The house was not far from Mayfield Stack, where
aeroplanes waiting to land at Gatwick are stacked until a landing slot becomes
available (the stacking tends to take place during busy periods, namely in the
morning, early evening, and at weekends). The plaintiff sued the defendant for
damages, alleging that he had been negligent in carrying out his obligations under
the contract. The trial judge found that the defendant was in breach of contract. He
held that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages on a diminution in value
basis because he found that the property was not worth any less as a result of the
defendant’s failure to point out to the plaintiff the true position in relation to aircraft
‘(1)
(2)
(3)
noise. Instead, he awarded the plaintiff damages of £10,000 for the distress and
inconvenience caused to him by the aircraft noise. The defendant appealed to the
Court of Appeal where it was held that the plaintiff had not suffered any physical
discomfort and inconvenience as a result of the defendant’s breach of contract and
that the object of the contract between the parties was not to provide enjoyment or
relief from stress so that the claim did not fall within the class of case in respect of
which it was appropriate to award damages for distress and inconvenience. The
defendant’s appeal was therefore allowed and it was held that the plaintiff was
entitled to recover nominal damages only. The plaintiff appealed to the House of
Lords. His appeal was allowed and he was held to be entitled to damages of
£10,000.
Lord Steyn
14. The judgments in the Court of Appeal and the arguments before the House
took as their starting point the propositions enunciated by Bingham LJ in 
Watts
 
v.
Morrow
 
[1991] 1 WLR 1421. In that case the Court of Appeal had to consider a
claim for damages for distress and inconvenience by a buyer of a house against
his surveyor who had negligently failed to report defects in the house. Bingham LJ
observed, at p. 1445:
A contract-breaker is not in general liable for any distress, frustration,
anxiety, displeasure, vexation, tension or aggravation which his breach of
contract may cause to the innocent party. This rule is not, I think, founded
on the assumption that such reactions are not foreseeable, which they
surely are or may be, but on considerations of policy.
But the rule is not absolute. Where the very object of a contract is to
provide pleasure, relaxation, peace of mind or freedom from molestation,
damages will be awarded if the 
fruit of the contract is not provided or if the
contrary result is procured instead. If the law did not cater for this
exceptional category of case it would be defective. A contract to survey the
condition of a house for a prospective purchaser does not, however, fall
within this exceptional category.
In cases not falling within this exceptional category, damages are in my
view recoverable for physical inconvenience and discomfort caused by the
breach and mental suffering directly related to that inconvenience and
discomfort. If those effects are foreseeably suffered during a period when
defects are repaired I am prepared to accept that they sound in damages
even though the cost of the repairs is not recoverable as such. But I also
agree that awards should be restrained, and that the awards in this case far
exceeded a reasonable award for the injury shown to have been suffered.’
(Numbering introduced) …
15. But useful as the observations of Bingham LJ undoubtedly are, they were
never intended to state more than broad principles. … Specifically, it is important to
bear in mind that 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
 
[1991] 1 WLR 1421 was a case where a
surveyor negligently failed to discover defects in a property. The claim was not for
breach of a specific undertaking to investigate a matter important for the buyer’s
peace of mind. It was a claim for damages for inconvenience and discomfort
resulting from breach. In 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
 
[1991] 1 WLR 1421 therefore there was
no reason to consider the case where a surveyor is in breach of a distinct and
important contractual obligation which was intended to afford the buyer information
confirming the presence or absence of an intrusive element before he committed
himself to the purchase.
V.
 
Recovery of non-pecuniary damages
16. … In the law of obligations the rules governing the recovery of compensation
necessarily distinguish between different kinds of harm. … In contract law
distinctions are made about the kind of harm which resulted from the breach of
contract. The general principle is that compensation is only awarded for financial
loss resulting from the breach of contract: 
Livingstone
 
v. 
Rawyards Coal Co
 
(1880)
5 App Cas 25, 39, per Lord Blackburn. In the words of Bingham LJ in 
Watts
 
as a
matter of legal policy ‘a contract breaker is not 
in general
 
liable for any distress,
frustration, anxiety, displeasure, vexation, tension or aggravation which his breach
of contract may cause to the innocent party’ (my emphasis). There are, however,
limited exceptions to this rule. One such exception is damages for pain, suffering
and loss of amenities caused to an individual by a breach of contract: see
McGregor 
On Damages
, 16th ed, para 96, pp. 56–57. It is not material in the
present case. But the two exceptions mentioned by Bingham LJ, namely where the
very object of the contract is to provide pleasure (proposition (2)) and recovery for
physical inconvenience caused by the breach (proposition (3)), are pertinent. The
scope of these exceptions is in issue in the present case. It is, however, correct, as
counsel for the surveyor submitted, that the entitlement to damages for mental
distress caused by a breach of contract is not established by mere foreseeability:
the right to recovery is dependent on the case falling fairly within the principles
governing the special exceptions. So far there is no real disagreement between the
parties.
VI.
 
The very object of the contract: The framework
17. I reverse the order in which the Court of Appeal considered the two issues. I do
so because the issue whether the present case falls within the exceptional
category governing cases where the very object of the contract is to give pleasure,
and so forth, focuses directly on the terms actually agreed between the parties. It
is concerned with the reasonable expectations of the parties under the specific
terms of the contract. Logically, it must be considered first.
18.
 
It is necessary to examine the case on a correct characterisation of the
plaintiff’s claim. … The plaintiff made it crystal clear to the surveyor that the impact
of aircraft noise was a matter of importance to him. Unless he obtained reassuring
information from the surveyor he would not have bought the property. That is the
tenor of the evidence. It is also what the judge found. The case must be
approached on the basis that the surveyor’s obligation to investigate aircraft noise
was a major or important part of the contract between him and the plaintiff. It is
also important to note that, unlike in 
Addis
 
v. 
Gramophone Co Ltd
 
[1909] AC 488,
the plaintiff’s claim is not for injured feelings caused by the breach of contract.
Rather it is a claim for damages flowing from the surveyor’s failure to investigate
and report, thereby depriving the buyer of the chance of making an informed
choice whether or not to buy resulting in mental distress and disappointment.
19.
 
The broader legal context of 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
 
[1991] 1 WLR 1421 must be
borne in mind. The exceptional category of cases where the very object of a
contract is to provide pleasure, relaxation, peace of mind or freedom from
molestation is not the product of Victorian contract theory but the result of
evolutionary developments in case-law from the 1970s. Several decided cases
informed the description given by Bingham LJ of this category. The first was the
decision of the sheriff court in 
Diesen
 
v. 
Samson
 
1971 SLT (Sh Ct) 49. A
photographer failed to turn up at a wedding, thereby leaving the couple without a
photographic record of an important and happy day. The bride was awarded
damages for her distress and disappointment. In the celebrated case of 
Jarvis
 
v.
Swans Tours Ltd
 
[1973] QB 233, the plaintiff recovered damages for mental
distress flowing from a disastrous holiday resulting from a travel agent’s negligent
representations: compare also 
Jackson
 
v. 
Horizon Holidays Ltd
 
[1975] 1 WLR
1468. In 
Heywood
 
v. 
Wellers
 
[1976] QB 446, the plaintiff instructed solicitors to
bring proceedings to restrain a man from molesting her. The solicitors negligently
failed to take appropriate action with the result that the molestation continued. The
Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiff damages for mental distress and upset. …
20.
 
At their Lordships’ request counsel for the plaintiff produced a
memorandum based on various publications which showed the impact of the
developments already described on litigation in the county courts. Taking into
account the submissions of counsel for the surveyor and making due allowance for
a tendency of the court sometimes not to distinguish between the cases presently
under consideration and cases of physical inconvenience and discomfort, I am
satisfied that in the real life of our lower courts non-pecuniary damages are
regularly awarded on the basis that the defendant’s breach of contract deprived the
plaintiff of the very object of the contract, viz pleasure, relaxation, and peace of
mind. The cases arise in diverse contractual contexts, eg the supply of a wedding
dress or double glazing, hire purchase transactions, landlord and tenant, building
contracts, and engagements of estate agents and solicitors. The awards in such
cases seem modest. For my part what happens on the ground casts no doubt on
the utility of the developments since the 1970s in regard to the award of non-
pecuniary damages in the exceptional categories. But the problem persists of the
precise scope of the exceptional category of case involving awards of non-
pecuniary damages for breach of contract where the very object of the contract
was to ensure a party’s pleasure, relaxation or peace of mind.
21.
 
An important development for this branch of the law was 
Ruxley
Electronics and Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Forsyth
 
[1996] AC 344 …
[He set out the facts and continued]
I am satisfied that the principles enunciated in Ruxley’s case in support of the
award of £2,500 for a breach of respect of the provision of a pleasurable amenity
have been authoritatively established.
VII.
 
The very object of the contract: The arguments against the
plaintiff’s claim
22. Counsel for the surveyor advanced three separate arguments each of which he
said was sufficient to defeat the plaintiff’s claim. First, he submitted that even if a
major or important part of the contract was to give pleasure, relaxation and peace
of mind, that was not enough. It is an indispensable requirement that the object of
the entire contract must be of this type. Secondly, he submitted that the
exceptional category does not extend to a breach of a contractual duty of care,
even if imposed to secure pleasure, relaxation and peace of mind. It only covers
cases where the promiser guarantees achievement of such an object. Thirdly, he
submitted that by not moving out of Riverside House the plaintiff forfeited any right
to recover non-pecuniary damages.
23.
 
The first argument fastened onto a narrow reading of the words ‘the very
object of [the] contract’ as employed by Bingham LJ in 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
 
[1991] 1
WLR 1421, 1445. … It is difficult to see what the principled justification for such a
limitation might be. …
24. …
 
There is no reason in principle or policy why the scope of recovery in
the exceptional category should depend on the object of the contract as
ascertained from all its constituent parts. It is sufficient if a major or important
object of the contract is to give pleasure, relaxation or peace of mind. …
25.
 
That brings me to the second issue, namely whether the plaintiff’s claim is
barred by reason of the fact that the surveyor undertook an obligation to exercise
reasonable care and did not guarantee the achievement of a result. … But why
should this difference between an absolute and relative contractual promise
require a distinction in respect of the recovery of non-pecuniary damages? Take
the example of a travel agent who is consulted by a couple who are looking for a
golfing holiday in France. Why should it make a difference in respect of the
recoverability of non-pecuniary damages for a spoiled holiday whether the travel
agent gives a guarantee that there is a golf course very near the hotel, represents
that to be the case, or negligently advises that all hotels of the particular chain of
hotels are situated next to golf courses? If the nearest golf course is in fact 50
miles away a breach may be established. It may spoil the holiday of the couple. It
is difficult to see why in principle only those plaintiffs who negotiate guarantees
may recover non-pecuniary damages for a breach of contract … I am satisfied that
it is not the law. In my view the distinction drawn … between contractual
guarantees and obligations of reasonable care is unsound …
VIII.
 
Quantum
28. In the surveyor’s written case it was submitted that the award of £10,000 was
excessive. It was certainly high. Given that the plaintiff is stuck indefinitely with a
position which he sought to avoid by the terms of his contract with the surveyor I
am not prepared to interfere with the judge’s evaluation on the special facts of the
case. On the other hand, I have to say that the size of the award appears to be at
the very top end of what could possibly be regarded as appropriate damages. Like
Bingham LJ in 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
 
[1991] 1 WLR 1421, 1445H I consider that awards
in this area should be restrained and modest. It is important that logical and
beneficial developments in this corner of the law should not contribute to the
creation of a society bent on litigation.
IX.
 
Conclusion
29. In agreement with the reasoning of Clarke LJ I would therefore hold that the
decision of the majority in the Court of Appeal was wrong …

30. It is strictly unnecessary to discuss the question whether the judge’s decision
can be justified on the ground that the breach of contract resulted in inconvenience
and discomfort. It is, however, appropriate that I indicate my view. The judge had a
great deal of evidence on aircraft noise at Riverside House. It is conceded that
noise can produce a physical reaction and can, depending on its intensity and the
circumstances, constitute a nuisance. Noise from aircraft is exempted from the
statutory nuisance system and in general no action lies in common law nuisance
by reason only of the flight of aircraft over a property: see section 6(1) of the Civil
Aviation Act 1982 and McCracken, Jones, Pereira & Payne, 
Statutory Nuisance
(2001), para 10.33. The existence of the legislation shows that aircraft noise could
arguably constitute a nuisance. In any event, aircraft noise is capable of causing
inconvenience and discomfort within the meaning of Bingham LJ’s relevant
proposition. It is a matter of degree whether the case passes the threshold. It is
sufficient to say that I have not been persuaded that the judge’s decision on this
point was not open to him on the evidence which he accepted. For this further
reason, in general agreement with Clarke LJ, I would rule that the decision of the
Court of Appeal was wrong.

Disposal
31. I would allow the appeal and restore the judge’s decision.
Lord Clyde
35. … The expression ‘physical inconvenience’ may be traced at least to the
judgment of 
Hobbs
 
v. 
London and South Western Railway Co
 
(1875) LR 10 QB
111, 122, where in that case damages were awarded for the inconvenience
suffered by the plaintiffs for having to walk between four and five miles home as a
result of the train on which they had taken tickets to Wimbledon travelling instead
to Esher. They had tried to obtain a conveyance but found that there was none to
be had. … It does not seem to me that there is any particular magic in the word
‘physical’. It served in 
Hobbs
’s case to emphasise the exclusion of matters purely
sentimental, but it should not require detailed analysis or definition. As matter of
terminology I should have thought that ‘inconvenience’ by itself sufficiently covered
the kinds of difficulty and discomfort which are more than mere matters of
sentimentality, and that ‘disappointment’ would serve as a sufficient label for those
mental reactions which in general the policy of the law will exclude.
36.
 
In 
Hobbs’s
 
case the defendants were prepared to compensate the plaintiffs
for the cost of a conveyance, even although they had not been able to find any. In
the present case the defendant would be prepared to pay for the costs of sale and
removal if the plaintiff had decided to sell because of the noise. It is said by the
respondent that since he has decided to keep the house he is not entitled to any
damages at all. But in 
Hobbs
 
the plaintiffs were entitled to damages in respect of
the inconvenience. It is hard to understand why a corresponding result should not
follow here. That an award may be made in such circumstances is to my mind in
line with the thinking of this House in 
Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd
 
v.
Forsyth
 
[1996] AC 344 …
37.
 
The judge found that the plaintiff was not a man of excessive susceptibility
and he refers to the inconvenience he was suffering as ‘real discomfort’. I do not
consider it appropriate to explore the detail of the inconvenience as being
‘physical’, either because it impacts upon his eardrums, or because it has some
geographical element, such as the relative locations of the aircraft and the
property, or the obviously greater audibility of their movements 
when the plaintiff is
seeking to enjoy the amenity of the terrace and the gardens than when he is inside
the house. In my view the real discomfort which the judge found to exist
constituted an inconvenience to the plaintiff which is not a mere matter of
disappointment or sentiment. It is unnecessary that the noise should be so great
as to make it impossible for the plaintiff to sit at all on his terrace. Plainly it
significantly interferes with his enjoyment of the property and in my view that
inconvenience is something for which damages can and should be awarded …
38. …
 
In my view the appeal can be allowed on the foregoing basis.
39.
 
But it is possible to approach the case as one of the exceptional kind in
which the claim would be for damages for disappointment. If that approach was
adopted so as to seek damages for disappointment, I consider that it should also
succeed.
40.
 
It should be observed at the outset that damages should not be awarded,
unless perhaps nominally, for the fact of a breach of contract as distinct from the
consequences of the breach. That was a point which I sought to stress in
Panatown Ltd
 
v. 
Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd
 
[2001] 1 AC 518. For an award
to be made a loss or injury has to be identified which is a consequence of the
breach but not too remote from it, and which somehow or other can be expressed
and quantified in terms of a sum of money. So disappointment merely at the fact
that the contract has been breached is not a proper ground for an award. The mere
fact of the loss of a bargain should not be the subject of compensation. But that is
not the kind of claim which the plaintiff is making here. What he is seeking is
damages for the inconvenience of the noise, the invasion of the peace and quiet
which he expected the property to possess and the diminution in his use and
enjoyment of the property on account of the aircraft noise. …
42. …
 
The present case is not an ‘ordinary surveyor’s contract’. The request
for the report on aircraft noise was additional to the usual matters expected of a
surveyor in the survey of a property and could properly have attracted an extra fee
if he had spent extra time researching that issue. It is the specific provision relating
to the peacefulness of the property in respect of aircraft noise which makes the
present case out of the ordinary …
44.
 
The object of the request to consider the risk of aircraft noise was very
plainly to enable the plaintiff to determine the extent of the peace and quiet which
he could enjoy at the property. It would be within the contemplation of the
defendant that if the noise was such as to interfere with the occupier’s peaceful
enjoyment of the property the plaintiff would either not buy it at all or live there
deprived of his expectation of peace and quiet. Each of these consequences
seems to me to flow directly from the breach of contract so as to enable an award
of damages to be made on one or other basis. The present case can in my view
qualify as one of the exceptional cases where a contract for peace or pleasure has
been made and breached, thereby entitling the injured party to claim damages for
the disappointment occasioned by the breach.
45.
 
For the foregoing reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the judge’s
award.
Lord Scott of Foscote
79. 
Ruxley’s
 
case establishes, in my opinion, that if a party’s contractual
performance has failed to provide to the other contracting party something to which
that other was, under the contract, entitled, and which, if provided, would have
been of value to that party, then, if there is no other way of compensating the
injured party, the injured party should be compensated in damages to the extent of
that value. Quantification of that value will, in many cases be difficult and may often
seem arbitrary. In 
Ruxley’s
 
case the value placed on the amenity value 
of which
the pool owner had been deprived was £2,500. By that award, the pool owner was
placed, so far as money could do it, in the position he would have been in if the
diving area of the pool had been constructed to the specified depth.
80.
 
In 
Ruxley’s
 
case the breach of contract by the builders had not caused any
consequential loss to the pool owner. He had simply been deprived of the benefit
of a pool built to the depth specified in the contract. It was not a case where the
recovery of damages for consequential loss consisting of vexation, anxiety or other
species of mental distress had to be considered.
81.
 
In 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
 
[1991] 1 WLR 1921, however, that matter did have to
be considered …
[He set out the facts of the case and quoted the passage from the judgment of
Bingham LJ set out at paragraph [14] and continued]
82.
 
In the passage I have cited, Bingham LJ was dealing with claims for
consequential damage consisting of the intangible mental states and sensory
experiences to which he refers. Save for the matters referred in the first paragraph,
all of which reflect or are brought about by the injured party’s disappointment at the
contract breaker’s failure to carry out his contractual obligations, and recovery for
which, if there is nothing more, is ruled out on policy grounds, Bingham LJ’s
approach is, in my view, wholly consistent with established principles for the
recovery of contractual damages.
83.
 
There are, however, two qualifications that I would respectfully make to the
proposition in the final paragraph of the cited passage that damages ‘for physical
inconvenience and discomfort caused by the breach’ are recoverable.
84.
 
First, there will, in many cases, be an additional remoteness hurdle for the
injured party to clear. Consequential damage, including damage consisting of
inconvenience or discomfort, must, in order to be recoverable, be such as, at the
time of the contract, was reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the
breach: …
85.
 
Second, the adjective ‘physical’, in the phrase ‘physical inconvenience and
discomfort’, requires, I think, some explanation or definition. The distinction
between the ‘physical’ and the ‘non-physical’ is not always clear and may depend
on the context. Is being awoken at night by aircraft noise ‘physical’? If it is, is being
unable to sleep because of worry and anxiety ‘physical’? What about a reduction in
light caused by the erection of a building under a planning permission that an
errant surveyor ought to have warned his purchaser-client about but failed to do
so? In my opinion, the critical distinction to be drawn is not a distinction between
the different types of inconvenience or discomfort of which complaint may be made
but a distinction based on the cause of the inconvenience or discomfort. If the
cause is no more than disappointment that the contractual obligation has been
broken, damages are not recoverable even if the disappointment has led to a
complete mental breakdown. But, if the cause of the inconvenience or discomfort
is a sensory (sight, touch, hearing, smell etc) experience, damages can, subject to
the remoteness rules, be recovered.
86.
 
In summary, the principle expressed in 
Ruxley Electronics and
Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Forsyth
 
[1996] AC 344 should be used to provide damages for
deprivation of a contractual benefit where it is apparent that the injured party has
been deprived of something of value but the ordinary means of measuring the
recoverable damages are inapplicable. The principle expressed in 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
[1991] 1 WLR 1421 should be used to determine whether and when contractual
damages for inconvenience or discomfort can be recovered.
87.
 
These principles, in my opinion, provide the answer, not only to the issue
raised in the present case, but also to the issues raised in the authorities which
were cited to your Lordships.
88.
 
In 
Hobbs
 
v. 
London and South Western Railway Co
 
(1875) LR 10 QB 111
the claim was for consequential damage caused by the railway company’s breach
of contract. …
[He set out the facts of the case, on which see paragraph [35], and continued]
This was, in my view, a 
Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Forsyth
[1996] AC 344 case …
[He applied the principles set out in paragraph [86] to a range of cases and
continued]
105.
 
It is time for me to turn to the present case and apply the principles
expressed in 
Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Forsyth
 
[1996] AC 344
and 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
 
[1991] 1 WLR 1421. In my judgment, Mr Farley is entitled to
be compensated for the ‘real discomfort’ that the judge found he suffered. He is so
entitled on either of two alternative bases.
106.
 
First, he was deprived of the contractual benefit to which he was entitled.
He was entitled to information about the aircraft noise from Gatwick bound aircraft
that Mr Skinner, through negligence, had failed to supply him with. If Mr Farley had,
in the event, decided not to purchase Riverside House, the value to him of the
contractual benefit of which he had been deprived would have been nil. But he did
buy the property. And he took his decision to do so without the advantage of being
able to take into account the information to which he was contractually entitled. If
he had had that information he would not have bought. So the information clearly
would have had a value to him. Prima facie, in my opinion, he is entitled to be
compensated accordingly.
107.
 
In these circumstances, it seems to me, it is open to the court to adopt a
Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Forsyth
 
[1996] AC 344 approach and
place a value on the contractual benefit of which Mr Farley has been deprived. In
deciding on the amount, the discomfort experienced by Mr Farley can, in my view,
properly be taken into account. If he had had the aircraft noise information he
would not have bought Riverside House and would not have had that discomfort.
108.
 
Alternatively, Mr Farley can, in my opinion, claim compensation for the
discomfort as consequential loss. Had it not been for the breach of contract, he
would not have suffered the discomfort. It was caused by the breach of contract in
a causa sine qua non sense. Was the discomfort a consequence that should
reasonably have been contemplated by the parties at the time of contract as liable
to result from the breach? In my opinion, it was. It was obviously within the
reasonable contemplation of the parties that, deprived of the information about
aircraft noise that he ought to have had, Mr Farley would make a decision to
purchase that he would not otherwise have made. Having purchased, he would,
having become aware of the noise, either sell—in which case at least the
expenses of the re-sale would have been recoverable as damages—or he would
keep the property and put up with the noise. In the latter event, it was within the
reasonable contemplation of the parties that he would experience discomfort from
the noise of the aircraft. And the discomfort was ‘physical’ in the sense that
Bingham LJ in 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
 
[1991] 1 WLR 1421, 1445 had in mind. In my
opinion, the application of 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
 
principles entitles Mr Farley to damages
for discomfort caused by the aircraft noise.
109.
 
I would add that if there had been an appreciable reduction in the market
value of the property caused by the aircraft noise, Mr Farley could not have
recovered both that difference in value and damages for discomfort. To allow both
would allow double recovery for the same item.
110.
 
Whether the approach to damages is on 
Ruxley Electronics and
Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Forsyth
 
[1996] AC 344 lines, for deprivation of a contractual
benefit, or on 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
 
[1991] 1 WLR 1421 lines, for consequential damage
within the applicable remoteness rules, the appropriate amount should, in my
opinion, be modest. The degree of discomfort experienced by Mr Farley, although
‘real’, was not very great. I think £10,000 may have been on the high side. But in
principle, in my opinion, the judge was right to award damages and I am not, in the
circumstances, disposed to disagree with his figure.
111.
 
For the reasons I have given and for the reasons contained in the opinion
of my noble and learned friend, Lord Steyn, I would allow the appeal and restore
the judge’s order.
Lord Browne-Wilkinson

Commentary
A number of points should be noted about this decision (see further E McKendrick and
M Graham, ‘The Sky’s the Limit: Contractual Damages for Non-Pecuniary Loss’ [2002]
LMCLQ
 
161). The first relates to the conclusion that it is no longer necessary that the
‘object of the contract’ be the provision of pleasure or peace of mind. It now suffices that
the object of the term broken is to provide pleasure or freedom from distress and that
the term is an important one in the context of the contract as a whole. While this is a
welcome development, it may not always be easy to ascertain whether this requirement
has been satisfied on the facts of any given case. Some cases are likely to be relatively
straightforward: for example a contract to take photographs at a wedding (
Diesen
 
v.
Samson
, 1971 SLT (Sh Ct) 49) or to provide a holiday (
Jarvis
 
v. 
Swans Tours Ltd
 
[1973]
QB 233). But others are likely to prove more difficult. An example is 
Hamilton Jones
 
v.
David & Snape (a firm)
 
[2003] EWHC 3147 (Ch), [2004] 1 All ER 657. The claimant,
who was concerned that her husband might remove their children from the jurisdiction,
instructed the defendant solicitors. As a result of the solicitors’ negligence, her husband
was able to abduct their sons to Tunisia, where he was awarded custody. Neuberger J
held that the claimant was entitled to recover damages of £20,000 in respect of the
distress which she had suffered. The claimant had, and was perceived by the defendants
to have had, ‘her own peace of mind and pleasure in the company of her children as an
important factor’ when entering into the contract with the defendants. Contracts with
surveyors have also given rise to difficulty in this respect. There appears to be a
distinction between an ‘ordinary surveyor’s contract’, which the House of Lords in
Farley
 
held does not fall within this category, and the contract in 
Farley
, which did (see
[42]). The distinction between the two cases would appear to rest on the fact that the
plaintiff in 
Farley
 
specifically asked the surveyor to investigate noise levels from aircraft
(see [15]). Yet why should the plaintiff have to ask for peace of mind in this respect? Is it
not implicit in every contract with a surveyor that the house owner is seeking peace of
mind?
The second point relates to the recovery of damages for inconvenience and discomfort.
Lord Clyde held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages on the basis of the
inconvenience and discomfort that he suffered as a result of the defendant’s breach. This
was Lord Clyde’s primary ground for his decision (see [37]–[39]), whereas for the others
it was their secondary ground. The difficulty here relates to the scope of the category.
How far does it extend and how does one distinguish between inconvenience (which
falls within its scope) and disappointment (which does not)? Inconvenience is not easy
to define. The definition adopted by Lord Scott, which places emphasis on the existence
of a ‘sensory’ cause of the inconvenience or discomfort (see [85]), may prove to be a
workable definition in many cases. Further, Lord Steyn’s reference to the law of
nuisance (in [30]) has the advantage of tapping into an established body of case-law. On
the other hand, Lord Clyde found it unnecessary 
([35]) to provide a ‘detailed analysis or
definition’ of inconvenience. For him, ‘inconvenience’ was to be distinguished from the
‘purely sentimental’. The aircraft noise fell into the former category since it ‘significantly
interfered’ with the plaintiff’s use of his property. Of the four speeches, only Lord Scott
purported to draw a principled distinction between disappointment and inconvenience,
the others being prepared only to identify ‘inconvenience’ on the facts of the particular
case.
A related difficulty is that inconvenience and discomfort are highly subjective in nature.
In this respect 
Farley
 
may be close to the line. As Lord Scott observed (at [68]), there
was ‘evidence that many, perhaps most, of the residents in the area were not troubled by
the noise’. But the test for the existence of discomfort does not appear to be an objective
one: it contains a significant subjective element in that regard must be had to the
plaintiff’s mode of life. In the present case the plaintiff was in the habit of enjoying ‘a
quiet, reflective breakfast, a morning stroll in his garden’, and pre-dinner drinks on the
terrace and all three activities were interfered with by the noise from the aircraft. Will
this subjective approach to the identification of inconvenience open the floodgates to
claims of this type? Probably not. Liability will be contained by the remoteness rules (on
which see 
23.8.1
). Had the plaintiff not made clear to the defendant the importance that
he attached to not being troubled by aircraft noise, the defendant would not have been
liable on the ground that the loss suffered by the plaintiff would not have been within
the contemplation of both parties at the time of entry into the contract.
The third point relates to the scope of 
Ruxley
. The speeches in 
Farley
 
contain three
different explanations for Mr Forsyth’s entitlement to recover £2,500. Lords Steyn (at
[21]) and Hutton (at [49]) classified the contract in 
Ruxley
 
as one for the provision of a
pleasurable amenity, thus the damages reflected Mr Forsyth’s disappointment at the
loss of this amenity. By contrast, Lord Clyde, while he made reference to the fact that the
contract was one for the provision of a pleasurable amenity, analysed 
Ruxley
 
in the
section of his speech devoted to the award of damages for inconvenience ([35]).
However, Lord Lloyd in his speech in 
Ruxley
 
records that the trial judge awarded Mr
Forsyth damages of £750 for ‘general inconvenience and disturbance’ separately from
the award of £2,500 in respect of his ‘loss of amenity’. It therefore seems at best
doubtful whether the award of £2,500 in 
Ruxley
 
can also be regarded as compensation
for inconvenience. The third and most radical analysis of 
Ruxley
 
was adopted by Lord
Scott (at [79]).
The fourth point relates to Lord Scott’s division of the cases into two distinct groups (see
[86]). The first group, represented by 
Ruxley
, consists of cases where the claim is one to
recover the value of the promised performance which has not been supplied by the party
in breach. The second group, represented by 
Watts
 
v. 
Morrow
, consists of claims to
recover consequential loss. In theory, the distinction has merit. But in practice it is likely
to be difficult to distinguish between the two categories. A case that illustrates the
difficulty is 
Hobbs
 
v. 
London and South Western Rly Co
 
(1875) LR 10 QB 111 (discussed
by Lord Scott at [88]). Does this case fall within Lord Scott’s first category or his
second? Lord Scott himself put it in the first category on the basis that the damages were
awarded to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of the contractual benefit to which he
was entitled, namely carriage of him and his family to Hampton Court. On the other
hand, Lord Clyde (at [35]–[36]) clearly regarded it as a case where damages were
awarded to compensate the plaintiff for the inconvenience suffered (and, on this basis, it
would appear to fall within Lord Scott’s second category). The difficulty in
distinguishing between the two categories lies in part in the fact that damages are
assessed in a category one case in a manner which may resemble the approach taken in
a category two case. Thus Lord Scott classified 
Hobbs
 
as a category one case but, in
relation to the assessment of damages, stated (at [88]) that it was reasonable to value
the contractual benefit to which the plaintiff was entitled ‘by reference to the discomfort
to the family of the walk home’. This very much mirrors the approach that would be
taken in a category two case and so, in practice, tends to blur the distinction between the
two categories.
Nevertheless, Lord Scott’s analysis is useful in so far as it demonstrates that there is
more than one way of framing a claim for damages. One of the difficulties with 
Hobbs
lies in explaining the basis on which damages were recovered for the inconvenience
suffered by the members of the plaintiff’s family, given the general rule that a
contracting party cannot sue and recover damages in respect of a loss that has been
suffered by a third party (on which see 
25.3.2.3
). Thus if the claim was a category two
case, only the plaintiff should have been compensated for his inconvenience and
discomfort. On the other hand, if the claim is properly classified as a category one case
then it becomes possible to argue that the performance for which the plaintiff contracted
was the carriage of himself and his family to Hampton Court.
An alternative analysis (see E McKendrick and K Worthington, ‘Damages for Non-
Pecuniary Loss’ in N Cohen and E McKendrick (eds), 
Comparative Remedies for Breach
of Contract
 
(Hart, 2004), p. 274), which is similar to that adopted by Lord Scott, is to
distinguish those cases in which the claimant seeks damages in respect of the
defendant’s failure to confer on the claimant a promised non-pecuniary benefit from
those cases in which the claimant seeks damages to compensate her for the non-
pecuniary loss which she has suffered as a result of, or as a consequence of, the
defendant’s breach of contract. The first category consists of cases in which the
defendant, expressly or impliedly, promises to confer a non-pecuniary benefit on the
claimant or the effect of the breach was to deny the claimant the non-pecuniary benefit
which she would have obtained from performance in accordance with the terms of the
contract. This category encompasses the holiday cases (such as 
Jarvis
 
v. 
Swans Tours
Ltd
 
[1973] QB 233) but it can also extend to cases such as 
Ruxley
 
where the defendant
did not promise, either expressly or impliedly, to confer a non-pecuniary benefit on the
claimant, but the contractual specification broken, of no intrinsic financial value in
itself, was accorded ‘added value’ by the claimant. The second category consists of cases
in which the claimant has attempted to recover damages in respect of non-pecuniary
losses which she has suffered as a consequence of the defendant’s breach of contract.
These consequential non-pecuniary losses can be divided into different categories,
although the categories are not watertight. The types of consequential non-pecuniary
losses that have been recognized in the cases include physical injury, psychiatric injury
or illness, embarrassment and loss of reputation, (physical) inconvenience, and mental
distress or disappointment. The courts have been much more willing to allow damages
to be recovered in respect of physical injuries suffered as a result of a breach of contract
than they have been in the case where the claimant suffers mental distress or
disappointment. The latter appear to be recoverable only within the limits recognized by
the House of Lords in 
Farley
, although it is suggested that most of the cases in which
damages have been awarded for distress and loss of enjoyment are better seen within
the first category; that is to say they are cases in which the defendant expressly or
impliedly promised to provide the claimant with pleasure or relief from distress or the
claimant was deprived, as a result of the breach, of performance to which she attached
‘added value’.
The final point regarding 
Farley
 
relates to the assessment of damages. In this respect
Farley
 
resembles 
Ruxley
 
(see 
23.3.1
) in that all the reasoned speeches in the House of
Lords recognized that £10,000 was at the top end of the scale but they were not
prepared to deem 
it to be excessive on the facts of the case. Fears that this case will open
the floodgates seem misplaced. Rather, the effect of the decision is more likely to be to
bring the law formally into line with practice in the lower courts, particularly the county
courts, which, as Lord Steyn pointed out (at [20]), regularly award damages on a modest
scale for non-pecuniary losses in the ‘diverse contractual contexts’ to which he makes
reference. This practice has been legitimated by the House of Lords but the decision in
Farley
 
should not be seen as a green light for the increase in the level of damages
awarded. It is not. Damages should continue to be awarded on a modest scale. In order
to ensure a measure of consistency, the Court of Appeal has taken account of the level of
damages awarded in analogous claims, such as bereavement damages and the amounts
awarded for an affront to one’s feelings in cases of sex and race discrimination (
Milner
v. 
Carnival plc (t/a Cunard)
 
[2010] EWCA Civ 389, [2010] 3 All ER 701). When
assessing damages, it is important that judges ‘stand back’ and look at the different
elements in the round before arriving at the figure which provides the claimant with
appropriate compensation. It is also important to ensure that there is no element of
double counting.
23.7
 
The Date of Assessment
The general rule is that damages are to be assessed as at the date of the breach of
contract (
Johnson
 
v. 
Agnew
 
[1980] AC 367). The reason for this is that the innocent
party is presumed to be able to go out into the market at the date of breach and obtain
substitute performance, and the cost of that substitute performance will fix the measure
of damages to which it is entitled. The rule is based on the assumption that there is an
immediately available market for the subject matter of the contract. Where this is not
the case (for example, a contract for the sale of land where, on the default of the
purchaser, the vendor—taking all reasonable steps—cannot find an alternative
purchaser for the property) then the courts are more likely to defer the date of
assessment to a later point in time, such as the date on which a sale is achieved (
Hooper
v. 
Oates
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 91, [2013] 3 All ER 211). Thus the rule that damages are to be
assessed at the date of breach is not without its exceptions. As Lord Wilberforce
observed in 
Johnson
 
v. 
Agnew
 
(at p. 401), ‘if to follow [the rule] would give rise to
injustice, the court has power to fix such other date as may be appropriate in the
circumstances’. Thus, in the case where the claimant could not have been aware of the
breach at the time at which it occurred, damages will generally be assessed as at the date
on which the claimant could, with reasonable diligence, have discovered the existence of
the breach. Further, in 
Wroth
 
v. 
Tyler
 
[1974] Ch 30 the date of assessment was
postponed because the innocent party, who was the purchaser of property in a contract
which the defendant wrongfully repudiated, did not have the resources to enter into a
substitute transaction on a rapidly rising housing market.
The general rule and its exceptions were examined by the House of Lords in 
Golden
Strait Corporation
 
v. 
Nippon Yusen Kubishika Kaisha
 
[2007] UKHL 12, [2007] 2 AC
353. The parties entered into a charterparty on 10 July 1998; the duration was stated to
be seven years. On 14 December 2001 the charterers repudiated the contract. The
owners accepted the repudiation on 17 December 2001. The arbitrator held that the
earliest date for contractual redelivery of the vessel was 6 December 2005. Accordingly,
the claimants sought to recover damages for the period between 17 December 2001 and
6 December 2005. The defendants maintained that they could not recover damages
beyond 20 March 2003, when the Second Gulf War commenced. The reason for this was
that clause 33 of the contract 
gave a right to cancel the contract in the event of the
outbreak of war or hostilities and the outbreak of the Second Gulf War was such an
event. The defendants maintained that they could not be liable in damages post 20
March 2003 when they would have terminated the contract pursuant to clause 33. A
majority of the House of Lords held that the defendants’ submission was correct and
that the claimants were not entitled to recover damages after that date given that clause
33 would not have required any performance by the charterers after that date.
The majority affirmed that the principle that damages should be assessed as at the date
of the breach of contract is not an inflexible rule. The underlying principle was held to be
that the aim of an award of damages is to put the claimant in the financial position
which it would have been in had the contract been performed according to its terms;
that is to say, the claimant is entitled to recover damages representing the value of the
contractual benefit of which it has been deprived (a similar principle was applied by the
Supreme Court in 
Bunge SA
 
v. 
Nidera BV
 
[2015] UKSC 43, [2015] 3 All ER 1082). While
this aim will be met in most cases by assessing damages as at the date of breach, it will
not be achieved in all cases. In these exceptional cases damages need not be assessed as
at the date of breach. The present case was held, by a majority of their Lordships, to be
such an exceptional case. The essence of the reasoning of the majority is to be found in
the following passage from the speech of Lord Scott (at [38]):
The arguments of the Owners [that they were entitled to recover damages beyond 20 March 2003] offend the
compensatory principle. They are seeking compensation exceeding the value of the contractual benefits of
which they were deprived. Their case requires the assessor to speculate about what might happen over the
period 17 December 2001 to 6 December 2005 regarding the occurrence of a clause 33 event and to shut his
eyes to the actual happening of a clause 33 event in March 2003. The argued justification for thus offending the
compensatory principle is that priority should be given to the so-called principle of certainty. My Lords there is,
in my opinion, no such principle. Certainty is a desideratum and a very important one, particularly in
commercial contracts. But it is not a principle and must give way to principle. Otherwise incoherence of
principle is the likely result. The achievement of certainty in relation to commercial contracts depends, I would
suggest, on firm and settled principles of the law of contract rather than on the tailoring of principle in order to
frustrate tactics of delay to which many litigants in many areas of litigation are wont to resort. Be that as it may,
the compensatory principle that must underlie awards of contractual damages is, in my opinion, clear and
requires the appeal in the case to be dismissed.
But the arguments are not all one way. Lord Bingham and Lord Walker dissented on the
ground that the decision puts at risk the values of certainty and finality in commercial
contract law. In particular, the decision of the majority gives a potential incentive to
delay the settlement process so that account can be taken of subsequent events. As Lord
Bingham pointed out (at [22]) in his dissenting speech, the owners would have not been
able to point to the certainty of the outbreak of war in 2003 if they had ‘promptly
honoured their secondary obligation to pay damages’ at the end of 2001. While Lord
Carswell was of the view (at [67]) that the courts have the ability to prevent such
delaying tactics by contract-breakers if an application is made to the court ‘to proceed
with dispatch’, others are less confident in the ability of the courts to prevent such abuse
(on which see further Lord Mustill, ‘
The Golden Victory—
Some Reflections’ (2008) 124
LQR
 
569).
23.8
 
Limiting the Protection of the
Performance Interest
A claimant cannot in all circumstances claim the full protection of his performance
interest. The law places various limits upon his ability to do so. These limits are
sometimes inherent in the ordinary rules of proof. For example, a claimant must prove
that the defendant has breached the terms of the contract and that the breach has
caused him the loss in respect of which he brings his claim for damages. In some cases it
can be a difficult task for a claimant to show that the breach has caused that loss (see,
for example, 
Chaplin
 
v. 
Hicks
 
[1911] 2 KB 786, 
23.4
, and 
Monarch Steamship Co Ltd
 
v.
Karlshamns Oljefabriker (A/B)
 
[1949] AC 196). In this section three doctrines will be
examined. Each doctrine demonstrates that the law is not committed to the full
protection of the claimant’s performance interest (albeit that the reasons for limiting the
extent of the claim differ in each category).
23.8.1
 
Remoteness
A claimant cannot recover damages in respect of a loss which is too remote a
consequence of the defendant’s breach of contract. As has been pointed out (
13.1
),
claims for consequential losses are extremely significant in practice, largely because of
their size. The remoteness rules are therefore extremely important because, the greater
the extent of the liability that is imposed at common law, the greater the steps that may
have to be taken to draft clauses, such as exclusion and limitation clauses, which aim to
keep liability within acceptable bounds.
It is in fact no easy task to discern the point at which the courts draw the line between
losses that are too remote and hence irrecoverable and losses that are recoverable. The
difference between a loss that is too remote and one that is not appears to be one of
degree, and not kind. The leading case is 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
(1854) 9 Exch 341. The
rule there laid down was that the losses are recoverable if they flow naturally from the
breach or if they are in the contemplation of both parties at the time of entry into the
contract. In the twentieth century the principal issue of controversy was the relationship
between the decisions of the Court of Appeal in 
Victoria Laundry (Windsor)
 
v. 
Newman
Industries
 
[1949] 2 KB 528 and 
Parsons (Livestock) Ltd
 
v. 
Uttley Ingham & Co Ltd
[1978] QB 791. The tension between these two cases remains largely unresolved. But
certain things are clear. First, the nature of the breach is irrelevant; that is to say the
courts do not distinguish between intentional, careless and inadvertent breaches of
contract (although in tort the law does distinguish in this respect between intentional
and unintentional torts). Secondly, the recoverability of damages does not depend upon
the nature of the loss suffered, although Lord Denning sought to draw such a distinction
in 
Parsons
. Rather, the recoverability of damages depends upon the knowledge or the
contemplation of the parties at the time of entry into the contract and, in particular, the
knowledge of the party in breach. In the twenty-first century the major development has
been the decision of the House of Lords in 
Transfield Shipping Inc
 
v. 
Mercator
Shipping Inc (The Achilleas)
 
[2008] UKHL 48, [2009] 1 AC 61, in which Lord
Hoffmann sought to re-state the approach which the courts should take in cases in
which it is alleged that the loss suffered is too remote a consequence of the breach of
contract.
HADLEY V. BAXENDALE
(1854) 9 Exch 341, Court of Exchequer
The plaintiff, a mill owner, entered into a contract with the defendant, a carrier,
under which the defendant agreed to carry a broken crank shaft from the plaintiff’s
mill to a third party engineer for repair and then to deliver the crank shaft back to
the plaintiff once the repairs had been completed. In breach of contract, the
defendant delayed in the delivery of the crank shaft to the third party engineer and
this resulted in a complete loss of production at the mill for five extra days. The
plaintiff claimed damages for the loss of profit for the five days that the mill was
shut down as a consequence of the defendant’s breach but it was held that the
loss of profits was too remote a consequence of the breach and was therefore not
recoverable.
Alderson B
Now we think the proper rule in such a case as the present is this:—Where two
parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which
the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be
such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e.
according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such
as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties,
at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it. Now,
if the special circumstances under which the contract was actually made were
communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants, and thus known to both parties,
the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract, which they would
reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily
follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances so known and
communicated. But, on the other hand, if these special circumstances were wholly
unknown to the party breaking the contract, he, at the most, could only be
supposed to have had in his contemplation the amount of injury which would arise
generally, and in the great multitude of cases not affected by any special
circumstances, from such a breach of contract. For, had the special circumstances
been known, the parties might have specially provided for the breach of contract
by special terms as to the damages in that case; and of this advantage it would be
very unjust to deprive them. Now the above principles are those by which we think
the jury ought to be guided in estimating the damages arising out of any breach of
contract. It is said, that other cases such as breaches of contract in the non-
payment of money, or in the not making a good title to land, are to be treated as
exceptions from this, and as governed by a conventional rule. But as, in such
cases, both parties must be supposed to be cognisant of that well-known rule,
these cases may, we think, be more properly classed under the rule above
enunciated as to cases under known special circumstances, because there both
parties may reasonably be presumed to contemplate the estimation of the amount
of damages according to the conventional rule. Now, in the present case, if we are
to apply the principles above laid down, we find that the only circumstances here
communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants at the time the contract was
made, were, that the article to be carried was the broken shaft of a mill, and that
the plaintiffs were the millers of that mill. But how do these circumstances shew
reasonably that the profits of the mill must be stopped by an unreasonable delay in
the delivery of the broken shaft by the carrier to the third person? Suppose the
plaintiffs had another shaft in their possession put up or putting up at the time, and
that they only wished to send back the broken shaft to the engineer who 
made it; it
is clear that this would be quite consistent with the above circumstances, and yet
the unreasonable delay in the delivery would have no effect upon the intermediate
profits of the mill. Or, again, suppose that, at the time of the delivery to the carrier,
the machinery of the mill had been in other respects defective, then, also, the
same results would follow. Here it is true that the shaft was actually sent back to
serve as a model for a new one, and that the want of a new one was the only
cause of the stoppage of the mill, and that the loss of profits really arose from not
sending down the new shaft in proper time, and that this arose from the delay in
delivering the broken one to serve as a model. But it is obvious that, in the great
multitude of cases of millers sending off broken shafts to third persons by a carrier
under ordinary circumstances, such consequences would not, in all probability,
have occurred; and these special circumstances were here never communicated
by the plaintiffs to the defendants. It follows, therefore, that the loss of profits here
cannot reasonably be considered such a consequence of the breach of contract as
could have been fairly and reasonably contemplated by both the parties when they
made this contract. For such loss would neither have flowed naturally from the
breach of this contract in the great multitude of such cases occurring under
ordinary circumstances, nor were the special circumstances, which, perhaps,
would have made it a reasonable and natural consequence of such breach of
contract, communicated to or known by the defendants. The Judge ought,
therefore, to have told the jury, that, upon the facts then before them, they ought
not to take the loss of profits into consideration at all in estimating the damages.
There must therefore be a new trial in this case.
Rule absolute.
Commentary
Hadley
 
was decided at a critical point in the development of English contract law. It was
decided at a time when the judges were assuming a greater role in the formulation of
legal principle and, in consequence, the role of the jury was diminishing. The judgment
thus aims to lay down principles to be applied by the jury when assessing the damages
payable upon a breach of contract.
The rule laid down in 
Hadley
 
is sometimes required to do work for which it was not
intended. In some cases it is cited as authority for the basic measure of recovery (see, for
example, 
Bence Graphics International Ltd
 
v. 
Fasson UK Ltd
 
[1998] QB 87, 102) when
in fact the function of the rule laid down in the case is to 
limit
 
the liability of the party in
breach. It does so by stating that the innocent party cannot be put in the position which
he would have been in had the contract been performed according to its terms if the
losses sought to be recovered do not flow naturally from the breach or were not within
the reasonable contemplation of both parties at the time of entry into the contract. The
rules relating to the interpretation of a clause which purports to exclude liability for
‘indirect or consequential loss’ have also become intertwined with 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
(see 
13.2.4
). The reason for this is that the courts have held that the effect of such a
clause is to exclude liability for losses falling within the second limb of 
Hadley
 
(that is to
say, losses that are within the contemplation of both parties at the time of entry into the
contract) but not losses that fall within the first (losses that flow naturally from the
breach). The use of 
Hadley
 
in this latter context seems doubly unfortunate. First, it is
unlikely that the court in 
Hadley
 
intended such a result and it also seems unlikely that
parties to a contract containing such an exclusion clause intended to produce 
this result.
Secondly, it is a matter of some doubt whether there are two rules in 
Hadley
 
or only one
and it seems unfortunate that the courts in the context of the interpretation of an
exclusion clause insist that there are two rules when in the remoteness cases, the drift of
judicial opinion appears to be in the direction of there being only one test (see, for
example, the judgment of Asquith LJ in 
Victoria Laundry (Windsor)
 
v. 
Newman
Industries
 
[1949] 2 KB 528, later in this section).
Why was the loss not recoverable on the facts of the case? First, the loss did not flow
naturally from the breach; the mill owner might have had a spare mill shaft. Secondly, it
was not within the contemplation of both parties at the time of entry into the contract
because the defendants did not have knowledge of the loss likely to be suffered by the
plaintiffs. Three points should be noted here. First, it is important to note that the
relevant time is the time of entry into the contract and not the time of breach. What the
courts are doing is to examine the contractual allocation of risk. A defendant who knows
at the time of entry into the contract that he is potentially exposed to a claim for
substantial damages will either insert a clause into the contract in order to exclude or
limit that liability or he will increase the price in order to reflect the increased risk he
must bear. What the law does not allow a claimant to do is to say nothing about the
extent of any special loss he is likely to suffer as a result of the breach, and so avoid the
possibility of being asked to pay more in return for the defendant agreeing to accept
responsibility for that loss, and then seek to recover in respect of that loss. In this sense,
the remoteness rules encourage parties to disclose special losses likely to be suffered as a
result of the breach. The price of failing to do so is that the innocent party may be unable
to recover in respect of that loss.
The second point relates to the knowledge of the defendants on the facts of 
Hadley
. This
proved to be an issue of some controversy on the facts of the case itself. The headnote to
the case states that the defendant’s clerk was told, prior to the conclusion of the
contract, that the mill was stopped and that the shaft must be delivered immediately.
The Court of Appeal in 
Victoria Laundry (Windsor)
 
v. 
Newman Industries
 
[1949] 2 KB
528 (later in this section) concluded that the headnote was, in this respect, misleading
on the basis that the court must have rejected the evidence adduced on behalf of the
plaintiffs on this issue because Alderson B concluded (in 
Hadley
) that:
we find that the only circumstances here communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants at the time the
contract was made, were, that the article to be carried was the broken shaft of a mill, and that the plaintiffs were
the millers of that mill.
Thus 
Hadley
 
is a case in which the defendants did not have knowledge of the fact that
the mill would be shut until the crankshaft had been repaired and returned to the mill.
This leads us to the third point which relates to the matters that the plaintiffs in 
Hadley
would have had to prove in order to hold the defendants liable for the losses which they
suffered. There are two possible approaches. One view is that it would suffice for the
plaintiffs to prove that the defendants had knowledge of the fact that the mill was shut.
A second view is that knowledge is not enough of itself and that it must be demonstrated
that the defendant has, in some way, accepted that he would bear responsibility for the
loss should it eventuate. In 
British Columbia Saw Mill Co
 
v. 
Nettleship
 
(1868) LR 3 CP
499 Willes J stated that the knowledge must be brought home to the defendant under
such circumstances that he knows that the person with whom he contracts reasonably
believes that he accepts responsibility for the special loss (to similar effect see 
Horne
 
v.
Midland Railway Co
 
(1873) LR 8 CP 131 
where there are suggestions that the notice
must amount to an agreement to accept liability before the loss can be recovered). On
the other hand, a more liberal approach was adopted by the court in 
Simpson
 
v. 
London
and North Western Railway Co
 
(1876) 1 QBD 274, where the stipulation that samples
‘must be at Newcastle on Monday certain’ was held to be sufficient to impose a liability
on the defendant for the loss of profit suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the
defendant’s failure to deliver the goods to the showground in time for an agricultural
show. This is a matter to which we shall return after consideration of the decision of the
House of Lords in 
Transfield Shipping
 
(later in this section).
VICTORIA LAUNDRY (WINDSOR) V. NEWMAN
INDUSTRIES
[1949] 2 KB 528, Court of Appeal
The plaintiffs entered into a contract with the defendants under which they agreed
to buy from the defendants a large boiler for use in their business as launderers
and dyers. At the time at which the contract was concluded the boiler was installed
on the defendants’ premises. It was therefore necessary to dismantle the boiler
before it could be delivered to the plaintiffs. The boiler was badly damaged while it
was being dismantled and the consequence was that there was a delay of some
five months in delivering it to the plaintiffs. The defendants knew that the plaintiffs
were launderers and dyers and that they wanted the boiler for use in their
business. During the negotiations the plaintiffs expressed their intention to put the
boiler ‘into use in the shortest possible space of time’. The plaintiffs brought an
action for damages for the losses they had suffered as a result of the defendants’
breach of contract.
The trial judge, Streatfeild J, gave judgment for the plaintiffs for damages of
£110 under certain minor heads, but held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to
recover damages in respect of their loss of profit during the period of delay. He
concluded that the boiler was not a whole plant capable of being used by itself as a
profit-making machine, that the case fell within the second limb of the rule laid
down in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
, and that the defendants were not liable for the
plaintiffs’ loss of profit because the special object for which the plaintiffs were
acquiring the boiler had not been drawn to the defendants’ attention. The plaintiffs
appealed to the Court of Appeal who allowed the appeal and held that the plaintiffs
were entitled to recover damages for their general loss of profits but not for the loss
of profits which they suffered on the lucrative contracts that they had concluded
with the Ministry of Supply.
Asquith LJ
[delivering the judgment of the court]
(1)
(2)
(3)
The authorities on recovery of loss of profits as a head of damage are not easy
to reconcile. At one end of the scale stand cases where there has been non-
delivery or delayed delivery of what is on the face of it obviously a profit-earning
chattel; for instance, a merchant or passenger ship. … In such cases loss of profit
has rarely been refused. A second and intermediate class of case in which loss of
profit has often been awarded is where ordinary mercantile goods have been sold
to a merchant with knowledge by the vendor that the purchaser wanted them for
resale; at all events, where there was no market in which the purchaser could buy
similar goods against the contract on the seller’s default … At the other end of the
scale are cases where the defendant is not a vendor of the goods, but a carrier,
see, for instance, 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
9 Exch 341. … In such cases the courts
have been slow to 
allow loss of profit as an item of damage. This was not, it would
seem, because a different principle applies in such cases, but because the
application of the same principle leads to different results. A carrier commonly
knows less than a seller about the purposes for which the buyer or consignee
needs the goods, or about other ‘special circumstances’ which may cause
exceptional loss if due delivery is withheld.
Three of the authorities call for more detailed examination.
[He examined 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale, British Columbia Sawmills
 
v. 
Nettleship
 
LR
3 CP 409, and 
Cory
 
v. 
Thames Ironworks Company
 
LR 3 QB 181 and continued]
What propositions applicable to the present case emerge from the authorities
as a whole, including those analysed above? We think they include the following:—
It is well settled that the governing purpose of damages is to put the party
whose rights have been violated in the same position, so far as money can
do so, as if his rights had been observed: (
Sally Wertheim
 
v. 
Chicoutimi
Pulp Company
 
[1911] AC 301). This purpose, if relentlessly pursued, would
provide him with a complete indemnity for all loss de facto resulting from a
particular breach, however improbable, however unpredictable. This, in
contract at least, is recognized as too harsh a rule. Hence,
In cases of breach of contract the aggrieved party is only entitled to recover
such part of the loss actually resulting as was at the time of the contract
reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach.
What was at that time reasonably so foreseeable depends on the
(4)
(5)
(6)
knowledge then possessed by the parties or, at all events, by the party who
later commits the breach.
For this purpose, knowledge ‘possessed’ is of two kinds; one imputed, the
other actual. Everyone, as a reasonable person, is taken to know the
‘ordinary course of things’ and consequently what loss is liable to result
from a breach of contract in that ordinary course. This is the subject matter
of the ‘first rule’ in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
9 Exch 341. But to this knowledge,
which a contract-breaker is assumed to possess whether he actually
possesses it or not, there may have to be added in a particular case
knowledge which he actually possesses, of special circumstances outside
the ‘ordinary course of things’, of such a kind that a breach in those special
circumstances would be liable to cause more loss. Such a case attracts the
operation of the ‘second rule’ so as to make additional loss also
recoverable.
In order to make the contract-breaker liable under either rule it is not
necessary that he should actually have asked himself what loss is liable to
result from a breach. As has often been pointed out, parties at the time of
contracting contemplate not the breach of the contract, but its performance.
It suffices that, if he had considered the question, he would as a reasonable
man have concluded that the loss in question was liable to result (see
certain observations of Lord du Parcq in the recent case of 
A/B Karlshamns
Oljefabriker
 
v. 
Monarch Steamship Company Limited
 
[1949] AC 196).
Nor, finally, to make a particular loss recoverable, need it be proved that
upon a given state of knowledge the defendant could, as a reasonable
man, foresee that a breach must necessarily result in that loss. It is enough
if he could foresee it was likely so to result. It is indeed enough, to borrow
from the language of Lord du Parcq in the same case, at page 158, if the
loss (or some factor without which it would not have occurred) is a ‘serious
possibility’ or a ‘real danger’. For short, we have used the word ‘liable’ to
result. Possibly the colloquialism ‘on the cards’ indicates the shade of
meaning with some approach to accuracy.
[He set out the facts of the case and continued]
Since we are differing from a carefully reasoned judgment, we think it due to
the learned judge to indicate the grounds of our dissent.
[He set out the reasoning of the trial judge and continued]
First, … the learned judge appears to infer that because certain ‘special
circumstances’ were, in his view, not ‘drawn to the notice of’ the defendants and
therefore, in his view, the operation of the ‘second rule’ was excluded, ergo nothing
in respect of loss of business can be recovered under the ‘first rule.’ This inference
is, in our view, no more justified in the present case than it was in the case of 
Cory
v. 
Thames Ironworks Company
 
(1868) LR 3 QB 181. Secondly, that while it is not
wholly clear what were the ‘special circumstances’ on the non-communication of
which the learned judge relied, it would seem that they were, or included, the
following:—(a) the ‘circumstance’ that delay in delivering the boiler was going to
lead ‘necessarily’ to loss of profits. But the true criterion is surely not what was
bound ‘necessarily’ to result, but what was likely or liable to do so, and we think
that it was amply conveyed to the defendants by what was communicated to them
(plus what was patent without express communication) that delay in delivery was
likely to lead to ‘loss of business’; (b) the ‘circumstance’ that the plaintiffs needed
the boiler ‘to extend their business’. It was surely not necessary for the defendants
to be specifically informed of this, as a precondition of being liable for loss of
business. Reasonable persons in the shoes of the defendants must be taken to
foresee without any express intimation, that a laundry which, at a time when there
was a famine of laundry facilities, was paying 2,000l. odd for plant and intended at
such a time to put such plant ‘into use’ immediately, would be likely to suffer in
pocket from five months’ delay in delivery of the plant in question, whether they
intended by means of it to extend their business, or merely to maintain it, or to
reduce a loss; (c) the ‘circumstance’ that the plaintiffs had the assured expectation
of special contracts, which they could only fulfil by securing punctual delivery of the
boiler. Here, no doubt, the learned judge had in mind the particularly lucrative
dyeing contracts to which the plaintiffs looked forward and which they mention in
… [their] statement of claim. We agree that in order that the plaintiffs should
recover specifically and as such the profits expected on these contracts, the
defendants would have had to know, at the time of their agreement with the
plaintiffs, of the prospect and terms of such contracts. We also agree that they did
not in fact know these things. It does not, however, follow that the plaintiffs are
precluded from recovering some general (and perhaps conjectural) sum for loss of
business in respect of dyeing contracts to be reasonably expected, any more than
in respect of laundering contracts to be reasonably expected.
Thirdly, the other point on which Streatfield J largely based his judgment was
that there is a critical difference between the measure of damages applicable when
the defendant defaults in supplying a self-contained profit-earning whole and when
he defaults in supplying a part of that whole. In our view, there is no intrinsic magic,
in this connection, in the whole as against a part. The fact that a part only is
involved is only significant in so far as it bears on the capacity of the supplier to
foresee the consequences of non-delivery. If it is clear from the nature of the part
(or the supplier of it is informed) that its non-delivery will have the same effect as
non-delivery of the whole, his liability will be the same as if he had defaulted in
delivering the whole … [On the facts of the present case] there was no question of
a total stoppage resulting from non-delivery, yet there was ample means of
knowledge on the part of the defendants that business loss of some sort would be
likely to result to the plaintiffs from the defendants’ default in performing their
contract.
Commentary
This is another case in which the plaintiffs’ claim did not succeed (at least in respect of
the claim to recover the loss of profit on the contracts with the Ministry of Supply). The
defendants did not have knowledge of these lucrative contracts and so were not liable
for the exceptional loss of profits suffered by the plaintiffs. The distinction between
ordinary losses of profit and exceptional losses of profit is a difficult one. It is a
distinction of degree rather than kind and elsewhere in the law the extent of the loss
need not be foreseeable provided that the kind of loss is foreseeable. We shall return to
this issue after a brief detour in order to consider the rather difficult decision of the
House of Lords in:
KOUFOS V. C CZARNIKOW LTD (THE HERON II)
[1969] 1 AC 350, House of Lords
The plaintiff chartered the defendant’s vessel to carry 3,000 tons of sugar to
Basrah. In breach of contract, the vessel arrived at its destination nine days late.
The plaintiff intended to sell the sugar at Basrah. However, by the time the vessel
arrived the market for sugar had fallen from £32 10s per ton to £31 2s 9d per ton.
The plaintiff sued the defendant for breach of contract, claiming the difference in
price as damages. At trial, it was found that, although the defendant 
did not
 
know
what the plaintiff intended to do with the sugar, the defendant 
did
 
know that there
was a market for sugar in Basrah. However, the judge found that it was impossible
to say that it was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant that delay in delivery
would result in that kind of loss. The Court of Appeal reversed this decision, and
held that loss due to the fall in market prices was not too remote. The House of
Lords unanimously affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal.
Lord Reid
It is generally sufficient that that event would have appeared to the defendant as
not unlikely to occur. It is hardly ever possible in this matter to assess probabilities
with any degree of mathematical accuracy. But I do not find … any warrant for
regarding as within the contemplation of the parties any event which would not
have appeared to the defendant, had he thought about it, to have a very
substantial degree of probability.
But then it has been said that the liability of defendants has been further
extended by 
Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd.
 
v. 
Newman Industries Ltd
. I do not
think so.
[He set out the facts of the case and considered the six propositions of law to
be found in the judgment of Asquith LJ (earlier in this section) and continued]
But what is said to create a ‘landmark’ is the statement of principles by Asquith
LJ. This does to some extent go beyond the older authorities and in so far as it
does so, I do not agree with it. In paragraph (2) it is said that the plaintiff is entitled
to recover ‘such part of the loss actually resulting as was at the time of the contract
reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach.’ To bring in reasonable
foreseeability appears to me to be confusing measure of damages in contract with
measure of damages in tort. A great many extremely unlikely results are
reasonably foreseeable: it is true that Lord Asquith may have meant foreseeable
as a likely result, and if that is all he meant I would not object further than to say
that I think that the phrase is liable to be misunderstood. For the same reason I
would take 
exception to the phrase ‘liable to result’ in paragraph (5). Liable is a
very vague word but I think that one would usually say that when a person
foresees a very improbable result he foresees that it is liable to happen.
I agree with the first half of paragraph (6). For the best part of a century it has
not been required that the defendant could have foreseen that a breach of contract
must necessarily result in the loss which has occurred. But I cannot agree with the
second half of that paragraph. It has never been held to be sufficient in contract
that the loss was foreseeable as ‘a serious possibility’ or ‘a real danger’ or as being
‘on the cards.’ It is on the cards that one can win £100,000 or more for a stake of a
few pence—several people have done that. And anyone who backs a hundred to
one chance regards a win as a serious possibility—many people have won on
such a chance. … It appears to me that in the ordinary use of language there is
wide gulf between saying that some event is not unlikely or quite likely to happen
and saying merely that it is a serious possibility, a real danger, or on the cards.
Suppose one takes a well-shuffled pack of cards, it is quite likely or not unlikely
that the top card will prove to be a diamond: the odds are only 3 to 1 against. But
most people would not say that it is quite likely to be the nine of diamonds for the
odds are then 51 to 1 against. On the other hand I think that most people would
say that there is a serious possibility or a real danger of its being turned up first
and of course it is on the cards. If the tests of ‘real danger’ or ‘serious possibility’
are in future to be authoritative then the 
Victoria Laundry
 
case would indeed be a
landmark because it would mean that 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
would be differently
decided today. I certainly could not understand any court deciding that, on the
information available to the carrier in that case, the stoppage of the mill was neither
a serious possibility nor a real danger. If those tests are to prevail in future then let
us cease to pay lip service to the rule in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
. But in my judgment
to adopt these tests would extend liability for breach of contract beyond what is
reasonable or desirable. From the limited knowledge which I have of commercial
affairs I would not expect such an extension to be welcomed by the business
community and from the legal point of view I can find little or nothing to recommend
it …
It appears to me that, without relying in any way on the 
Victoria Laundry
 
case,
and taking the principle that had already been established, the loss of profit
claimed in this case was not too remote to be recoverable as damages.
Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest
I think it is clear that the loss need not be such that the contract-breaker could see
that it was certain to result. The question that arises concerns the measure of
prevision which should fairly and reasonably be ascribed to him.
My Lords, in applying the guidance given in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
I would hope
that no undue emphasis would be placed upon any one word or phrase … The
result in any particular case need not depend upon giving pride of place to any one
of such phrases as ‘liable to result’ or ‘not unlikely to result.’ Each one of these
phrases may be of help but so may many others …
My Lords, the words, phrases and passages to which I have referred are useful
and helpful indications of the application of the rule in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
. But
they neither add to the rule nor do they modify it. I regard the illuminating judgment
of the Court of Appeal in 
Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd.
 
v. 
Newman Industries Ltd.
as a most valuable analysis of the rule. It was there pointed out that in order to
make a contract-breaker liable under what was called ‘either rule’ in 
Hadley
 
v.
Baxendale
 
it is not necessary that he should actually have asked himself what loss
is liable to result from a breach but that it suffices that if he had considered the
question he would as a reasonable man have concluded that the loss in question
was liable to result. Nor need it be proved, in order to recover a particular loss, that
upon a given state 
of knowledge he could, as a reasonable man, foresee that a
breach must necessarily result in that loss. Certain illustrative phrases are
employed in that case. They are valuable by way of exposition but for my part I
doubt whether the phrase ‘on the cards’ has a sufficiently clear meaning or
possesses such a comparable shade of meaning as to qualify it to take its place
with the various other phrases which line up as expositions of the rule.
If the problem in the present case is that of relating accepted principle to the
facts which have been found, I entertain no doubt that if at the time of their contract
the parties had considered what the consequence would be if the arrival of the ship
at Basrah was delayed they would have contemplated that some loss to the
respondents was likely or was liable to result. The appellant at the time that he
made his contract must have known that if in breach of contract his ship did not
arrive at Basrah when it ought to arrive he would be liable to pay damages. He
would not know that a loss to the respondents was certain or inevitable but he
must, as a reasonable business man, have contemplated that the respondents
would very likely suffer loss, and that it would be or would be likely to be a loss
referable to market price fluctuations at Basrah. I cannot think that he should
escape liability by saying that he would only be aware of a possibility of loss but
not of a probability or certainty of it. He might have used any one of many phrases.
He might have said that a loss would be likely; or that a loss would not be unlikely;
or that a loss was liable to result; or that the risk that delay would cause loss to the
respondents was a serious possibility; or that there would be a real danger of a
loss; or that the risk of his being liable to have to pay for the loss was one that he
ought commercially to take into account. As a practical business man he would not
have paused to reflect on the possible nuances of meaning of any one of these
phrases. Nor would he have sent for a dictionary … Lord Hodson
A close study of the [remoteness] rule was made by the Court of Appeal in the
case of the 
Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd
 
v. 
Newman Industries Ltd.
 
The
judgment of the court … was delivered by Asquith LJ, who referred to the 
Monarch
Steamship
 
case [1949] AC 196 and suggested the phrase ‘liable to result’ as
appropriate to describe the degree of probability required. This may be a
colourless expression but I do not find it possible to improve on it. If the word
‘likelihood’ is used it may convey the impression that the chances are all in favour
of the thing happening, an idea which I would reject.
Lord Pearce
[T]he case of 
Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd
 
v. 
Newman Industries Ltd
 
…
represented (in felicitous language) the approximate view of 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
taken by many judges in trying ordinary cases of breach of contract.
It is argued that it was an erroneous departure from 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
in that
it allowed damages where the loss was ‘a serious possibility’ or ‘a real danger’
instead of maintaining that the loss must be ‘probable,’ in the sense that it was
more likely to result than not … in my opinion the expressions used in the 
Victoria
Laundry
 
case were right. I do not however accept the colloquialism ‘on the cards’
as being a useful test because I am not sure just what nuance it has either in my
own personal vocabulary or in that of others.
Lord Upjohn
Asquith LJ in 
Victoria Laundry
 
used the words ‘likely to result’ and he treated that
as synonymous with a serious possibility or a real danger. He went on to equate
that with the expression ‘on the cards’ but like all your Lordships I deprecate the
use of that phrase which is far too imprecise and to my mind is capable of denoting
a most improbable and unlikely event, such as winning a prize on a premium bond
on any given drawing …
It is clear that on the one hand the test of foreseeability as laid down in the
case of tort is not the test for breach of contract; nor on the other hand must the
loser establish that the loss was a near certainty or an odds-on probability. I am
content to adopt as the test a ‘real danger’ or a ‘serious possibility.’ There may be a
shade of difference between these two phrases but the assessment of damages is
not an exact science and what to one judge or jury will appear a real danger may
appear to another judge or jury to be a serious possibility.
Commentary
The decision of the House of Lords has attracted some criticism, not so much in terms of
the result of the case but in relation to the length of the speeches and the variety of
phrases used to express the outcome. Writing extrajudicially (‘
The Achilleas
: Custom
and Practice or Foreseeability?’ [2010] 
Edinburgh Law Review
 
47, 51) Lord Hoffmann
stated that ‘the 
Heron II
 
contains a thesaurus of expressions which can be used to
describe the necessary degree of probability’. The reasoning of their Lordships has been
summarized as follows (H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell,
2021), para 29–135, footnotes omitted):
What was in the contemplation of reasonable men obviously depends on the relevant degree of likelihood that a
particular kind of loss may occur, and this issue was extensively discussed in 
The Heron II
. Lord Reid used ‘the
words “not unlikely” as denoting a degree of probability considerably less than an even chance but nevertheless
not very unusual and easily foreseeable.’ Although Lord Morris thought it unnecessary to choose any one phrase
he used ‘not unlikely to occur’, with ‘liable to result’ as an alternative; Lord Hodson accepted the latter phrase.
Both Lords Pearce and Upjohn adopted the words ‘a real danger’ or ‘a serious possibility’ which were the
phrases used in the House of Lords in 1991. (Four of their Lordships in 
The Heron II
 
agreed that the
colloquialism ‘on the cards’ should not be used.)
A more concise summary of the case has been offered by Professor Burrows in the
following terms (A Burrows, ‘Limitations on Compensation’ in A Burrows and E Peel
(eds), 
Commercial Remedies: Current Issues and Problems
 
(Oxford University Press,
2003), pp. 27, 33): ‘perhaps the clearest way of expressing the essence of their
Lordships’ reasoning is that, while a slight possibility of the loss occurring is required in
tort, a serious possibility of the loss occurring is required in contract.’ Not
unsurprisingly, the decision in 
Heron II
 
has not been the last word on the subject of
remoteness of damage. The next important case to consider the topic was the following
decision of the Court of Appeal:
PARSONS (LIVESTOCK) LTD V. UTTLEY INGHAM & CO
LTD
[1978] QB 791, Court of Appeal
The defendant company contracted to supply and install a large cylindrical metal
hopper on the plaintiffs’ pig farm, in which the plaintiffs intended to store pig feed.
When they erected the hopper the defendants failed to notice that the ventilator at
the top of the hopper was 
closed. The plaintiffs then filled the hopper with pignuts
and subsequently fed them to the pigs. As a result of the lack of ventilation the nuts
began to turn mouldy over a period of time. The plaintiffs continued to feed the
nuts to the pigs because mouldy nuts do not generally cause harm to pigs. Over
time the pigs began to show signs of illness and the plaintiffs eventually discovered
the lack of ventilation in the hopper. The plaintiffs alleged that a large number of
their pigs contracted E coli as a result of eating the mouldy nuts. They alleged that
254 pigs had died as a result of the outbreak, that they had incurred considerable
expense in combating it, and that they had suffered a substantial loss of profit.
The defendants denied that they were liable for the loss of profit suffered by the
plaintiffs on the basis that it was too remote a consequence of their breach of
contract. The Court of Appeal held that they were liable for the illness and death of
the pigs, albeit that the judges gave different reasons for allowing the claim.
Lord Denning MR
The law as to remoteness
Remoteness of damage is beyond doubt a question of law. In 
C Czarnikow Ltd
 
v.
Koufos
 
[1969] AC 350 the House of Lords said that, in remoteness of damage,
there is a difference between contract and tort. In the case of a 
breach of contract
,
the court has to consider whether the consequences were of such a kind that a
reasonable man, at the time of making the contract, would 
contemplate
 
them as
being of a very substantial degree of probability. (In the House of Lords various
expressions were used to describe this degree of probability, such as, not merely
‘on the cards’ because that may be too low: but as being ‘not unlikely to occur’ (see
pp. 383 and 388); or ‘likely to result or at least not unlikely to result’ (see p. 406); or
‘liable to result’ (see p. 410); or that there was a ‘real danger’ or ‘serious possibility’
of them occurring (see p. 415).)
In the case of a tort, the court has to consider whether the consequences were
of such a kind that a reasonable man, at the time of the tort committed, would
foresee them as being of a much lower degree of probability. (In the House of
Lords various expressions were used to describe this, such as, it is sufficient if the
consequences are ‘liable to happen in the most unusual case’ (see p. 385); or in a
‘very improbable’ case (see p. 389); or that ‘they may happen as a result of the
breach, however unlikely it may be, unless it can be brushed aside as far-fetched’
(see p. 422).)
I find it difficult to apply those principles universally to all cases of contract or to
all cases of tort: and to draw a distinction between what a man ‘contemplates’ and
what he ‘foresees’. I soon begin to get out of my depth. I cannot swim in this sea of
semantic exercises—to say nothing of the different degrees of probability—
especially when the cause of action can be laid either in contract or in tort. I am
swept under by the conflicting currents. I go back with relief to the distinction drawn
in legal theory by Professors Hart and Honoré in their book Causation in the Law
(1959), at pp. 281–287. They distinguish between those cases in contract in which
a man has suffered no damage to person or property, but only economic loss, such
as, loss of profit or loss of opportunities for gain in some future transaction: and
those in which he claims damages for an injury actually done to his person or
damage actually done to his property (including his livestock) or for ensuing
expense (
damnum emergens
) to which he has actually been put. In the law of tort,
there is emerging a distinction between economic loss and physical damage … It
seems to me that in the law of contract, too, a similar distinction is emerging. It is
between loss of profit consequent on a breach of contract and physical damage
consequent on it.
Loss of profit cases
I would suggest as a solution that in the former class of case—loss of profit cases
—the defaulting party is only liable for the consequences if they are such as, at the
time of the contract, he ought reasonably to have 
contemplated
 
as a 
serious
possibility or real danger. You must assume that, at the time of the contract, he had
the very kind of breach in mind—such a breach as afterwards happened, as for
instance, delay in transit—and then you must ask: ought he reasonably to have
contemplated
 
that there was a 
serious
 
possibility that such a breach would involve
the plaintiff in loss of profit? If yes, the contractor is liable for the loss unless he has
taken care to exempt himself from it by a condition in the contract—as, of course,
he is able to do if it was the sort of thing which he could reasonably contemplate.
The law on this class of case is now covered by the three leading cases of 
Hadley
v. 
Baxendale
, 9 Exch 341; 
Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd
 
v. 
Newman Industries
Ltd
 
[1949] 2 KB 528; and 
C Czarnikow Ltd
 
v. 
Koufos
 
[1969] 1 AC 350. These were
all ‘loss of profit’ cases: and the test of ‘reasonable contemplation’ and ‘serious
possibility’ should, I suggest, be kept to that type of loss or, at any rate, to
economic loss.
Physical damage cases
In the second class of case—the physical injury or expense case—the defaulting
party is liable for any loss or expense which he ought reasonably to have 
foreseen
at the time of the breach as a possible consequence, even if it was only a 
slight
possibility. You must assume that he was aware of his breach, and then you must
ask: ought he reasonably to have foreseen, at the time of the breach, that
something of this kind might happen in consequence of it? This is the test which
has been applied in cases of tort ever since 
The Wagon Mound
 
cases [1961] AC
388 and [1967] 1 AC 617. But there is a long line of cases which support a like test
in cases of contract.
One class of case which is particularly apposite here concerns latent defects in
goods: in modern words ‘product liability’. In many of these cases the manufacturer
is liable in contract to the immediate party for a breach of his duty to use
reasonable care and is liable in tort to the ultimate consumer for the same want of
reasonable care. The ultimate consumer can either sue the retailer in contract and
pass the liability up the chain to the manufacturer, or he can sue the manufacturer
in tort and thus by-pass the chain. The liability of the manufacturer ought to be the
same in either case. In nearly all these cases the defects were outside the range of
anything that was in fact contemplated, or could reasonably have been
contemplated, by the manufacturer or by anyone down the chain to the retailers.
Yet the manufacturer and others in the chain have been held liable for the damage
done to the ultimate user …
Instances could be multiplied of injuries to persons or damage to property
where the defendant is liable for his negligence to one man in contract and to
another in tort. Each suffers like damage. The test of remoteness is, and should
be, the same in both.
Coming to the present case, we were told that in some cases the makers of
these hoppers supply them direct to the pig farmer under contract with him, but in
other cases they supply them through an intermediate dealer—who buys from the
manufacturer and resells to the pig farmer on the self-same terms—in which the
manufacturer delivers direct to the pig farmer. In the one case the pig farmer can
sue the manufacturer in contract. In the other in tort. The test of remoteness should
be the same. It should be the test in tort.
Conclusion
The present case falls within the class of case where the breach of contract
causes physical damage. The test of remoteness in such cases is similar to that in
tort. The contractor is 
liable for all such loss or expense as could reasonably have
been foreseen, at the time of the breach, as a possible consequence of it. Applied
to this case, it means that the makers of the hopper are liable for the death of the
pigs. They ought reasonably to have foreseen that, if the mouldy pignuts were fed
to the pigs, there was a possibility that they might become ill. Not a serious
possibility. Nor a real danger. But still a slight possibility. On that basis the makers
were liable for the illness suffered by the pigs. They suffered from diarrhoea at the
beginning. This triggered off the deadly E. coli. That was a far worse illness than
could then be foreseen. But that does not lessen this liability. The type or kind of
damage was foreseeable even though the extent of it was not: see 
Hughes
 
v. 
Lord
Advocate
 
[1963] AC 837. The makers are liable for the loss of the pigs that died
and of the expenses of the vet and such like, but not for loss of profit on future
sales or future opportunities of gain: see 
Simon
 
v. 
Pawson and Leafs Ltd
 
(1932) 38
Com Cas 151.
So I reach the same result as the judge, but by a different route. I would
dismiss the appeal.
Orr LJ
I agree with Lord Denning MR and also with Scarman LJ, whose judgment I have
had the opportunity of reading, that this appeal should be dismissed, but with
respect to Lord Denning MR I would dismiss it for the reasons to be given by
Scarman LJ and not on the basis that a distinction is to be drawn for the present
purposes between loss of profits and physical damage cases. I have not been
satisfied that such a distinction is sufficiently supported by the authorities.
Scarman LJ
My conclusion in the present case is the same as that of Lord Denning MR but I
reach it by a different route. I would dismiss the appeal. I agree with him in thinking
it absurd that the test for remoteness of damage should, in principle, differ
according to the legal classification of the cause of action, though one must
recognize that parties to a contract have the right to agree on a measure of
damages which may be greater, or less, than the law would offer in the absence of
agreement. I also agree with him in thinking that, notwithstanding the interpretation
put on some dicta in 
C Czarnikow Ltd
 
v. 
Koufos
 
[1969] AC 350, the law is not so
absurd as to differentiate between contract and tort save in situations where the
agreement, or the factual relationship, of the parties with each other requires it in
the interests of justice. I differ from him only to this extent: the cases do not, in my
judgment, support a distinction in law between loss of profit and physical damage.
Neither do I think it necessary to develop the law judicially by drawing such a
distinction. Of course (and this is a reason for refusing to draw the distinction in
law) the type of consequence—loss of profit or market or physical injury—will
always be an important matter of fact in determining whether in all the
circumstances the loss or injury was of a type which the parties could reasonably
be supposed to have in contemplation.
In 
C Czarnikow Ltd
 
v. 
Koufos
 
[1969] 1 AC 350 (a case of a contract of carriage
of goods by sea) the House of Lords resolved some of the difficulties in this branch
of the law. The law which the House in that case either settled or recognized as
already settled may be stated as follows. (1) The general principle regulating
damages for breach of contract is that ‘where a party sustains a loss by reason of
a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same
situation … as if the contract had been performed’: see per Lord Pearce, at p. 414,
quoting Parke B in 
Robinson
 
v. 
Harman
 
(1848) 1 Exch 850, 855. (2) The
formulation of the remoteness test is not the same in tort and in contract because
the relationship of the 
parties in a contract situation differs from that in tort: see per
Lord Reid, at pp. 385–386. (3) The two rules formulated by Alderson B in 
Hadley
 
v.
Baxendale
, 9 Exch. 341 are but two aspects of one general principle—that to be
recoverable in an action for damages for breach of contract the plaintiff’s loss must
be such as may reasonably be supposed would have been in the contemplation of
the parties as a serious possibility had their attention been directed to the
possibility of the breach which has, in fact, occurred.
Two problems are left unsolved by 
C Czarnikow Ltd
 
v. 
Koufos
: (1) the law’s
reconciliation of the remoteness principle in contract with that in tort where, as, for
instance, in some product liability cases, there arises the danger of differing
awards, the lesser award going to the party who has a contract, even though the
contract is silent as to the measure of damages and all parties are, or must be
deemed to be, burdened with the same knowledge, or enjoying the same state of
ignorance; and (2) what is meant by ‘serious possibility’ or its synonyms: is it a
reference to the type of consequence which the parties might be supposed to
contemplate as possible though unlikely, or must the chance of it happening
appear to be likely? (see the way Lord Pearce puts it, at pp. 416–417).
As to the first problem, I agree with Lord Denning MR in thinking that the law
must be such that, in a factual situation where all have the same actual or imputed
knowledge and the contract contains no term limiting the damages recoverable for
breach, the amount of damages recoverable does not depend upon whether, as a
matter of legal classification, the plaintiff’s cause of action is breach of contract or
tort. It may be that the necessary reconciliation is to be found, notwithstanding the
strictures of Lord Reid at pp. 389–390, in holding that the difference between
‘reasonably foreseeable’ (the test in tort) and ‘reasonably contemplated’ (the test in
contract) is semantic, not substantial. Certainly, Asquith LJ, in 
Victoria Laundry
(Windsor) Ltd
 
v. 
Newman Industries Ltd
 
[1949] 2 KB 528, 535 and Lord Pearce in
C Czarnikow Ltd
 
v. 
Koufos
 
[1969] 1 AC 350, 414 thought so; and I confess I think
so too.
The second problem—what is meant by a ‘serious possibility’—is, in my
judgment, ultimately a question of fact. I shall return to it, therefore, after analysing
the facts, since I believe it requires of the judge no more—and no less—than the
application of common sense in the particular circumstances of the case. …
The court’s task, therefore, is to decide what loss to the plaintiffs it is
reasonable to suppose would have been in the contemplation of the parties as a
serious possibility had they had in mind the breach when they made their contract.
I now turn to the facts of the case …
Given the situation of the parties at the time of contract, was the loss of profit,
or market, a serious possibility, something that would have been in their minds had
they contemplated breach?
It does not matter, in my judgment, if they thought that the chance of physical
injury, loss of profit, loss of market, or other loss as the case may be, was slight, or
that the odds were against it, provided they contemplated as a serious possibility
the type of consequence, not necessarily the specific consequence, that ensued
upon breach. Making the assumption as to breach that the judge did, no more than
common sense was needed for them to appreciate that food affected by bad
storage conditions might well cause illness if the pigs fed upon it.
As I read the judgment under appeal, this was how the judge … reached this
decision. In my judgment, he was right, upon the facts as found, to apply the first
rule in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
, 9 Exch 341 or, if the case be one of breach of
warranty, as I think it is, the rule in section 53(2) of the Sale of Goods Act 1893
without inquiring as to whether, upon a juridical analysis, the rule is based upon a
presumed contemplation. At the end of a long and complex dispute the judge
allowed common sense to prevail. I would dismiss the appeal.
Commentary
Parsons
 
is a difficult case because the Court of Appeal gave different reasons for
reaching the decision which it did. Lord Denning distinguished between physical
damage cases and economic loss cases but this distinction did not commend itself to
Scarman and Orr LJJ. The majority phrased the question at a high level of generality.
The question which they asked was not whether it was reasonably contemplated at the
time of contracting as a serious possibility that supplying a hopper with inadequate
ventilation would make the pigs ill. Rather they asked whether it was reasonably
contemplated at the time of contracting as a serious possibility that supplying a hopper
that was unfit for the purpose of storing food for pigs would make the pigs ill. As
Professor Burrows has pointed out (
Remedies for Torts, Breach of Contract and
Equitable Wrongs
 
(4th edn, Oxford University Press, 2019), p. 96), ‘Scarman LJ’s
approach shows that, by defining the breach more generally, the loss is less likely to be
judged too remote.’ It would appear that the courts do have a measure of discretion in
relation to the level of generality at which a breach is described, and the way in which
the courts choose to exercise that discretion can have a profound impact on the outcome
of a case. 
Parsons
 
also creates a difficulty in that it is not entirely easy to reconcile with
the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Victoria Laundry.
 
Put shortly, the broad approach
to the identification of the type of loss in 
Parsons
 
does not fit easily with the distinction
drawn in 
Victoria Laundry
 
between recoverable loss of ordinary profits and
irrecoverable loss of exceptional profits (see Burrows, 
Remedies for Torts, Breach of
Contract and Equitable Wrongs
, p. 96).
Further uncertainty was introduced into this area of law by the decision of the House of
Lords in 
Transfield Shipping Inc
 
v. 
Mercator Shipping Inc (The Achilleas)
 
[2008]
UKHL 48, [2009] 1 AC 61, which is now the leading modern decision on the law relating
to remoteness of damage. It is necessary to consider the case in some detail.
TRANSFIELD SHIPPING INC V. MERCATOR SHIPPING
INC (THE ACHILLEAS)
[2008] UKHL 48, [2009] 1 AC 61, House of Lords
A charterer of a vessel redelivered the vessel late and, as a result, the owners of
the vessel had to agree a reduced rate of hire for the follow-on time charter. They
claimed that their loss amounted to $8,000 per day for the duration of the follow-on
charter (which was 191 days). Thus they claimed $1,364,584 in damages. The
charterers submitted that their liability was confined to the difference between the
market and the charter rates of hire for the nine days during which the owners
were deprived of the use of the ship. On this basis damages amounted to
$158,301.17. It was found that the general understanding in the shipping market
was that liability was restricted to the difference between the market rate and the
charter rate for the overrun period. The House of Lords, allowing an appeal from
the decision of the Court of Appeal, held that liability was confined to the latter
figure.
Lord Hoffmann
9. The case … raises a fundamental point of principle in the law of contractual
damages: is the rule that a party may recover losses which were foreseeable (‘not
unlikely’) an external rule of law, imposed upon the parties to every contract in
default of express provision to the contrary, or is it a prima facie assumption about
what the parties may be taken to have 
intended, no doubt applicable in the great
majority of cases but capable of rebuttal in cases in which the context, surrounding
circumstances or general understanding in the relevant market shows that a party
would not reasonably have been regarded as assuming responsibility for such
losses? …

The question of principle has been extensively discussed in the literature.
Recent articles by Adam Kramer (‘An Agreement-Centred Approach to
Remoteness and Contract Damages’ in Cohen and McKendrick (ed), 
Comparative
Remedies for Breach of Contract
 
(2004) pp 249–286), Andrew Tettenborn (‘Hadley
v Baxendale Foreseeability: a Principle Beyond its Sell-by Date’ in (2007) 23
Journal of Contract Law
 
120–147) and Andrew Robertson (‘The basis of the
remoteness rule in contract’ (2008) 28 
Legal Studies
 
172–196) are particularly
illuminating. They show that there is a good deal of support in the authorities and
academic writings for the proposition that the extent of a party’s liability for
damages is founded upon the interpretation of the particular contract; not upon the
interpretation of any particular language in the contract, but (as in the case of an
implied term) upon the interpretation of the contract as a whole, construed in its
commercial setting. Professor Robertson considers this approach somewhat
artificial, since there is seldom any helpful evidence about the extent of the risks
the particular parties would have thought they were accepting. I agree that cases
of departure from the ordinary foreseeability rule based on individual
circumstances will be unusual, but limitations on the extent of liability in particular
types of contract arising out of general expectations in certain markets, such as
banking and shipping, are likely to be more common. There is, I think, an analogy
with the distinction which Lord Cross of Chelsea drew in 
Liverpool City Council v.
Irwin
 
[1977] AC 239, 257–258 between terms implied into all contracts of a certain
type and the implication of a term into a particular contract.
12.
 
It seems to me logical to found liability for damages upon the intention of
the parties (objectively ascertained) because all contractual liability is voluntarily
undertaken. It must be in principle wrong to hold someone liable for risks for which
the people entering into such a contract in their particular market, would not
reasonably be considered to have undertaken.
13.
 
The view which the parties take of the responsibilities and risks they are
undertaking will determine the other terms of the contract and in particular the price
paid. Anyone asked to assume a large and unpredictable risk will require some
premium in exchange. A rule of law which imposes liability upon a party for a risk
which he reasonably thought was excluded gives the other party something for
nothing. And as Willes J said in 
British Columbia Saw Mill Co Ltd v. Nettleship
(1868) LR 3 CP 499, 508:
‘I am disposed to take the narrow view, that one of two contracting parties ought not to be allowed to
obtain an advantage which he has not paid for.’
14. In their submissions to the House, the owners said that the ‘starting point’ was
that damages were designed to put the innocent party, so far as it is possible, in
the position as if the contract had been performed: see 
Robinson
 
v. 
Harman
 
(1848)
1 Exch 850, 855. However, in 
Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA
 
v. 
Eagle Star
Insurance Co Ltd
 
(sub nom 
South Australia Asset Management Corpn
 
v. 
York
Montague Ltd
) [1997] AC 191, 211, I said (with the concurrence of the other
members of the House):
‘I think that this was the wrong place to begin. Before one can consider the principle on which one
should calculate the damages to which a plaintiff is entitled as compensation for loss, it is necessary to
decide for what kind of loss he is entitled to compensation. A correct description of the loss for which the
valuer is liable must precede any consideration of the measure of damages.’
15. In other words, one must first decide whether the loss for which compensation
is sought is of a ‘kind’ or ‘type’ for which the contract-breaker ought fairly to be
taken to have accepted responsibility …
21.
 
It is generally accepted that a contracting party will be liable for damages
for losses which are unforeseeably large, if loss of that type or kind fell within one
or other of the rules in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
… That is generally an inclusive
principle: if losses of that type are foreseeable, damages will include compensation
for those losses, however large. But … it may also be an exclusive principle and
that a party may not be liable for foreseeable losses because they are not of the
type or kind for which he can be treated as having assumed responsibility.
22.
 
What is the basis for deciding whether loss is of the same type or a
different type? It is not a question of Platonist metaphysics. The distinction must
rest upon some principle of the law of contract. In my opinion, the only rational
basis for the distinction is that it reflects what would have been reasonable and
have been regarded by the contracting party as significant for the purposes of the
risk he was undertaking. In 
Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd
 
v. 
Newman Industries
Ltd
 
[1949] 2 KB 528, where the plaintiffs claimed for loss of the profits from their
laundry business because of late delivery of a boiler, the Court of Appeal did not
regard ‘loss of profits from the laundry business’ as a single type of loss. They
distinguished (at p 543) losses from ‘particularly lucrative dyeing contracts’ as a
different type of loss which would only be recoverable if the defendant had
sufficient knowledge of them to make it reasonable to attribute to him acceptance
of liability for such losses. The vendor of the boilers would have regarded the
profits on these contracts as a different and higher form of risk than the general
risk of loss of profits by the laundry.
23.
 
If, therefore, one considers what these parties, contracting against the
background of market expectations found by the arbitrators, would reasonably
have considered the extent of the liability they were undertaking, I think it is clear
that they would have considered losses arising from the loss of the following fixture
a type or kind of loss for which the charterer was not assuming responsibility. Such
a risk would be completely unquantifiable, because although the parties would
regard it as likely that the owners would at some time during the currency of the
charter enter into a forward fixture, they would have no idea when that would be
done or what its length or other terms would be. If it was clear to the owners that
the last voyage was bound to overrun and put the following fixture at risk, it was
open to them to refuse to undertake it. What this shows is that the purpose of the
provision for timely redelivery in the charterparty is to enable the ship to be at the
full disposal of the owner from the redelivery date. If the charterer’s orders will
defeat this right, the owner may reject them. If the orders are accepted and the last
voyage overruns, the owner is entitled to be paid for the overrun at the market rate.
All this will be known to both parties. It does not require any knowledge of the
owner’s arrangements for the next charter. That is regarded by the market as
being, as the saying goes, 
res inter alios acta
.
24.
 
The findings of the majority arbitrators [that the charterers were liable for
the loss on the new fixture because it arose naturally from the breach] shows that
they considered their decision to be contrary to what would have been the
expectations of the parties, but dictated by the rules in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
as
explained in 
The Heron II
 
[1969] 1 AC 350. But in my opinion these rules are not
so inflexible; they are intended to give effect to the presumed intentions of the
parties and not to contradict them. …
26.
 
The owners say that the parties are entirely at liberty to insert an express
term excluding consequential loss if they want to do so. Some standard forms of
charter do. I suppose it can be said of many disputes over interpretation, especially
over implied terms, that the parties could have used express words or at any rate
expressed themselves more clearly than they have done. But, as I have indicated,
the implication of a term as a matter of 
construction of the contract as a whole in its
commercial context and the implication of the limits of damages liability seem to
me to involve the application of essentially the same techniques of interpretation.
In both cases, the court is engaged in construing the agreement to reflect the
liabilities which the parties may reasonably be expected to have assumed and paid
for. It cannot decline this task on the ground that the parties could have spared it
the trouble by using clearer language. In my opinion, the findings of the arbitrators
and the commercial background to the agreement are sufficient to make it clear
that the charterer cannot reasonably be regarded as having assumed the risk of
the owner’s loss of profit on the following charter. I would therefore allow the
appeal.
Lord Hope of Craighead
31. Assumption of responsibility, which forms the basis of the law of remoteness of
damage in contract, is determined by more than what at the time of the contract
was reasonably foreseeable … The fact that the loss was foreseeable—the kind of
result that the parties would have had in mind, as the majority arbitrators put it—is
not the test. Greater precision is needed than that. The question is whether the
loss was a type of loss for which the party can reasonably be assumed to have
assumed responsibility …
34.
 
In this case it was within the parties’ contemplation that an injury which
would arise generally from late delivery would be loss of use at the market rate, as
compared with the charter rate, during the relevant period. This is something that
everybody who deals in the market knows about and can be expected to take into
account. But the charterers could not be expected to know how, if—as was not
unlikely—there was a subsequent fixture, the owners would deal with any new
charterers. This was something over which they had no control and, at the time of
entering into the contract, was completely unpredictable. Nothing was known at
that time about the terms on which any subsequent fixture might be entered into—
how short or long the period would be, for example, or what was to happen should
the previous charter overrun and the owner be unable to meet the new
commencement date. It is true that neither party had any control over the state of
the market. But in the ordinary course of things rates in the market will fluctuate.
So it can be presumed that the party in breach has assumed responsibility for any
loss caused by delay which can be measured by comparing the charter rate with
the market rate during that period. There can be no such presumption where the
loss claimed is not the product of the market itself, which can be contemplated, but
results from arrangements entered into between the owners and the new
charterers, which cannot. …
36. …
 
a party cannot be expected to assume responsibility for something that
he cannot control and, because he does not know anything about it, cannot
quantify. It is not enough for him to know in general and on open-ended terms that
there is likely to be a follow-on fixture … What he needs is some information that
will enable him to assess the extent of any liability. The policy of the law is that
effect should be given to the presumed intention of the parties. That is why the
damages that are recoverable for breach of contract are limited to what happens in
ordinary circumstances—in the great multitude of cases, as Alderson B put it in
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
—where an assumption of responsibility can be presumed, or
what arises from special circumstances known to or communicated to the party
who is in breach at the time of entering into the contract which because he knew
about he can be expected to provide for. This is a principle of general application.
We are dealing in this case with a highly specialised area of commercial law. But
the principle by which the issue must be resolved is that which applies in the law of
contract generally.
37.
 
For these reasons … I too would allow the appeal.
Lord Rodger of Earlsferry
53. … the extent of the relevant rise and fall in the market within a short time was
actually unusual. The owners’ loss stemmed from that unusual occurrence.
54.
 
The obligation of the charterers was to redeliver the vessel to the owners
by midnight on 2 May. Therefore, the charterers are taken to have had in
contemplation, at the time when they entered into the addendum, the loss which
would generally happen in the ordinary course of things if the vessel were
delivered some nine days late so that the owners missed the cancelling date for a
follow-on fixture. Obviously, that would include loss suffered as a result of the
owners not having been paid under the contract for the charterers’ use of the
vessel for the period after midnight on 2 May. So, as both sides agree, the owners
had to be compensated for that loss by the payment of damages. But the parties
would also have contemplated that, if the owners lost a fixture, they would then be
in a position to enter the market for a substitute fixture. Of course, in some cases,
the available market rate would be lower and, in some cases, higher, than the rate
under the lost fixture. But the parties would reasonably contemplate that, for the
most part, the availability of the market would protect the owners if they lost a
fixture. That I understand to be the thinking which lies behind the dicta to the effect
that the appropriate measure of damages for late redelivery of a vessel is the
difference between the charter rate and the market rate if the market rate is higher
than the charter rate for the period between the final terminal date and redelivery
…
58.
 
I would enter two caveats [to the principle set out in the last sentence of
[54]]. First, it may be that, at least in some cases, when concluding a charterparty,
a charterer could reasonably contemplate that late delivery of a vessel of that
particular type, in a certain area of the world, at a certain season of the year would
mean that the market for its services would be poor. In these circumstances, the
owners might have a claim for some general sum for loss of business, somewhat
along the line of the damages for the loss of business envisaged by the Court of
Appeal in 
Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd
 
v. 
Newman Industries Ltd
 
[1949] 2 KB
528, 542–543. Because of the agreement on figures, the matter was not explored
in this case and I express no view on it. But, even if some such loss of business
could have been reasonably contemplated, as 
Victoria Laundry
 
shows, this would
not mean that the owners’ particular loss of profit as a result of the re-negotiation
… should be recoverable. To hold otherwise would risk undermining the first limb of
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
, which limits the charterers’ liability to ‘the amount of injury’
that would arise ‘ordinarily’ or ‘generally’.
59.
 
Secondly, the position on damages might also be different, if, for example
—when a charterparty was entered into—the owners drew the charterers’ attention
to the existence of a forward charter of many months’ duration for which the vessel
had to be delivered on a particular date. The charterers would know that a failure
to redeliver the vessel in time to allow the owners to deliver it under that charter
would be liable to result in the loss of that fixture. Then the second rule or limb in
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
might well come into play. But the point does not arise in this
case.
60.
 
Returning to the present case, I am satisfied that, when they entered into
the addendum in September 2003, neither party would reasonably have
contemplated that an overrun of nine days would ‘in the ordinary course of things’
cause the owners the kind of loss for which they claim damages. That loss was not
the ‘ordinary consequence’ of a breach of that kind. It occurred in this case only
because of the extremely volatile market conditions which produced both the
owners’ initial (particularly lucrative) transaction, with a third party, and the
subsequent pressure on the owners to accept a lower rate for that fixture. Back in
September 2003, this loss could not have been reasonably foreseen as being
likely to arise 
out of the delay in question. It was, accordingly, too remote to give
rise to a claim for damages for breach of contract …
63.
 
I have not found it necessary to explore the issues concerning 
South
Australia Asset Management Corpn
 
v. 
York Montague Ltd
 
[1997] AC 191 and
assumption of responsibility, which my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann,
has raised. Nevertheless, I am otherwise in substantial agreement with his reasons
as well as with those to be given by Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe. I would allow
the appeal.
Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe
69. … the underlying idea—what was the common basis on which the parties were
contracting?—seems to me essential to the rule in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
as a
whole. Businessmen who are entering into a commercial contract generally know a
fair amount about each other’s business. They have a shared understanding
(differing in precision from case to case) as to what each can expect from the
contract, whether or not it is duly performed without breach on either side …
[He considered the authorities and the findings of the arbitrators and
concluded]
86. …
 
No doubt the fixture was made at an appropriate time … But it was
contrary to the principle stated in the 
Victoria Laundry
 
case, and reaffirmed in 
The
Heron II
, to suppose that the parties were contracting on the basis that the
charterers would be liable for any loss, however large, occasioned by a delay in re-
delivery in circumstances where the charterers had no knowledge of, or control
over, the new fixture entered into by the new owners.
87.
 
For these reasons, and for the further reasons given by my noble and
learned friends Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hope and Lord Rodger, whose opinions I
have had the advantage of reading in draft, I would allow this appeal.
Baroness Hale of Richmond
90. My Lords, this could be an examination question …
91. …
 
We are looking here at the general principles which limit a contract
breaker’s liability when the contract itself does not do so. The contract breaker is
not inevitably liable for all the loss which his breach has caused. Loss of the type in
question has to be ‘within the contemplation’ of the parties at the time when the
contract was made. It is not enough that it should be foreseeable if it is highly
unlikely to happen. It would not then arise ‘in the usual course of things’: see 
The
Heron II
 
[1969] 1 AC 350, 385, per Lord Reid. So one answer to our question,
given as I understand it by my noble and learned friend, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry,
is that these parties would not have had this particular type of loss within their
contemplation. They would expect that the owner would be able to find a use for
his ship even if it was returned late. It was only because of the unusual volatility of
the market at that particular time that this particular loss was suffered. It is one
thing to say, as did the majority arbitrators, that missing dates for a subsequent
fixture was within the parties’ contemplation as ‘not unlikely’. It is another thing to
say that the ‘extremely volatile’ conditions which brought about this particular loss
were ‘not unlikely’.
92.
 
Another answer to the question, given as I understand it by my noble and
learned friends, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope, is that one must ask, not only
whether the parties must be taken to have had this 
type of loss
 
within their
contemplation when the contract was made, but also whether they must be taken
to have had liability for this type of loss within their contemplation then. In other
words, is the charterer to be taken to have undertaken legal responsibility for this
type of loss? What should the unspoken terms of their contract be 
taken to be? If
that is the question, then it becomes relevant to ask what has been the normal
expectation of parties to such contracts in this particular market. If charterers
would not normally expect to pay more than the market rate for the days they were
late, and shipowners would not normally expect to get more than that, then one
would expect something extra before liability for an unusual loss such as this
would arise. That is essentially the reasoning adopted by the minority arbitrator.
93.
 
My Lords, I hope that I have understood this correctly, for it seems to me
that it adds an interesting but novel dimension to the way in which the question of
remoteness of damage in contract is to be answered, a dimension which does not
clearly emerge from the classic authorities. There is scarcely a hint of it in 
The
Heron II
, apart perhaps from Lord Reid’s reference, at p 385, to the loss being
‘sufficiently likely to result from the breach of contract 
to make it proper
 
to hold that
the loss flowed naturally from the breach or that loss of that kind should have been
within his contemplation’ (emphasis supplied). In general, 
The Heron II
 
points the
other way, as it emphasises that there are no special rules applying to
charterparties and that the law of remoteness in contract is not the same as the
law of remoteness in tort … To incorporate it generally would be to introduce into
ordinary contractual liability the principle adopted in the context of liability for
professional negligence in 
South Australia Asset Management Corpn
 
v. 
York
Montague Ltd
 
[1997] AC 191, 211. In an examination, this might well make the
difference between a congratulatory and an ordinary first class answer to the
question. But despite the excellence of counsels’ arguments it was not explored
before us, although it is explored in academic textbooks and other writings,
including those cited by Lord Hoffmann in paragraph 11 of his opinion. I note,
however, that the most recent of these, Professor Robertson’s article on ‘The basis
of the remoteness rule in contract’ (2008) 28 
Legal Studies
 
172 argues strongly to
the contrary. I am not immediately attracted to the idea of introducing into the law
of contract the concept of the scope of duty which has perforce had to be
developed in the law of negligence. The rule in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
asks what the
parties must be taken to have had in their contemplation, rather than what they
actually had in their contemplation, but the criterion by which this is judged is a
factual one. Questions of assumption of risk depend upon a wider range of factors
and value judgments. This type of reasoning is, as Lord Steyn put it in 
Aneco
Reinsurance Underwriting Ltd
 
v. 
Johnson & Higgins Ltd
 
[2002] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 157,
[186], a ‘deus ex machina’. Although its result in this case may be to bring about
certainty and clarity in this particular market, such an imposed limit on liability could
easily be at the expense of justice in some future case. It could also introduce
much room for argument in other contractual contexts. Therefore, if this appeal is
to be allowed, as to which I continue to have doubts, I would prefer it to be allowed
on the narrower ground identified by Lord Rodger, leaving the wider ground to be
fully explored in another case and another context.
Commentary
The case appears to signal a new approach to the recovery of damages, although its
precise ambit is unclear. It seems that it is no longer sufficient simply to show that the
loss which has been suffered is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the breach. In
deciding whether or not the loss is recoverable, it may be important to ask whether or
not the defendant accepted responsibility for the loss in respect of which the claim has
been brought. The expectation of the market would also appear to be an important
factor to take into account when deciding whether the defendant should be held
responsible for the loss which has been suffered.
Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope (at [15] and [32]) attached importance to the question
whether or not the defendant has, objectively, assumed responsibility for the loss in
question. Lord Hoffmann in particular sought to transplant the approach adopted in
South Australia Asset Management Corp
 
v. 
York Montague Ltd
 
[1997] AC 191 into the
law of contract more generally. Thus, for him, it was important to decide whether the
loss for which compensation is sought is of a ‘kind’ or a ‘type’ for which the contract-
breaker ought fairly to be taken to have accepted responsibility (see [15]). His analogy
with the law relating to implied terms should be noted (at [11]), a point which he
developed in his judgment in 
Attorney-General of Belize
 
v. 
Belize Telecom Ltd
 
[2009]
UKPC 10, [2009] 1 WLR 1988 (
10.4.1
 
and from which the Supreme Court has
subsequently distanced itself). On the facts of the present case he held, having regard to
the expectations of the market as found by the arbitrators who initially heard the case,
that contracting parties would not have considered losses arising from the loss of the
following fixture to be a type or kind of loss for which the charterer was assuming
responsibility.
Lord Hope also gave a central role to the idea that the defendant must have assumed
responsibility for the loss in question and, importantly, he added (at [31]) that
assumption of responsibility is ‘determined by more than what at the time of the
contract was reasonably foreseeable’. In his view the charterers had not assumed
responsibility for any follow-on charter which the owners concluded because they could
neither control that loss nor quantify it. It was not, in his judgment, sufficient that they
knew ‘in general and on open-ended terms’ that there was likely to be a follow-on
fixture.
Lord Rodger of Earlsferry did not find it necessary to explore the issues arising out of
South Australia Asset Management Corp
 
(at [63]), nor to consider the role, if any, of
assumption of responsibility in delimiting the scope of liability. In his view, the loss
suffered by the owners was not the ‘ordinary consequence’ of the breach of contract. The
loss arose as a result of the ‘extremely volatile market conditions’ which could not have
been reasonably foreseen as being likely to arise out of the delay (at [53] and to similar
effect see the judgment of Lord Hodge in 
Attorney-General of the Virgin Islands
 
v.
Global Water Associates Ltd
 
[2020] UKPC 18, [2021] AC 23, [26]). The difficulty with
this approach is that what was not foreseen was the extent of the loss, rather than its
nature. As Lord Rodger observed (at [53]), ‘the extent of the relevant rise and fall in the
market within a short time was actually unusual’. The problem which this approach
creates is that the law does not generally require the parties to foresee the extent of the
loss that has been suffered by the innocent party; rather, the law requires that the nature
or the kind of loss be reasonably foreseeable. In the present case, the kind of loss (the
loss of a subsequent fixture) was reasonably foreseeable and so it could be said that it
should have been recovered by the owners (a point made extrajudicially by Lord
Hoffmann in ‘
The Achilleas
: Custom and Practice or Foreseeability?’ [2010] 
Edinburgh
Law Review
 
47, 51–52).
Lord Walker also distinguished between the loss of a subsequent fixture and the
particular loss which the owners had suffered on the facts of the case. Thus he concluded
(at [83]) that it was open to the arbitrators to decide that it was not unlikely that the
delay would cause the owners to miss a subsequent fixture but that ‘it did not follow …
that the charterers were liable for an exceptionally large loss (measured by the entire
term of the fixture) when the market fell suddenly and sharply’. In his judgment the
parties had not contracted on the basis that the charterers would be liable for ‘any loss,
however large, occasioned by a delay in re-delivery in circumstances where the
charterers had no knowledge of, or control over, the new fixture entered into by the new
owners’ (see [86]).
Baroness Hale also expressed her doubts about the wisdom of incorporating into the law
of contract the principles set out by the House of Lords in 
South Australia Asset
Management 
Corp
 
(see [93]). She therefore decided the case ‘on the narrower ground
identified by Lord Rodger’ (at [93]). Thus she concluded that the ‘parties would not have
had this particular type of loss within their contemplation’. In her judgment, the parties
would have expected that the owner would be able to find a use for the ship even if it was
returned late and that ‘it was only because of the unusual volatility of the market at that
particular time that this particular loss was suffered’.
Although it is no easy task to discern the ratio of this case, it is possible to identify the
factors which persuaded the House of Lords to conclude that the loss was too remote.
The first was that their Lordships were clearly reluctant to conclude that a defendant
would accept responsibility for a potentially extensive liability which, at the time of entry
into the contract, it could neither know about nor control. The second related to the
expectations of the market. The general understanding of the shipping market was that
liability was restricted to the difference between the market rate and the charter rate for
the overrun period and this was a critical factor in persuading their Lordships to
conclude that the loss was not recoverable.
Returning to the difficulty of locating the ratio of the case, Lord Rodger and Baroness
Hale did not support the analysis adopted by Lord Hoffmann. The approach of Lord
Hope is similar to that adopted by Lord Hoffmann. Lord Walker’s analysis is more
difficult to discern. He stated (at [87]) that he agreed with the reasons given by Lords
Hoffmann, Hope, and Rodger. Further, he stated that he found the analogy with 
South
Australia Asset Management Corp
 
to be ‘helpful’ (at [79]) but stopped short of
positively endorsing it in a contractual context. Given Lord Walker’s apparent
endorsement of both approaches, what is the ratio of the case? The answer given by
Hamblen J in 
Sylvia Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
Progress Bulk Carriers Ltd (The Sylvia)
 
[2010]
EWHC 542 (Comm), [2010] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 81, [39] was that ‘the rationale of assumption
of responsibility’ had ‘the support of the majority’.
This leaves us with the difficulty of working out the relationship between the traditional
approach, based on 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
, and Lord Hoffmann’s assumption of
responsibility test. This issue was also considered by Hamblen J in 
The Sylvia
 
and he
concluded (at [40]–[41]) that:
the decision in 
The Achilleas
 
results in an amalgam of the orthodox and the broader approach. The orthodox
approach remains the general test of remoteness applicable in the great majority of cases. However, there may
be ‘unusual’ cases, such as 
The Achilleas
 
itself, in which the context, surrounding circumstances or general
understanding in the relevant market make it necessary specifically to consider whether there has been an
assumption of responsibility. This is most likely to be in those relatively rare cases where the application of the
general test leads or may lead to an unquantifiable, unpredictable, uncontrollable or disproportionate liability
or where there is clear evidence that such a liability would be contrary to market understanding and
expectations.
In the great majority of cases it will not be necessary specifically to address the issue of assumption of
responsibility. Usually the fact that the type of loss arises in the ordinary course of things or out of special
known circumstances will carry with it the necessary assumption of responsibility.
It is, however, unlikely that this rationalization is consistent with the intention of Lord
Hoffmann. Given his criticisms of the ‘high degree of indeterminacy’ produced by the
orthodox approach ([2010] 
Edinburgh Law Review
 
47, 52–53), it is likely that Lord
Hoffmann 
intended to displace it and not merely supplement it in the occasional case.
That said, Hamblen J’s approach has the merit of reducing the uncertainty which would
be created by elevating the assumption of responsibility test over the orthodox analysis.
Notwithstanding Lord Hoffmann’s own criticisms of the orthodox approach on the
ground that it generates uncertainty, the same difficulty would appear to be present in
his assumption of responsibility test. This point has been made most effectively by Paul
CK Wee (‘Contractual Interpretation and Remoteness’ [2010] 
LMCLQ
 
150). It suffices to
give one example and that relates to the application of Lord Hoffmann’s approach to the
facts of 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale.
 
Wee applies the test in the following way (at p. 170):
Under the agreement-centred approach, the critical question would have been: to whom would a reasonable
person have understood the parties’ agreement to allocate the risk of lost profits due to late delivery? The
parties had not expressly considered this issue. The lack of discussion in the judgments of any common practice
or understanding on this issue among common carriers suggests that no such understanding existed. The facts,
as reported, disclose no clues as to what the parties were likely to have intended in the circumstances that had
occurred; on the available evidence, it seems that a reasonable person would understand the parties’ agreement
not to have allocated the risk in question to anybody. … It appears that the fountainhead of the doctrine of
remoteness would itself pose a problem for the agreement-centred approach. It is simple to identify the
conclusion which the new approach would need to reach (ie, that the parties’ agreement allocated the risk of lost
profits due to late delivery to the claimants), but the inevitable limitations of the parties’ intentions make it
impossible to identify a reliable and consistent route to this conclusion. 
Hadley
 
itself therefore lends support to
the conclusion that the agreement-centred approach to remoteness is simply incapable, without resorting to
fiction, of providing an answer where the parties’ intentions run out.
Lord Hoffmann would, presumably, disagree with this criticism. Writing extrajudicially
([2010] 
Edinburgh Law Review
 
47, 57) he stated that:
what made the loss in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
 
unforeseeable by the carrier was that he lacked information in the
possession of the mill owner. He did not know how badly the mill owner needed to get the crank shaft replaced.
Further, as we have noted, Lord Hoffmann would claim that it is the orthodox approach
which is uncertain or ‘indeterminate’, not his approach.
Nevertheless, the ‘excessive and unnecessary uncertainty’ generated by Lord
Hoffmann’s approach led the Court of Appeal of Singapore to decline to follow it in
MFM Restaurants Pte Ltd
 
v. 
Fish & Co Restaurants Pte Ltd
 
[2010] SGCA 36, [2011] 1
SLR 150. Delivering the judgment of the court, Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA stated (at
[140]):
We … take this opportunity to state that the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann in 
The Achilleas
 
is not the
law in Singapore, except to the extent that the learned law lord’s reliance on the concept of assumption of
responsibility by the defendant is already incorporated or embodied in both limbs in 
Hadley
 
itself.
It is important to note the qualification relating to the extent to which the concept of
assumption of responsibility is already embodied within the two limbs of 
Hadley.
 
The
Singaporean 
Court of Appeal was of the view that the first limb of 
Hadley
 
necessarily
embodies an implied undertaking or assumption of responsibility on the part of the
defendant on the basis that the reasonable person in the position of the defendant would
be taken to have assumed responsibility for a loss that flowed naturally from the breach
(see [103]). This suggests that, in relation to limb one, there is little difference between
the two approaches. However, this view rests on the hypothesis that the assumption of
responsibility is implicit in the first limb of 
Hadley
 
and is not an additional element. If,
on the other hand, it is an additional element, then there is a difference between the two
approaches. In relation to the second limb of 
Hadley
, the Court of Appeal understood it
to rest solely on the actual knowledge of the defendant ([105]) and so perceived there to
be a difference between the two approaches. On the other hand, if the knowledge of the
defendant is seen as but one of the factors relevant to the second limb of 
Hadley
 
then
the difference between the two tests may not be great, given that, as we have noted
(earlier in this section), there is authority which supports the proposition that it must be
demonstrated that the defendant has accepted responsibility for the loss in question
before it can be recovered under the second limb of 
Hadley
.
Given that 
Transfield Shipping
 
is a decision of the House of Lords, it is not open to the
English courts (other than the Supreme Court) to go down the route taken by the
Singaporean Court of Appeal. The English courts must therefore apply Lord Hoffmann’s
approach where it is appropriate to do so. The difficulty lies in working out when it is
appropriate to do so and in ascertaining the relationship between the orthodox
approach in 
Hadley
 
and the approach of Lord Hoffmann. A possible rationalization of
the relationship between the two approaches was provided by Sir David Keene in 
John
Grimes Partnership Ltd
 
v. 
Gubbins
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 37, [2013] BLR 126. He stated (at
[24]):
[I]t seems to me to be right to bear in mind, as Lord Hoffmann emphasised in 
The Achilleas
, that one is dealing
with the law of contract, where the situation is governed by what has been agreed between the parties. If there is
no express term dealing with what types of losses a party is accepting potential liability for if he breaks the
contract, then the law in effect implies a term to determine the answer. Normally, there is an implied term
accepting responsibility for the types of losses which can reasonably be foreseen at the time of contract to be not
unlikely to result if the contract is broken. But if there is evidence in a particular case that the nature of the
contract and the commercial background, or indeed other relevant special circumstances, render that implied
assumption of responsibility inappropriate for a type of loss, then the contract-breaker escapes liability. Such
was the case in 
The Achilleas
.
The attempt that is made here is to rationalize both cases on the basis that they seek to
give effect to the presumed intention of the parties. The default rule is that to be found
in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale
, namely that the contract-breaker is to be held liable for the type
of loss which can reasonably be foreseen at the time of entry into the contract to be not
unlikely to result if the contract is broken. But it is open to the parties to contract out of
that default rule. And they can do so either way. They can restrict the liability of the
contract-breaker (as in 
The Achilleas
 
where the defendant was held not to be liable for a
loss that, on one view, could have been said to be reasonably foreseeable because it had
not assumed responsibility for that loss) or they can increase it (as in 
Supershield Ltd
 
v.
Siemens Building Technologies FE Ltd
 
[2010] EWCA Civ 7, [2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 349
where the defendant was held to have assumed a responsibility for a loss that would not
have occurred in ordinary circumstances).
A rather different approach was, however, adopted by the Privy Council in 
Attorney-
General of the Virgin Islands
 
v. 
Global Water Associates Ltd
 
[2020] UKPC 18, [2021]
AC 
23. The Government of the British Virgin Islands entered into two contracts with
Global Water Associates Ltd (‘GWA’) relating to a proposed water reclamation
treatment plant. The first contract was a Design Build Agreement (‘DBA’) under which
GWA agreed to design and build the plant. The second contract was a Management,
Operation and Maintenance Agreement (‘MOMA’) under which the government
engaged GWA to manage, operate, and maintain the plant at the site. In breach of the
DBA the government failed to provide a site to enable the installation of the plant. The
plant was therefore not built. The issue before the Privy Council was whether GWA
could recover its losses under the MOMA in its claim for damages for breach of the DBA.
The Privy Council held that it could and that such losses were not too remote a
consequence of the government’s breach of the DBA.
The principal interest of the case for our purpose lies in the way in which the Privy
Council treated the decision in 
The Achilleas
. Rather than being seen as the central
authority on the remoteness of damage, it was cast to the margins. Lord Hodge (at [26])
described the assumption of responsibility test as set out by Lord Hoffmann and Lord
Hope as a ‘further limitation on contractual damages’ and (at [29]) as a ‘further
restriction on recoverability’ as if it were a test that somehow operated independently of
the normal remoteness rules. This is certainly not how Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope
understood the test and it is likely that the status and the scope of 
The Achilleas
 
will be
the subject of further judicial analysis.
Instead of relying upon 
The Achilleas
 
Lord Hodge placed more reliance on authorities
such as 
The Heron II
 
and 
Victoria Laundry
. On the basis of these authorities he
concluded that the losses resulting from the inability of GWA to earn profits under the
MOMA were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties to the DBA when they
entered into the contract. This was so for a number of reasons. First, the two contracts
were entered into between the same parties on the same day and they both related to the
same plant and so were losses which could reasonably be supposed to have been in the
contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract as the probable result
of the breach of it within the second limb of the rule in 
Hadley
 
v. 
Baxendale.
 
Secondly,
the government when it entered into the DBA knew and intended that the performance
of each party’s obligations under the DBA would lead to the commencement of the
MOMA. Thirdly, the terms of the two contracts were clearly closely related to one
another. Fourthly, there was no express or implied term in the DBA which limited the
government’s liability in damages to GWA’s loss of earnings under the DBA. The losses
were therefore not too remote a consequence of the breach of contract. However, the
influence of the case lies not so much in the application of these principles to the facts of
the case but in the emphasis given by the Privy Council to the traditional tests set out in
cases such as 
The Heron II
 
and 
Victoria Laundry
 
in preference to 
The Achilleas
.
23.8.2
 
Mitigation
The claimant must take reasonable steps to minimize the loss suffered by a breach of
contract (
British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co Ltd
 
v. 
Underground
Electric Railways Co of London Ltd
 
[1912] AC 673). This is commonly expressed in the
formula that a claimant is under a ‘duty’ to mitigate his loss. This terminology is,
however, misleading. A claimant is not under a duty to mitigate his loss, in the sense
that he can be sued if he fails to do so. The sanction for a failure to mitigate is that a
claimant cannot recover damages in respect of losses attributable to his failure to do so.
As Professor Bridge notes (‘Mitigation of Damages in Contract and the Meaning of
Avoidable Loss’ (1989) 105 
LQR
 
398, 399), the language of ‘duty’ is misleading, but it is
‘well entrenched and difficult to substitute’.
There are two aspects to the mitigation doctrine. The first is that the claimant must not
unreasonably increase the loss suffered as a result of the breach (
Banco de Portugal
 
v.
Waterlow & Sons Ltd
 
[1932] AC 452). The second is that the claimant must take
reasonable steps to minimize his loss. The claimant need only take 
reasonable
 
steps
and, in this respect, the law does not make onerous demands of a claimant (
Pilkington
 
v.
Wood
 
[1953] Ch 770). The defendant, as a contract-breaker, is not in a position to ask
the court to make onerous demands. As Tomlinson J observed in 
Britvic Soft Drinks Ltd
v. 
Messer UK Ltd
 
[2002] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 20, 46 the law of contract adopts a ‘tender
approach to those who have been placed in a predicament by a breach of contract’.
Whether or not an innocent party has taken reasonable steps is a question of fact. Where
the claimant takes steps to mitigate the loss consequent on the defendant’s breach of
contract and these steps are successful, the defendant is entitled to the benefit which
accrues from the claimant’s action and is liable for the loss as reduced by the claimant’s
actions (
Thai Airways International Public Co Ltd
 
v. 
KI Holdings Co Ltd
 
[2015] EWHC
1250 (Comm)). But where the step taken by the claimant is an independent act which
does not reduce the particular loss in respect of which the claimant is seeking to recover
damages, a court may conclude that it is not to be regarded as an act of mitigation so
that the claimant is not required to bring into account any benefit which accrues to it
from the step which it has taken (see 
Globalia Business Travel SAU of Spain
 
v. 
Fulton
Shipping Inc of Panama
 
[2017] UKSC 43, [2017] 1 WLR 2581, where it was held that a
ship owner was not obliged to bring into account the capital gain which it had realized
from the sale of the ship in order to offset the loss of income which it had suffered on the
hire of the vessel as a result of its wrongful termination by the hirer).
Three points should be noted about the doctrine of mitigation. The first is that it
amounts to a substantial qualification to the protection which the law affords to the
claimant’s performance interest. It means that, in the case where the claimant can
reasonably obtain substitute performance in the marketplace, the claimant must go out
and obtain that performance: he cannot sit back and wait for the defendant to perform
in accordance with the terms of the contract. Of course, the law does not actually compel
the claimant to go out into the marketplace and purchase substitute performance but
the fact that the claimant cannot recover damages in respect of losses attributable to his
failure to mitigate gives him a substantial incentive to do so. The claimant who goes out
into the marketplace and purchases substitute performance will be entitled to recover as
damages the difference between the price under the substitute transaction and the
contract price. In this way the claimant can obtain performance at the price which was
agreed in the contract but not from the party who promised to provide it.
Secondly, the doctrine of mitigation can have the effect of requiring the innocent party
to consider, and possibly accept, an offer of alternative performance by the party in
breach. Such was the case in one of the leading mitigation cases, 
Payzu Ltd
 
v. 
Saunders
[1919] 2 KB 581. The defendants entered into a contract with the plaintiffs under which
they agreed to sell to the plaintiffs a quantity of silk, to be delivered in instalments. The
contract provided that payment was to be made within one month following delivery of
each instalment. The plaintiffs failed to pay the first instalment on time. This led the
defendants to the erroneous conclusion that the plaintiffs were unable to pay at all
(when in fact the cause of late payment was simply that they had had difficulty in getting
the cheque signed by one of their directors). Fearing that the plaintiffs were facing
insolvency, the defendants wrote to the plaintiffs and informed them that they would
not make any further deliveries unless the plaintiffs paid for each instalment in cash on
delivery. The plaintiffs refused to accept these terms. They brought an action for
damages and sought to recover the difference between the 
contract price and the market
price of the silk (at the time the market price was rising). It was held that the plaintiffs
were not entitled to recover the difference in price on the ground that their rejection of
the defendants’ offer to supply the silk on cash terms constituted a failure to mitigate
their loss. Scrutton LJ stated that, in a case involving a commercial contract, it is
generally reasonable to expect a party to consider and accept a reasonable offer made by
the party in breach of contract (the position is otherwise in the case of a contract for
personal services: see 
Clayton-Greene
 
v. 
De Courville
 
(1920) 36 TLR 790).
Payzu
 
was taken a step further in 
Sotiros Shipping Inc
 
v. 
Sameiet Solholt (The Solholt)
[1983] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 605 (CA), [1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 574 (Staughton J). The buyers of a
ship lawfully terminated a contract on the ground that the sellers were late in tendering
delivery of the vessel. The contract price was $5 million. At the time of the breach the
market price had risen to $5.5 million and the sellers later sold the vessel for $5.8
million. The buyers’ claim for damages assessed by reference to the difference between
the contract price and the market price was rejected on the ground that they had failed
to mitigate their loss. There was no evidence that the sellers had offered to sell the ship
to the buyers for $5 million after the termination of the contract, but Staughton J, the
judge at first instance, held that the buyers had failed to mitigate because they should
have offered to buy the vessel for $5 million rather than claim $500,000 in damages.
The Court of Appeal dismissed the buyers’ appeal. While they clearly had doubts about
the decision of Staughton J, they were not prepared to interfere with his finding that the
buyers had failed to act reasonably. While the result in 
The Solholt
 
has received support
on the basis that it recognizes the value of the re-negotiation of contracts, it can be
criticized on three substantial grounds. First, it rendered the buyer’s right to reject the
vessel illusory. There seems to be no point in exercising a right to reject if the buyer then
has to make an offer to purchase the rejected goods at the contract price (at least in the
case of a rising market). Secondly, it entitled the sellers to retain the profits attributable
to the rise in the market price of the vessel. They were able to keep the difference
between the contract price of $5 million and the price of $5.8 million for which they
eventually sold the vessel when they should have been entitled to retain the difference
between the market price at the date of the breach ($5.5 million) and the price for which
they sold the vessel ($5.8 million). In effect, they were enriched to the extent of
$500,000 by their breach of contract. Thirdly, mitigation relates to the avoidance of
losses and, on the facts of 
The Solholt
, the loss had already occurred at the date of
breach (in the sense that the market price had already moved) and the question for the
court was which party was to take the benefit of the rise in the market price. On the facts
it was held that it was the sellers, the party in breach, who were entitled to retain the rise
in the market price. As Professor Bridge has observed ((1989) 109 
LQR
 
389, 421–422):
[I]f one had to speculate on the failure to recognise principle in 
Payzu
 
and 
The Solholt
, it would be on the
ground that the law’s insistence upon treating the possibility of mitigation as a question of fact, together with a
preoccupation with the reasonableness of the plaintiff’s conduct, has created an intellectual vacuum.
Given these criticisms, a court may be slow to require an innocent party to take the
initiative in this way and may instead put the onus on the contract-breaker to put
forward a properly formulated proposal to the innocent party which it could not
reasonably refuse (
Manton Hire and Sales Ltd
 
v. 
Ash Manor Cheese Co Ltd
 
[2013]
EWCA Civ 548).
The final point to be noted in relation to the doctrine of mitigation is that it can be seen
as part of a broader principle that a claimant must act reasonably. This principle can be
seen 
at work in 
Ruxley
 
(
23.3
) where Lord Lloyd stated he did not accept the submission
that ‘reasonableness is confined to the doctrine of mitigation’. The ‘obligation’ to act
reasonably can extend into matters such as the measure of recovery to which the
claimant is entitled (i.e., whether it is cost of cure or difference in value).
23.8.3
 
Contributory Negligence
A controversial issue has been the question whether or not it is possible to reduce the
damages payable to the claimant on the ground that the claimant’s carelessness has
contributed to the losses that he has suffered. The problem here relates to the
application of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 to contractual claims.
The Act seems to have been drafted with tort claims in mind, particularly claims in the
tort of negligence, and the consequence is that the concepts that it employs, particularly
the notion of ‘fault’, do not translate easily into a contractual context.
In determining whether or not contributory negligence can be invoked as a defence
by a defendant who is sued for damages for breach of contract, the courts in England
and Wales distinguish between three different types of claim. The first is a case in which
the defendant’s liability arises from a breach of a contractual provision which does not
depend on a failure to take reasonable care; that is to say the breach of a strict
contractual duty. Contributory negligence is not available as a defence to such a claim.
The second is a case in which liability arises from an express contractual obligation to
take care which does not correspond to any duty which would exist independently of the
contract. Once again, contributory negligence is not available as a defence to such a
claim. The third case is one in which the liability for breach of contract is the same as,
and coextensive with, a liability in tort independently of the existence of a contract.
Contributory negligence is available as a defence to such a claim. The operation of these
rules is illustrated by the following case:
BARCLAYS BANK PLC V. FAIRCLOUGH BUILDING LTD
[1995] QB 214, Court of Appeal
The defendant contractors, Fairclough, agreed to carry out work for the plaintiff,
Barclays Bank, at Millbrook Industrial Estate, Wythenshawe. A significant part of
that work required the defendant to clean and treat some asbestos cement sheets.
The contract did not specify the method by which the work was to be done, but it
was a condition of the contract that all roofing work should be executed by a
specialist firm of roofing contractors or by the defendant’s own craftsmen if
properly experienced in such work. The defendant sub-contracted the work to a
sub-contractor who used high-pressure hoses to jet clean the sheets. As a result of
the way in which the work was done the building became heavily contaminated
with asbestos dust which necessitated extensive remedial works at a cost of
approximately £4m. Neither the defendant, nor the sub-contractor, had taken any
of the recommended precautions when using the high-pressure hose method of
cleaning the asbestos roofs. The defendant accepted that it was seriously in
breach of the terms of the contract. The defendant breached two of the main
obligations under the contract. First, there was a clear breach of the defendant’s
obligation to carry out the work in accordance with the specification and to achieve
the standard specified. The defendant’s failure in this respect 
was a breach of a
strict obligation and not simply a failure to exercise reasonable care and skill.
Secondly, the defendant’s failure to comply with the requirements of the Asbestos
Regulations of 1987 was itself a breach of contract. The defendant alleged that the
plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence in that, through its safety officer
and its supervising officer, it should have drawn the defendant’s attention to the
dangers and the supervising officer could and should have insisted on compliance
with the terms of the contract.
The plaintiff brought an action to recover damages for the losses that it had
suffered. The trial judge awarded the plaintiff substantial damages but reduced the
award by 40 per cent under sections 1(1) and 4 of the Law Reform (Contributory
Negligence) Act 1945 on the ground that the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory
negligence. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal which allowed the appeal
and held that the damages payable to the plaintiff did not fall to be reduced under
the 1945 Act.
Beldam LJ
Breach of contract and contributory negligence
The common law rule that in an action in tort a plaintiff whose own fault contributed
with the defendant’s to cause his damage could recover nothing was perceived to
be unfair and, as a result of the Law Revision Committee’s Eighth Report
(Contributory Negligence) (1939) (Cmd. 6032), the Law Reform (Contributory
Negligence) Act 1945 was passed. Its purpose was to enable a court in actions of
tort to apportion responsibility for the damage suffered by the plaintiff where there
had been fault by both parties. It is the definition of ‘fault’ under section 4 which
has since 1945 given rise to continuing debate and uncertainty whether the court’s
ability to apportion damages applies to a case in which the plaintiff’s cause of
action lies in contract. After nearly half a century of extensive academic analysis,
inconclusive discussion in a number of decided cases and conflicting
Commonwealth decisions, the position remained uncertain and in 1989 the Law
Commission published Working Paper No 114, Contributory Negligence as a
Defence in Contract. In this consultation paper the competing arguments based on
the interpretation of section 4 and the state of the law as it then appeared to be
were fully examined. After consultation the Commission reported its
recommendations in December 1993, Contributory Negligence as a Defence in
Contract (Law Com. No 219). In the light of this extensive review of the law, a short
summary of the position is in my view sufficient for the purposes of the present
case.
Section 4 of the Act defines ‘fault’:
‘“fault” means negligence, breach of statutory duty or other act or omission which gives rise to a liability
in tort or would, apart from this Act, give rise to the defence of contributory negligence; …’
It is generally agreed that the first part of the definition relates to the defendant’s
fault and the second part to the plaintiff’s but debate has focused on the words ‘or
other act or omission which gives rise to a liability in tort’ in the first part and ‘other
act or omission which … would, apart from this Act, give rise to the defence of
contributory negligence’ in the second part. It has been argued that, merely
because the plaintiff frames his cause of action as a breach of contract, if the acts
or omissions on which he relies could equally well give rise to a liability in tort the
defendant is entitled to rely on the defence of contributory negligence. Examples
frequently cited are claims for damages against an employer or by a passenger
against a railway or bus company where the plaintiff may frame his action either in
tort or in contract and the duty relied on in either case is a duty to take reasonable
care for 
the plaintiff’s safety. Contributory negligence has been a defence in such
actions for many years. So it is argued that, in all cases in which the contractual
duty broken by a defendant is the same as and is coextensive with a similar duty in
tort, the defendant may now rely on the defence. An opposing view based on the
second part of the definition is that, if the plaintiff framed his action for breach of
contract, contributory negligence at common law was never regarded as a defence
to his claim and so cannot be relied on under the Act of 1945.
Under the first part of the definition, if the plaintiff claims damages for breach of
a contractual term which does not correspond with a duty in tort to take reasonable
care, the defendant’s acts or omissions would not give rise to a liability in tort and
accordingly no question of contributory negligence could arise.
These arguments have led courts to classify contractual duties under three
headings: (i) where a party’s liability arises from breach of a contractual provision
which does not depend on a failure to take reasonable care; (ii) where the liability
arises from an express contractual obligation to take care which does not
correspond to any duty which would exist independently of the contract; (iii) where
the liability for breach of contract is the same as, and coextensive with, a liability in
tort independently of the existence of a contract. This analysis was adopted by
Hobhouse J in 
Forsikringsaktieselskapet Vesta
 
v. 
Butcher
 
[1986] 2 All ER 488 and
by the Court of Appeal in the same case [1989] AC 852, 860, 862, 866–867. The
judgments in the Court of Appeal in that case assert that in category (iii) cases the
Court of Appeal is bound by the decision in 
Sayers
 
v. 
Harlow Urban District Council
[1958] 1 WLR 623 to admit the availability of the defence.
Since I do not regard the case before the court as being in that category, I am
content to accept that decision. To regard the definition of fault in section 4 as
extending to cases such as employer’s liability places no great strain on the
construction of the words used …
On the other hand, in category (i) cases there is no decision in which
contributory negligence has been held to be a partial defence. There are powerful
dicta to the effect that it cannot be. …
The defendant’s argument that, because the plaintiff owed duties to its
employees it was therefore under a duty in its own interest to see that the
defendant fulfilled its obligations under the contract, is inconsistent with many
cases in which it has been held that employers and others liable to third parties for
failure of plant or equipment are entitled to rely on warranties given by their
suppliers …
The present case
I have already stated my conclusion that in the present case the defendant was in
breach of two conditions which required strict performance and did not depend on
a mere failure to take reasonable care. Nevertheless it was argued by Mr Butcher
[counsel for the defendant] in support of the respondent’s notice that the defendant
could have been held liable in tort for the same acts or omissions. By creating the
asbestos dust it was guilty of nuisance. Further the settling of the dust on the
storage racks and floors of the plaintiff’s building amounted to trespass. I would
reject these submissions.
On the other hand, Mr Elliott [counsel for the plaintiff] addressed arguments to
the court that the defendant would not have been found liable to the plaintiff in
negligence, for the only damage proved was economic loss. These arguments
amply justified the fears expressed by the Law Commission in its 1993 report (Law
Com. No 219) that actions for breach of a strict contractual obligation would
become unduly complex if contributory negligence were admitted as a partial
defence by introducing an element of uncertainty into many straightforward
commercial disputes and increasing the issues to be determined.
In my judgment therefore in the present state of the law contributory negligence
is not a defence to a claim for damages founded on breach of a strict contractual
obligation. I do not believe the wording of the Law Reform (Contributory
Negligence) Act 1945 can reasonably sustain an argument to the contrary. Even if
it did, in the present case the nature of the contract and the obligation undertaken
by the skilled contractor did not impose on the plaintiff any duty in its own interest
to prevent the defendant from committing the breaches of contract. To hold
otherwise would, I consider, be equivalent to implying into the contract an
obligation on the part of the plaintiff inconsistent with the express terms agreed by
the parties. The contract clearly laid down the extent of the obligations of the
plaintiff as architect and of the defendant. It was the defendant who was to provide
appropriate supervision on site, not the architect …
For the reasons I have given, I would allow the appeal.
Simon Brown LJ
I for my part would accept Hobhouse J’s view expressed in
Forsikringsaktieselskapet Vesta
 
v. 
Butcher
 
[1986] 2 All ER 488, 509–510, that
apportionment of blame and liability is open to the court in any ordinary category
(iii) case, unless the parties by their contract have varied that position, because, as
he explained:
‘there is independently of contract a status or common law relationship which exists between the parties
and which can then give rise to tortious liabilities which fall to be adjusted in accordance with the Act of
1945.’
In short, the contract in such cases really adds nothing to the common law position
…
But when, as in a category (i) case, the contractual liability is by no means
immaterial, when rather it is a strict liability arising independently of any negligence
on the defendant’s part, then there seem to me compelling reasons why the
contract, even assuming it is silent as to apportionment, should be construed as
excluding the operation of the Act of 1945. The very imposition of a strict liability on
the defendant is to my mind inconsistent with an apportionment of the loss. And
not least because of the absurdities that the contrary approach carries in its wake.
Assume a defendant, clearly liable under a strict contractual duty. Is his position to
be improved by demonstrating that besides breaching that duty he was in addition
negligent? Take this very case. Is this contract really to be construed so that the
defendant is advantaged by an assertion of its own liability in nuisance or trespass
as well as in contract? Are we to have trials at which the defendant calls an expert
to implicate him in tortious liability, whilst the plaintiff’s expert seeks paradoxically
to exonerate him? The answer to all these questions is surely ‘No’. Whatever
arguments exist for apportionment in other categories of case—and these are
persuasively deployed in the 1993 Law Commission Report (Law Com. No 219)—
to my mind there are none in the present type of case and I for my part would
construe the contract accordingly. For these reasons in addition to those given by
Beldam LJ, I, too, would allow this appeal.

Commentary
In many ways, the litigation in 
Fairclough
 
demonstrates the controversies that currently
exist in this area of law. The law currently compels the parties to take up unusual
positions. For example, it was the defendant in 
Fairclough
 
who argued that it was liable
to the plaintiff 
in tort and it did so for the purpose of seeking to invoke the defence of
contributory negligence. By contrast, the plaintiff argued that the defendant was not
liable in tort so that it could avoid the application of the defence. It is, to say the least,
very odd to give an incentive to a defendant to admit a liability for the purpose of
seeking to reduce his liability (or, to view the same issue from the perspective of the
claimant, to put the claimant in the position of denying that he has a particular claim for
the purpose of increasing the size of his claim against the defendant). But this is the
position that English law has currently reached. If the law is to change, which direction
should the change take? One approach would be to conclude that contributory
negligence should always be available as a defence to a claim in contract so as to give to
claimants an incentive to take steps to ensure that losses are not unreasonably
increased. It can also be argued that the wider availability of contributory negligence as
a defence will enable courts to reach fairer results on the facts of the cases that come
before them. Contributory negligence is typically a partial defence and so it can be
tailored to meet the facts of the individual case. Doctrines of mitigation and break in the
chain of causation, by contrast, operate in an all-or-nothing fashion. As Professor
Burrows has observed (‘Limitations on Compensation’ in A Burrows and E Peel (eds),
Commercial Remedies: Current Issues and Problems
 
(Oxford University Press, 2003),
pp. 27, 41):
[I]t seems wrong in terms of policy for the law to be that a claimant may be wholly barred from receiving
damages because of the claimant’s own fault, through the application of the duty to mitigate or intervening
cause, while there is no mid-position where damages may be merely reduced. The denial of contributory
negligence unsatisfactorily forces the courts to choose between the blameworthy claimant recovering 100 per
cent damages or no damages for the particular loss in question.
The alternative is to conclude that contributory negligence should not have a role to play
in contractual claims on the ground that the claimant has paid for the performance by
the defendant of his contractual duties and, provided that the loss to the claimant is
caused by the defendant’s breach of contract, the law should not impose upon a claimant
an obligation to take reasonable steps to ensure that the defendant is performing his
contractual obligations or to take reasonable care to ensure that loss is not suffered as a
result of the defendant’s failure to perform his contractual obligations. The latter
approach was taken by the High Court of Australia in 
Astley
 
v. 
Austrust Limited
 
(1999)
197 CLR 1, 31, 36–37, where Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, and Hayne JJ concluded
as follows:
In our opinion, those decisions which have applied apportionment legislation, based on the Law Reform
(Contributory Negligence) Act (UK), to breaches of contract are wrong and should not be followed in this
country. The interpretation of the legislation adopted by those courts which have applied the legislation to
contract claims is strained, to say the least … when the nature of an action for breach of a contractual term to
take reasonable care and the nature of an action in tort for breach of a general law duty of care are examined, it
is by no means evident that there is anything anomalous or unfair in a plaintiff who sues in contract being
outside the scope of the apportionment legislation. Tort obligations are imposed on the parties; contractual
obligations are voluntarily assumed …
In contract, the plaintiff gives consideration, often very substantial consideration, for the defendant’s
promise to take reasonable care. The terms of the contract allocate responsibility for the risks of the parties’
enterprise including the risk that the damage suffered by one 
party may arise partly from the failure of that
party to take reasonable care for the safety of that person’s property or person. Ordinarily, that risk is borne by
the party whose breach of contract is causally connected to the damage. Rarely do contracts apportion
responsibility for damage on the basis of the respective fault of the parties. Commercial people in particular
prefer the certainty of fixed rules to the vagueness of concepts such as ‘just and equitable’. That is why it is
commonplace for contracts to contain provisions regulating liability for breach of a duty to take reasonable care,
whether by excluding liability altogether or limiting it in some other way.
Absent some contractual stipulation to the contrary, there is no reason of justice or sound legal policy which
should prevent the plaintiff in a case such as the present recovering for all the damage that is causally connected
to the defendant’s breach even if the plaintiff’s conduct has contributed to the damage which he or she has
suffered. By its own voluntary act, the defendant has accepted an obligation to take reasonable care and, subject
to remoteness rules, to pay damages for any loss or damage flowing from a breach of that obligation.

Negotiating Damages and Account of
Profits
A claimant may seek to recover damages assessed by reference to the sum that he or she
could hypothetically have received in return for releasing the defendant from the
obligation which it failed to perform. Or a claimant could seek to recover the profit
which the defendant has made as a result of its breach of contract. Both types of claim
have given rise to a considerable degree of controversy in recent times. In relation to the
first of these claims, the controversy has centred on the nature of the claim (is it a claim
brought in respect of a loss which has been suffered by the claimant or is it to recover a
share of the profit which the defendant has made?) and the circumstances in which it
can be brought. The controversy in relation to the latter claim is whether or not a
claimant is ever entitled to recover the entirety of the profit made by the defendant as a
result of its breach of contract. The House of Lords in 
Attorney-General
 
v. 
Blake
 
[2001]
1 AC 268 held on the rather unusual facts of that case that the Attorney-General was
entitled to recover all of the profit made by Mr Blake as a result of his breach of contract,
but the case has since been confined within very narrow limits and it is probably
unlikely that it will be followed, at least in the case where the parties to the contract are
both commercial parties engaged in an ordinary business transaction. Accordingly, we
shall focus attention on the first of the two claims, now known as a claim for negotiating
damages in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court in the following case:
ONE STEP (SUPPORT) LTD V. MORRIS-GARNER
[2018] UKSC 20, [2019] AC 649, Supreme Court
The claimant company brought an action against two defendants. The first
defendant had been an employee and a 50 per cent shareholder in the claimant,
while the second defendant had been an employee of the claimant. The claimant
sought to recover damages in 
respect of breaches by the defendants of three-year
covenants into which they had entered with the claimant in December 2006, under
which the defendants had agreed not to compete with the claimant, solicit its
clients, or make use of its confidential information. The defendants breached these
covenants by setting up a new company in 2007 which did in fact compete with the
claimant. On discovering the existence of the company in February 2008, the
claimant threatened to bring proceedings against the defendants for an injunction
but in the event did not proceed further with the claim. After the expiry of the three-
year period, the claimant commenced proceedings against the defendants in July
2012. The company set up by the defendants in 2007 meanwhile had done
extremely well, and the defendants sold their shares in that company for £12.8
million in September 2010. On the other hand, the claimant’s business
‘experienced a significant downturn’. The claimant’s expert estimated that the loss
which the claimant had sustained as a result of the defendants’ breaches was
between £3.4 million and £4.6 million. However, the same expert estimated that
the fee which the claimant would have obtained for the release of the defendants
from their covenants was between £5.6 million and £6.3 million. The claimant
therefore sought to recover damages assessed by reference to the fee which it
would have obtained from releasing the defendants from their obligations under
the covenants. The claimant was successful both at first instance and in the Court
of Appeal but it failed in its claim before the Supreme Court, who held that the
claimant was entitled to recover in respect of the loss which it could prove it had
suffered as a result of the defendants’ breaches but that it was not entitled to
recover negotiating damages.
Lord Reed [with whom Lady Hale, Lord Wilson and Lord
Carnwath agreed]
1. This appeal raises an important question in relation to the law of damages: in
what circumstances can damages for breach of contract be assessed by reference
to the sum that the claimant could hypothetically have received in return for
releasing the defendant from the obligation which he failed to perform? …
[Lord Reed stated that the term ‘negotiating damages’ would be used to denote
this type of claim and proceeded to examine in some detail the authorities and the
historical development of this area of law and continued]
91.
 
The use of an imaginary negotiation can give the impression that
negotiation damages are fundamentally incompatible with the compensatory
purpose of an award of contractual damages. Damages for breach of contract
depend on considering the outcome if the contract had been performed, whereas
an award based on a hypothetical release fee depends on considering the
outcome if the contract had not been performed but had been replaced by a
different contract. That impression of fundamental incompatibility is, however,
potentially misleading. There are certain circumstances in which the loss for which
compensation is due is the economic value of the right which has been breached,
considered as an asset. The imaginary negotiation is merely a tool for arriving at
that value. The real question is as to the circumstances in which that value
constitutes the measure of the claimant’s loss.
92. …
 
such circumstances can exist in cases where the breach of contract
results in the loss of a valuable asset created or protected by the right which was
infringed, as for example in cases concerned with the breach of a restrictive
covenant over land, an intellectual property agreement or a confidentiality
agreement. … The claimant has in substance been deprived of a valuable asset,
and his loss can therefore be measured by determining the economic value of the
asset in question. The defendant has taken something for nothing, for which the
claimant was entitled to require payment.
93.
 
It might be objected that there is a sense in which any contractual right can
be described as an asset, or indeed as property. In the present context, however,
what is important is that the contractual right is of such a kind that its breach can
result in an identifiable loss equivalent to the economic value of the right,
considered as an asset, even in the absence of any pecuniary losses which are
measurable in the ordinary way. That is something which is true of some
contractual rights, such as a right to control the use of land, intellectual property or
confidential information, but by no means of all. For example, the breach of a non-
compete obligation may cause the claimant to suffer pecuniary loss resulting from
the wrongful competition, such as a loss of profits and goodwill, which is
measurable by conventional means, but in the absence of such loss, it is difficult to
see how there could be any other loss.
94.
 
It is not easy to see how, in circumstances other than those of the kind
described in paras 91–93, a hypothetical release fee might be the measure of the
claimant’s loss. It would be going too far, however, to say that it is only in those
circumstances that evidence of a hypothetical release fee can be relevant to the
assessment of damages. If, for example, in other circumstances, the parties had
been negotiating the release of an obligation prior to its breach, the valuations
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
which the parties had placed on the release fee, adjusted if need be to reflect any
changes in circumstances, might be relevant to support, or to undermine, a
subsequent quantification of the losses claimed to have resulted from the breach.
It would be a matter for the judge to decide whether, in the particular
circumstances, evidence of a hypothetical release fee was relevant and, if so, what
weight to place upon it. However, the hypothetical release fee would not itself be a
quantification of the loss caused by a breach of contract, other than in
circumstances of the kind described in paras 91–93 above.
95.
 
The foregoing discussion leads to the following conclusions:
Damages assessed by reference to the value of the use wrongfully made of
property (sometimes termed ‘user damages’) are readily awarded at
common law for the invasion of rights to tangible moveable or immoveable
property (by detinue, conversion or trespass). The rationale of such awards
is that the person who makes wrongful use of property, where its use is
commercially valuable, prevents the owner from exercising a valuable right
to control its use, and should therefore compensate him for the loss of the
value of the exercise of that right. He takes something for nothing, for which
the owner was entitled to require payment.
Damages are also available on a similar basis for patent infringement and
breaches of other intellectual property rights.
Damages can be awarded under Lord Cairns’ Act in substitution for specific
performance or an injunction, where the court had jurisdiction to entertain
an application for such relief at the time when the proceedings were
commenced. Such damages are a monetary substitute for what is lost by
the withholding of such relief.
One possible method of quantifying damages under this head is on the
basis of the economic value of the right which the court has declined to
enforce, and which it has consequently rendered worthless. Such a
valuation can be arrived at by reference to the amount which the claimant
might reasonably have demanded as a quid pro quo for the relaxation of
the obligation in question. The rationale is that, since the withholding of
specific relief has the same practical effect as requiring the claimant to
permit the infringement of his rights, his loss can be measured by reference
to the economic value of such permission.
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)
(10)
That is not, however, the only approach to assessing damages under Lord
Cairns’ Act. It is for the court to judge what method of quantification, in the
circumstances of the case before it, will give a fair equivalent for what is lost
by the refusal of the injunction.
Common law damages for breach of contract are intended to compensate
the claimant for loss or damage resulting from the non-performance of the
obligation in question. They are therefore normally based on the difference
between the effect of performance and non-performance upon the
claimant’s situation.
Where damages are sought at common law for breach of contract, it is for
the claimant to establish that a loss has been incurred, in the sense that he
is in a less favourable situation, either economically or in some other
respect, than he would have been in if the contract had been performed.
Where the breach of a contractual obligation has caused the claimant to
suffer economic loss, that loss should be measured or estimated as
accurately and reliably as the nature of the case permits. The law is tolerant
of imprecision where the loss is incapable of precise measurement, and
there are also a variety of legal principles which can assist the claimant in
cases where there is a paucity of evidence.
Where the claimant’s interest in the performance of a contract is purely
economic, and he cannot establish that any economic loss has resulted
from its breach, the normal inference is that he has not suffered any loss. In
that event, he cannot be awarded more than nominal damages.
Negotiating damages can be awarded for breach of contract where the loss
suffered by the claimant is appropriately measured by reference to the
economic value of the right which has been breached, considered as an
asset. That may be the position where the breach of contract results in the
loss of a valuable asset created or protected by the right which was
infringed. The rationale is that the claimant has in substance been deprived
of a valuable asset, and his loss can therefore be measured by determining
the economic value of the right in question, considered as an asset. The
defendant has taken something for nothing, for which the claimant was
entitled to require payment.
(11)
(12)
Common law damages for breach of contract cannot be awarded merely for
the purpose of depriving the defendant of profits made as a result of the
breach, other than in exceptional circumstances, following 
Attorney General
v. 
Blake
.
Common law damages for breach of contract are not a matter of discretion.
They are claimed as of right, and they are awarded or refused on the basis
of legal principle. …
98. This is a case brought by a commercial entity whose only interest in the
defendants’ performance of their obligations under the covenants was commercial.
Indeed, a restrictive covenant which went beyond what was necessary for the
reasonable protection of the claimant’s commercial interests would have been
unenforceable. The substance of the claimant’s case is that it suffered financial
loss as a result of the defendants’ breach of contract. The effect of the breach of
contract was to expose the claimant’s business to competition which would
otherwise have been avoided. The natural result of that competition was a loss of
profits and possibly of goodwill. The loss is difficult to quantify, and some elements
of it may be inherently incapable of precise measurement. Nevertheless, it is a
familiar type of loss, for which damages are frequently awarded. It is possible to
quantify it in a conventional manner. …
99.
 
The case is not one where the breach of contract has resulted in the loss
of a valuable asset created or protected by the right which was infringed.
Considered in isolation, the first defendant’s breach of the confidentiality covenant
might have been considered to be of that character, but in reality the claimant’s
loss is the cumulative result of breaches of a number of obligations, of which the
non-compete and non-solicitation covenants have been treated as the most
significant. …
100.
 
The judge has ordered a hearing on quantum. That hearing should now
proceed, but it should not be, as he ordered, an assessment of the amount which
would notionally have been agreed between the parties, acting reasonably, as the
price for releasing the defendants from their obligations. The object of the exercise
is that the judge should measure, as accurately as he can on the available
evidence, the financial loss which the claimant has actually sustained. How that
assessment is best carried out is, in the first instance, a matter for the judge to
consider, proceeding in accordance with this judgment. If evidence is led in relation
to a hypothetical release fee, it is for the judge to determine its relevance and
weight, if any. It is important to understand, however, that such a fee is not itself
the measure of the claimant’s loss in a case of the present kind, for the reasons
which have been explained.
Lord Sumption
 
delivered a concurring judgment in which he stated that his
reasons ‘were not in all respects the same’ as those of Lord Reed but that their
conclusions appeared to him ‘to be closely aligned’. 
Lord Carnwath
 
gave a
judgment which agreed with the judgment of Lord Reed and which also sought to
examine the differences as he saw it between the judgment of Lord Reed and that
of Lord Sumption.
Commentary
The heart of Lord Reed’s judgment is to be found in his 12-point summary in paragraph
95. The importance of the summary extends beyond his analysis of the circumstances in
which a claimant may be entitled to recover negotiating damages. Thus he affirms (point
12) that damages for breach of contract are awarded as a matter of right, not discretion.
A claimant who brings an action for damages for breach of contract is thus asserting a
right, not seeking the discretionary assistance of the court. He also affirms that damages
for breach of contract are ‘intended to compensate the claimant for loss or damage’
(point 6) so that in the case where the claimant’s interest in the performance of the
contract is purely financial and it cannot prove that it has suffered loss as a result of the
defendant’s breach of contract, then in such a case the claimant ‘cannot be awarded
more than nominal damages’ (point 9). The focus of the claim for damages must
therefore ordinarily be on demonstrating that the claimant has suffered loss as a result
of the defendant’s breach of contract. While this may create difficulties for a claimant in
certain cases, the claimant must nevertheless maintain its focus on the identification of
the loss it claims that it has suffered and adduce before the court the best evidence it has
of that loss. In such a case, the court can be expected to be ‘tolerant of imprecision
where the loss is incapable of precise measurement’ (point 8), but the difficulty
experienced by the claimant in proving its loss does not of itself justify the court in
seeking to award damages on an entirely different basis, namely by reference to the
profit which the defendant has made from the breach. Instead, the court must do the
best it can on the evidence before it to identify and measure the loss which has been
suffered by the claimant.
Turning to the availability of negotiating damages, the critical points are points 1–5 and
10 of Lord Reed’s summary at paragraph 95. The two situations in which a claimant is
most likely to be able to recover ‘negotiating damages’ are where the defendant takes
and makes use of the claimant’s property without the claimant’s consent (the so-called
‘user damages’ cases referred to in point 1) and where the court exercises its jurisdiction
under section 50 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (a jurisdiction which previously existed
under what was known as Lord Cairns’ Act) to award the claimant damages in lieu of
specific performance or an injunction (see point 3).
It is important to note that Lord Reed viewed these claims as loss claims, not as claims
in which the claimant sought to recover the gain, or a share of the gain, made by the
defendant from its breach of contract. This was previously a point of contention, with
many commentators pointing out that there was no real loss in these cases and that
what the courts were really doing was to enable a claimant to recover a share of the
profit made by the defendant as a result of its breach of contract. The reason often given
for not analysing these claims as loss claims was that the claimant in many cases might
not have been willing to permit the defendant to breach its obligations, so that it was a
fiction to simulate a sale of the right as between a willing seller and a willing buyer. Lord
Reed addresses this point in paragraph 91 of his judgment, where he refers to an
‘imaginary negotiation’ between the parties. Nevertheless, he maintains that the claim is
best analysed as a loss claim, albeit he recognized at an earlier point in his judgment
that the notion of loss as it is used here differs from the conventional use of the word
loss. He explained the difference in its application to user damages (at [30]) in the
following terms:
In these cases, the courts have treated user damages as providing compensation for loss, albeit not loss of a
conventional kind. Where property is damaged, the loss suffered can be measured in terms of the cost of repair
or the diminution in value, and damages can be assessed accordingly. Where on the other hand an unlawful use
is made of property, and the right to control such use is a valuable asset, the owner suffers a loss of a different
kind, which calls for a different method of assessing damages. In such circumstances, the person who makes
wrongful use of the property prevents the owner from exercising his right to obtain the economic value of the
use in question, and should therefore compensate him for the consequent loss. Put shortly, he takes something
for nothing, for which the owner was entitled to require payment.
The circumstances in which Lord Reed expressly envisaged that negotiating damages
would be an appropriate remedy included (at [92]) the breach of a restrictive covenant
over land, the breach of an intellectual property agreement, or the breach of a
confidentiality agreement. These are likely to be the core cases in which negotiating
damages are awarded, but Lord Reed was careful not to rule out other potential
applications of the principle, albeit he stated that it was ‘not easy’ to see how negotiating
damages might be available in circumstances beyond those outlined in paragraphs 91–
93 of his judgment, although he does give a possible example of such a case in the latter
half of paragraph 94. The judgment of Lord Reed on the latter point is, however, not
entirely easy to decipher. The principal difficulty lies in discerning when for this purpose
a contractual right is to be viewed as ‘a valuable asset’ which can be protected by an
award of negotiating damages. It is clear from the opening sentence of paragraph 93
that Lord Reed did not regard each and every contractual right as an asset or as
property. But he does not tell us in clear terms which contractual rights will be viewed as
an asset and which will not. However, it may be that the problem is greater in theory
than in practice because the clear inference to be drawn from the speech of Lord Reed is
that the courts will be very slow to award negotiating damages in a breach of contract
case outside of the categories recognized in paragraphs 91–93, and that they are unlikely
to view a mere contractual right as a ‘valuable asset’ which requires to be protected by
the award of negotiating damages. Evidence for the latter proposition can be derived
from 
Priyanka Shipping Ltd
 
v. 
Glory Bulk Carriers Pty Ltd
 
[2019] EWHC 2804
(Comm), [2019] 1 WLR 6677, where the breach by a purchaser of a ship of a negative
covenant not to use a ship for 
any purpose other than demolition was held not to fall
within any of the categories recognized in 
Morris-Garner
 
so that negotiating damages
were not recoverable in respect of the purchaser’s subsequent use of the vessel. Although
the judge granted the seller an injunction to prohibit further use by the purchaser of the
vessel, this was of limited utility in relation to the purchaser’s use of the vessel prior to
the grant of the injunction, where the seller was confined to a claim for nominal
damages given that it was not entitled to recover negotiating damages and its pleaded
case did not establish that it had suffered recoverable financial loss as a result of the
purchaser’s breach of its undertaking.
Lord Sumption, in his concurring judgment, adopted a rather different approach. He
distinguished between three different categories of case. The first (at [110]–[111]) is
where damages are ‘not limited to pecuniary loss, because the claimant has an interest
in the observance of his rights which extends beyond financial reparation’. Cases in this
category include the invasion of property rights where the law treats the exclusive
dominion over the asset in question as having a pecuniary value independent of any
pecuniary detriment that he may have suffered by the breach of duty, so that the user-
rent is simply the measure of that value. Lord Sumption’s second category (at [112]–
[114]) consists of those cases ‘where the relevant obligation was in principle specifically
enforceable, and the release fee was the price of non-enforcement’. His third category (at
[115]–[122]) is the most difficult and consists of cases in which ‘the claimant has
suffered (or may be assumed to have suffered) pecuniary loss, and the notional release
fee is treated as evidence of that loss’. The paradigm case in this category was stated to
be the award of damages for patent infringement, but Lord Sumption did not confine
this category to ‘property rights’ traditionally so called, so that this category can extend
to ‘straightforward cases of breach of contract, where no question arose of the invasion
of proprietary rights’. There are clearly overlaps between the approach of Lord
Sumption and that adopted by Lord Reed (and Lord Carnwath attempted to sketch the
difference between the two approaches at [127]–[131], albeit Lord Reed at [101] declined
to make such a comparison on the ground that their judgments ‘speak for themselves’).
To the extent that there is a difference between the two approaches (and that of Lord
Sumption does appear to be broader than that of Lord Reed) it is the judgment of Lord
Reed that will prevail, given that it commanded the majority support of the court.
The final issue to note relates to the availability of an account of profits as a remedy for
breach of contract. An account of profits differs from negotiating damages in that an
account of profits aims to strip the defendant of the entirety of the profit which the
defendant has made from the breach of contract, while negotiating damages, as we have
seen, are now properly classified as loss claims. It is, however, true that negotiating
damages may operate in practice to reduce the profit which the defendant will make
from what would otherwise have been its breach of contract (in the sense that the
defendant will be required to pay a fee to the defendant and so reduce the profitability of
its proposed course of action). Nevertheless, negotiating damages differ from an account
of profits in that the latter have the effect of denying to the defendant the entirety of the
profit made from the breach, whereas negotiating damages will only deprive the
defendant of a share of that profit and the size of the share will depend on the outcome
of any hypothetical bargain constructed by the court.
Given that an account of profits aims to deprive the defendant of the entirety of its profit
from the breach of contract, it is a very powerful remedy. It could be said to be punitive
in effect but it does differ from punitive damages in that an account of profits cannot
exceed the profit made by the defendant from the breach, whereas there is no such
ceiling in the case of punitive damages. The exceptional nature of the remedy of an
account of profits 
was referred to by Lord Reed at point 11 in paragraph 95 of his
judgment. There he stated that, other than in ‘exceptional circumstances’, common law
damages for breach of contract cannot be awarded merely for the purpose of depriving
the defendant of profits made as a result of the breach of contract. The reference to
‘exceptional circumstances’ is to the controversial decision of the House of Lords in
Attorney General
 
v. 
Blake
 
[2001] 1 AC 268, where the Attorney-General was held to be
entitled to recover the entirety of the profits made by the spy, George Blake, from his
breach of contract in writing an autobiography and including within it information
which he had given an undertaking to the Crown that he would not divulge. Lord Reed
(at [64]–[82]) identified a number of difficulties with the speech of Lord Nicholls in
Blake
 
and stated that some of it was ‘not altogether easy to interpret’. But at the end of
the day the ‘soundness’ of 
Blake
 
was not in issue before the Supreme Court and so Lord
Reed contented himself by stating (at [82]) that ‘what 
Blake
 
decided was that in
exceptional circumstances an account of profits can be ordered as a remedy for breach
of contract’.
In 
Blake
 
itself the House of Lords sought to emphasize the exceptional nature of the
award which they were making. However, they did not find it easy to explain exactly why
the case was ‘exceptional’ nor is it easy to discern precisely when they envisaged that the
remedy would be available in subsequent cases. Lord Nicholls in 
Blake
 
did, however,
state that the remedy of an account of profits will be available only where other
contractual remedies are inadequate. Further, the claimant must generally have a
‘legitimate interest’ in preventing the defendant making or retaining its profit and, in
deciding whether or not to order an account of profits, a court must have regard to ‘all
the circumstances of the case’. However, in the light of the more sceptical approach
adopted by Lord Reed in 
Morris-Garner
, it is probably unlikely that courts in future
cases will award an account of profits where there has been a breach of an ordinary
commercial contract concluded between two commercial parties.
23.10
 
Punitive Damages
It was held by the House of Lords in 1909 that punitive damages cannot be recovered for
a breach of contract (
Addis
 
v. 
Gramophone Co Ltd
 
[1909] AC 488). This absolute ban on
the recovery of punitive damages for breach of contract is under some pressure as a
result of the decision of the House of Lords in 
Kuddus
 
v. 
Chief Constable of
Leicestershire Constabulary
 
[2001] UKHL 29, [2002] 2 AC 122, where it was held that,
in order to recover punitive damages, it is no longer necessary for a claimant in a tort
action to establish that punitive damages had been awarded in respect of that particular
cause of action prior to the decision of the House of Lords in 
Rookes
 
v.

AC 1129. Instead, the entitlement of a claimant to recover punitive damages in the future
is likely to turn on whether or not they fall within the two categories of case recognized
by Lord Devlin in 
Rookes
, namely oppressive, arbitrary, or unconstitutional action by
servants of the government and cases in which the defendant’s conduct has been
calculated by him to make a profit for himself which may well exceed the compensation
payable to the claimant. The scope of these categories may change slightly over time but
they are likely to form the foundation for the modern law.
There are two issues here for contract law. The first is whether or not the courts will take
the step of recognizing that a breach of contract can, in principle, give rise to a claim for
punitive damages (on which, see R Cunnington, ‘Should Punitive Damages be Part of the
Judicial Arsenal in Contract Cases?’ (2006) 26 
Legal Studies
 
369). The second issue
only arises if it is decided that the law should take the step of recognizing that punitive
damages can be recovered in a breach of contract claim; this issue relates to the
circumstances in which a claim for punitive damages should be available.
As to the first question, it is not at all obvious that the courts should take the step of
recognizing that the courts can award punitive damages for a breach of contract. Breach
of contract was never the subject of the arbitrary constraints imposed by 
Rookes
 
because
the source of the conclusion that punitive damages could not be recovered was not
Rookes
 
but the decision of the House of Lords back in 
Addis
. It was the product of a
considered decision, not the consequence of an arbitrary freezing of the law in 1964. On
this basis contract can be distinguished from other wrongs. It is also the case that the
introduction of punitive damages might require the re-consideration of other rules of
contract law, such as the rule which invalidates penalty clauses (on which see 
23.11
), the
restricted availability of specific performance, and the reluctance to view contractual
default as reprehensible or to regard the motive for breach as materially relevant (see S
Rowan, ‘Reflections on the Introduction of Punitive Damages for Breach of Contract’
(2010) 30 
OJLS
 
495). Nevertheless, the pressure to recognize that a breach of contract
can, in principle, give rise to a claim for punitive damages has not gone away. The
Supreme Court of Canada has recognized that punitive damages may be awarded in
respect of a breach of contract upon proof of an independent actionable wrong arising
out of the same facts as the breach (see 
Royal Bank of Canada
 
v. 
W Got & Associates
Electric Ltd
 
(2000) 178 DLR (4th) 385 and 
Whiten
 
v. 
Pilot Insurance Co
 
[2002] SCC 18
and, more generally, J Edelman, ‘Exemplary Damages for Breach of Contract’ (2001) 117
LQR
 
539). Will the English courts eventually reach this conclusion? They have not done
so yet (
Devenish Nutrition Ltd
 
v. 
Sanofi-Aventis SA
 
[2008] EWCA Civ 1086, [2009] Ch
390, [143]) but it may be that in time they will. As Lord Nicholls stated in 
A
 
v. 
Bottrill
[2002] UKPC 44, [2003] 1 AC 449, [26], in recognizing that punitive damages can, in
principle, be recovered in a case where the wrong committed by the defendant was
neither intentional nor reckless, ‘Never say never is a sound judicial admonition’. A
refusal to recognize that a breach of contract can give rise to punitive damages may
simply encourage claimants to characterize the breach as some other cause of action for
the purpose of seeking punitive damages. This subterfuge will bring little credit to the
law. The logic behind the abolition of the ‘cause of action’ test may eventually bring
down the rule that a breach of contract can never give rise to a claim for punitive
damages.
This leads us on to the second question. When will punitive damages be available in a
breach of contract case? The answer, it is suggested, will be ‘very rarely’. As both Lord
Nicholls and Lord Scott pointed out in 
Kuddus
 
(at [67] and [109] respectively), the effect
of 
Attorney-General
 
v. 
Blake
 
(to the extent that it remains good law, on which see 
23.9
)
may well be to undermine Lord Devlin’s second category in 
Rookes
 
on the basis that ‘the
profit made by a wrongdoer can be extracted from him without the need to rely on …
exemplary damages’ ([109]). This being the case, punitive damages are only likely to be
available where the breach of contract by the defendant is ‘so outrageous, his disregard
of the plaintiff’s rights so contumelious, that something more is needed to show that the
law will not tolerate such behaviour’ ([63]). Such cases are likely to be few and far
between. In particular, the mere fact that the defendant has broken his contract with the
claimant in order to pursue a more profitable relationship with another party will not
suffice to entitle the claimant to punitive damages. Much more will be required before a
finding can be made that a defendant has behaved in an ‘outrageous’ fashion.
23.11
 
Agreed Damages Clauses
It is open to contracting parties to make their own provision for the consequences of a
breach of contract. Thus they can insert into the contract a clause which quantifies, or
liquidates, the sum payable on the occurrence of a breach of contract. Lord Leggatt in
Triple Point Technology Inc
 
v. 
PTT Public Co Ltd
 
[2021] UKSC 29, [2021] 3 WLR 521,
[74] explained the function of such clauses as follows:
A liquidated damages clause is a clause in a contract which stipulates what amount of money will be payable as
damages for loss caused by a breach of the contract irrespective of what loss may actually be suffered if a breach
of the relevant kind (typically, delay in performance of the contract) occurs. Liquidated damages clauses are a
standard feature of major construction and engineering contracts and commonly provide for damages to be
payable at a specified rate for each week or day of delay in the completion of work by the contractor after the
contractual completion date has passed. Such a clause serves two useful purposes. First, establishing what
financial loss delay has caused the employer would often be an intractable task capable of giving rise to costly
disputes. Fixing in advance the damages payable for such delay avoids such difficulty and cost. Second, such a
clause limits the contractor’s exposure to liability of an otherwise unknown and open-ended kind, while at the
same time giving the employer certainty about the amount that it will be entitled to recover as compensation.
Each party is therefore better able to manage the risk of delay in the completion of the project.
These functions are clearly beneficial. But there are potential drawbacks, particularly
where the sum agreed by the parties is exorbitant. In order to guard against abuse, the
courts have reserved to themselves the power to regulate these clauses. If the term in the
contract making provision for the payment of damages is exorbitant and unconscionable
and is held to be a penalty clause, it will not be enforced and the innocent party will be
confined to a claim for damages for the recoverable loss which it can prove it has
suffered as a result of the breach. On the other hand, if the term is held to be a valid
agreed damages clause then it will fix the liability of the party in breach, in the sense
that the sum stipulated in the clause will be the sum that must be paid, irrespective of
the loss that is actually suffered on the facts of the case. It can be seen from this brief
description that the vital distinction is between a valid agreed damages clause (which is
enforceable) and a penalty clause (which is not). Although the distinction may seem easy
to state, it has proved to be difficult to draw in practice. As Lords Neuberger and
Sumption recently stated in 
Cavendish Square Holding BV
 
v. 
Talal El Makdessi
 
[2015]
UKSC 67, [2016] AC 1172, [3], the ‘penalty rule in England is an ancient, haphazardly
1.
2.
3.
4.
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
constructed edifice which has not weathered well’.
The rule was established principally by two important decisions of the House of Lords at
the beginning of the twentieth century, namely 
Clydebank Engineering and
Shipbuilding Co
 
v. 
Don Jose Yzquierdo y Castaneda
 
[1905] AC 6 and 
Dunlop
Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd
 
v. 
New Garage and Motor Co Ltd
 
[1915] AC 79. Indeed, the
speech of Lord Dunedin in the latter case achieved what Lords Neuberger and Sumption
referred to as ‘the status of a quasi-statutory code in the subsequent case law’
(
Cavendish Square Holding BV
 
at [22]). The core elements of Lord Dunedin’s speech
are to be found in the following passage:
Though the parties to a contract who use the words ‘penalty’ or ‘liquidated damages’ may prima facie be
supposed to mean what they say, yet the expression used is not 
conclusive. The Court must find out
whether the payment stipulated is in truth a penalty or liquidated damages. This doctrine may be said to
be found passim in nearly every case.
The essence of a penalty is a payment of money stipulated as in terrorem of the offending party; the
essence of liquidated damages is a genuine covenanted pre-estimate of damage (
Clydebank Engineering
and Shipbuilding Co
 
v. 
Don Jose Ramos Yzquierdo y Castaneda
 
[1905] AC 6).
The question whether a sum stipulated is penalty or liquidated damages is a question of construction to
be decided upon the terms and inherent circumstances of each particular contract, judged as at the time
of the making of the contract, not as at the time of the breach (
Public Works Commissioner
 
v. 
Hills
[1906] AC 368 and 
Webster
 
v. 
Bosanquet
 
[1912] AC 394).
To assist this task of construction various tests have been suggested, which if applicable to the case
under consideration may prove helpful, or even conclusive. Such are:
It will be held to be penalty if the sum stipulated for is extravagant and unconscionable in
amount in comparison with the greatest loss that could conceivably be proved to have followed
from the breach. (Illustration given by Lord Halsbury in the 
Clydebank Case
 
[1905] AC 6.)
It will be held to be a penalty if the breach consists only in not paying a sum of money, and the
sum stipulated is a sum greater than the sum which ought to have been paid (
Kemble
 
v. 
Farren
 
6
Bing 141). This though one of the most ancient instances is truly a corollary to the last test.
Whether it had its historical origin in the doctrine of the common law that when A. promised to
pay B. a sum of money on a certain day and did not do so, B. could only recover the sum with, in
certain cases, interest, but could never recover further damages for non-timeous payment, or
whether it was a survival of the time when equity reformed unconscionable bargains merely
because they were unconscionable,—a subject which much exercised Jessel MR in 
Wallis
 
v. 
Smith
21 Ch D 243—is probably more interesting than material.
There is a presumption (but no more) that it is penalty when ‘a single lump sum is made payable
by way of compensation, on the occurrence of one or more or all of several events, some of which
may occasion serious and others but trifling damage’ (Lord Watson in 
Lord Elphinstone
 
v.
Monkland Iron and Coal Co
 
11 App Cas 332).
On the other hand:
It is no obstacle to the sum stipulated being a genuine pre-estimate of damage, that the
consequences of the breach are such as to make precise pre-estimation almost an impossibility.
On the contrary, that is just the situation when it is probable that pre-estimated damage was the
true bargain between the parties (
Clydebank
 
Case [1905] AC 6, 11, Lord Halsbury; 
Webster
 
v.
Bosanquet
 
[1912] AC 394, 398, Lord Mersey).
In 
Cavendish Square Holding BV
 
Lords Neuberger and Sumption expressed the view
(at [22]) that this status as a ‘quasi-statutory code’ was ‘unfortunate’ and not what Lord
Dunedin had himself intended. Although Lord Dunedin’s speech has given rise to some
difficulty in subsequent case-law, the first and the third of his propositions have not
proved to be particularly controversial. The first proposition is that the parties’ choice of
label is relevant but not conclusive so that the courts can override the label used by the
parties if satisfied that it does not reflect the ‘true’ nature of the transaction that has
been concluded by the parties. The third 
proposition is that the court must focus
attention on the time of entry into the contract and not the time of breach, nor the date
of the hearing. This enables the parties to know where they stand in the sense that the
validity of the clause does not hinge upon future, unknown events. Thus the fact that,
with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that the figure chosen by the parties was
incorrect does not lead to the conclusion that the clause must be penal. It is the
intention of the parties at the moment of entry into the contract that is decisive.
Nevertheless, there may be cases in which the courts will have regard to events
subsequent to the making of the contract for the purpose of ascertaining the intended
scope of the clause. In 
Philips Hong Kong Ltd
 
v. 
Attorney-General of Hong Kong
 
(1993)
61 BLR 41 Lord Woolf stated (at p. 59) that what actually happened can ‘provide
valuable evidence as to what could reasonably be expected to be the loss at the time the
contract was made’.
By contrast, the second and the fourth propositions (the latter consisting of four sub-
propositions) have been more problematic. There are two problems with the second
proposition. The first is that it is not clear that the phrase ‘in terrorem’ is a helpful one
given that commercial parties are unlikely to be put in genuine fear as a result of the
appearance of an agreed damages clause in a contract. The second is that a clause may
be neither a ‘genuine covenanted pre-estimate of loss’ nor a clause ‘stipulated as in
terrorem of the offending party’. For example, the figure stipulated in the clause may be
higher than a pre-estimate of loss but not so high as to be ‘in terrorem’. In such a case, is
the clause a penalty clause or not?
The fourth proposition consists of a series of tests that, depending on the facts, ‘may
prove helpful, or even conclusive’. These tests work tolerably well in cases where the
parties enter into a contract with a view to obtaining a measurable financial return. In
such a case, if the stipulated sum significantly exceeds the anticipated financial return,
the clause is likely to be classified as a penalty. More difficult is the case where the
contract was not entered into with the object of obtaining an easily identifiable financial
return. An example in the latter category might be a public authority entering into a
contract for the improvement of the transport infrastructure in its region. In the event
that the contractor completes the works late, how is a court to assess the loss likely to be
suffered by the public authority and then ascertain whether the clause is a valid
liquidated damages clause or a penalty clause? A case of this type would appear to fall
within paragraph 4(d) of Lord Dunedin’s summary so that the parties should be given a
considerable degree of latitude in fixing the damages payable without falling foul of the
penalty rule (see, for example, 
Philips Hong Kong Ltd
 
v. 
Attorney-General of Hong
Kong
 
(1993) 61 BLR 41).
The difficulties involved in applying Lord Dunedin’s tests to ‘more complex cases’ (per
Lords Neuberger and Sumption in 
Cavendish Square Holding BV
 
at [22]) led some
judges to develop a different test in which the important question to be answered was
whether the clause was ‘commercially justifiable’ (see, for example, 
Lordsvale Finance
plc
 
v. 
Bank of Zambia
 
[1996] QB 752 and 
Murray
 
v. 
Leisureplay plc
 
[2005] EWCA Civ
963, [2005] IRLR 946). If the clause was ‘commercially justifiable’ then it was not a
penalty clause. The development of this test injected a greater degree of uncertainty into
the law. The lack of clarity as to the test to be applied led to questions about the scope of
the rule and indeed the justification for its very existence. These concerns were
addressed directly by the Supreme Court when it heard the conjoined appeals in
Cavendish Square Holding BV
 
v. 
Talal El Makdessi
 
and 
ParkingEye Ltd
 
v. 
Beavis
[2015] UKSC 67, [2016] AC 1172. In short the Supreme Court decided that the penalty
clause rule should neither be abolished nor extended but it recast the test to be applied
when seeking to distinguish a liquidated damages clause from a penalty clause.
We shall first consider the test which is to be applied by a court in order to differentiate
between a liquidated damages clause and a penalty clause before turning to discuss the
scope of the penalty rule and the justifications that have been given in support of its
continued existence.
The test to be applied when seeking to distinguish between a liquidated damage clause
and a penalty clause was variously described by the Supreme Court Justices in
Cavendish Square Holding BV
. Lords Neuberger and Sumption stated (at [31]–[32])
that:
[t]he real question when a contractual provision is challenged as a penalty is whether it is penal, not whether it
is a pre-estimate of loss. These are not natural opposites or mutually exclusive categories. A damages clause
may be neither or both. The fact that the clause is not a pre-estimate of loss does not therefore, at any rate
without more, mean that it is penal. To describe it as a deterrent (or, to use the Latin equivalent, 
in terrorem
)
does not add anything. A deterrent provision in a contract is simply one species of provision designed to
influence the conduct of the party potentially affected. It is no different in this respect from a contractual
inducement. Neither is it inherently penal or contrary to the policy of the law. The question whether it is
enforceable should depend on whether the means by which the contracting party’s conduct is to be influenced
are ‘unconscionable’ or (which will usually amount to the same thing) ‘extravagant’ by reference to some norm.
The true test is whether the impugned provision is a secondary obligation which imposes a detriment on the
contract-breaker out of all proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the enforcement of the
primary obligation. The innocent party can have no proper interest in simply punishing the defaulter. His
interest is in performance or in some appropriate alternative to performance. In the case of a straightforward
damages clause, that interest will rarely extend beyond compensation for the breach, and we therefore expect
that Lord Dunedin’s four tests would usually be perfectly adequate to determine its validity. But compensation
is not necessarily the only legitimate interest that the innocent party may have in the performance of the
defaulter’s primary obligations. This was recognised in the early days of the penalty rule, when it was still the
creature of equity, and … it is recognised in the more recent decisions about commercial justification.
Lord Mance sought to draw the distinction in the following terms (at [152]):
[T]he dichotomy between the compensatory and the penal is not exclusive. There may be interests beyond the
compensatory which justify the imposition on a party in breach of an additional financial burden. The
maintenance of a system of trade, which only functions if all trading partners adhere to it (
Dunlop
), may itself
be viewed in this light; so can terms of settlement which provide on default for payment of costs which a party
was prepared to forego if the settlement was honoured …; likewise, also the revision of financial terms to match
circumstances disclosed or brought about by a breach (
Lordsvale
 
and other cases). What is necessary in each
case is to consider, first, whether any (and if so what) legitimate business interest is served and protected by the
clause, and, second, whether, assuming such an interest to exist, the provision made for the interest is
nevertheless in the circumstances extravagant, exorbitant or unconscionable. In judging what is extravagant,
exorbitant or unconscionable, I consider (despite contrary expressions of view) that the extent to which the
parties were negotiating at arm’s length on the basis of legal advice and had every opportunity to appreciate
what they were agreeing must at least be a relevant factor.
Finally, Lord Hodge adopted the following test (at [255]):
I therefore conclude that the correct test for a penalty is whether the sum or remedy stipulated as a consequence
of a breach of contract is exorbitant or unconscionable when regard is had to the innocent party’s interest in the
performance of the contract. Where the test is to be applied to a clause fixing the level of damages to be paid on
breach, an extravagant disproportion between the stipulated sum and the highest level of damages that could
possibly arise from the breach would amount to a penalty and thus be unenforceable. In other circumstances
the contractual provision that applies on breach is measured against the interest of the innocent party which is
protected by the contract and the court asks whether the remedy is exorbitant or unconscionable.
It can be seen that there are common elements to these accounts of the test that is to be
applied by the court. The first is the emphasis on the need for the sum to be
‘extravagant’ or ‘unconscionable’ before the term will be held to be a penalty. This
strongly suggests that the standard of review is not particularly high. The reason for this
is that ‘the penalty rule is an interference with freedom of contract’ (
Cavendish Square
Holding BV
 
at [33]) and, as such, must be kept within narrow bounds. While the rule
‘does not normally depend for its operation on a finding that advantage was taken of one
party’, Lords Neuberger and Sumption pointed out (at [35]) that:
for all that, the circumstances in which the contract was made are not entirely irrelevant. In a negotiated
contract between properly advised parties of comparable bargaining power, the strong initial presumption must
be that the parties themselves are the best judges of what is legitimate in a provision dealing with the
consequences of breach. In that connection, it is worth noting that in 
Philips Hong Kong
 
at pp 57–59, Lord
Woolf specifically referred to the possibility of taking into account the fact that ‘one of the parties to the contract
is able to dominate the other as to the choice of the terms of a contract’ when deciding whether a damages
clause was a penalty. In doing so, he reflected the view expressed by Mason and Wilson JJ in [
AMEV-UDC
Finance Lyd
 
v. 
Austin
 
(1986) 162 CLR 170, 194] that the courts were thereby able to ‘strike a balance between
the competing interests of freedom of contract and protection of weak contracting parties’ (citing Atiyah, 
The
Rise and Fall of Freedom of Contract
 
(1979), 
Chapter 22
). However, Lord Woolf was rightly at pains to point
out that this did not mean that the courts could thereby adopt ‘some broader discretionary approach’.
On this basis, the rule should have relatively limited impact on contract terms agreed
between commercial parties who are of roughly equal bargaining power and have access
to skilled legal advice.
The second point to note is the reference to the ‘legitimate’ interests of the party seeking
to enforce the clause. In adopting this language the Supreme Court explicitly recognized
that the interest of a contracting party is not necessarily a financial one. Thus Lords
Neuberger and Sumption stated (at [28]) that:
[a] damages clause may properly be justified by some other consideration than the desire to recover
compensation for a breach. This must depend on whether the innocent party has a legitimate interest in
performance extending beyond the prospect of pecuniary compensation flowing directly from the breach in
question.
There are likely to be many cases where the only legitimate interest of a contracting
party is a financial one. As Lord Hodge observed (at [249]): ‘where the obligation which
has been breached is to pay money on a certain date, the innocent party’s interests are
normally fully served by the payment of the stipulated sum together with interest and
the costs of recovery.’ But in other cases the legitimate interest may extend beyond the
purely financial and, as Lord Mance observed (at [152]), encompass broader interests
such as the maintenance of its business systems or pricing structure (contrast 
Denka
Advantech Pte Ltd
 
v. 
Seraya Energy Pte Ltd
 
[2020] SGCA 119, [2021] BLR 340, [185]
where the Court of Appeal of Singapore held that the only legitimate interest with which
the penalty clause rule is concerned is that of compensation). While the identification of
a ‘legitimate’ interest may not always be straightforward, it is a standard that is used
elsewhere in the law of contract (see in particular the judgment of Lord Reid in 
White &
Carter (Councils) Ltd
 
v. 
McGregor
 
[1962] AC 413, 
22.6
) and it recognizes the reality
that parties do not enter into contracts with the sole aim of improving their financial
position.
Having identified the factors that the courts take into account in seeking to differentiate
between a liquidated damages clause and a penalty clause, what is the scope of the rule?
In other words, to what terms does the rule apply? The short answer is that it applies to
an obligation that is triggered by a breach of contract. The classic example is a sum of
money that is payable on a breach of contract. But it also encompasses an obligation to
transfer property on a breach of contract (
Cavendish Square Holding BV
 
at [16], [157]–
[159] and [230]), a term which permits the innocent party to withhold payments on a
breach (
Cavendish Square Holding BV
 
at [154]–[156] and [226]) and, potentially a
clause which requires a purchaser to pay an extravagant non-refundable deposit
(
Cavendish Square Holding BV
 
at [16] and [234]). The inclusion of clauses that entitle a
party to withhold money on breach raises the question of where the dividing line is to be
drawn between the penalty rule and the rules relating to relief against forfeiture. Lord
Hodge (at [227]) saw no difficulty in concluding that a clause could fall within both
rules. He stated:
There is no reason in principle why a contractual provision, which involves forfeiture of sums otherwise due,
should not be subjected to the rule against penalties, if the forfeiture is wholly disproportionate either to the
loss suffered by the innocent party or to another justifiable commercial interest which that party has sought to
protect by the clause. If the forfeiture is not so exorbitant and therefore is enforceable under the rule against
penalties, the court can then consider whether under English law it should grant equitable relief from forfeiture,
looking at the position of the parties after the breach and the circumstances in which the contract was broken.
This was the approach which Dillon LJ adopted in 
BICC plc
 
v. 
Burndy Corpn
 
[1985] Ch 232 and in which
Ackner LJ concurred. The court risks no confusion if it asks first whether, as a matter of construction, the clause
is a penalty and, if it answers that question in the negative, considers whether relief in equity should be granted
having regard to the position of the parties after the breach.
Lord Mance (at [160]–[161]), Lord Clarke (at [291]) and Lord Toulson (at [294])
reached the same conclusion on the latter point (Lords Neuberger and Sumption
reserved their opinion at [18]).
The common denominator in all of these cases is that the penalty clause rule only
applies in the context of a breach of contract. This has been established law in England
for many years (see, for example, 
Export Credit Guarantee Department
 
v. 
Universe Oil
Products Ltd
 
[1983] 1 WLR 399). On this basis the rule has no application to a sum that
is payable on an 
event which is not a breach of contract. The reasons for so confining the
penalty clause rule have long been open to question. Thus Lord Denning in 
Campbell
Discount Ltd
 
v. 
Bridge
 
[1962] AC 600, 629 observed that the insistence upon the need
for a breach means that equity commits itself to the ‘absurd paradox’ that it will protect
the party who breaks his contract but not the party who honestly admits his inability to
perform his obligations under the contract and exercises his contractual right to bring
the contract to an end. Further, the High Court of Australia in 
Andrews
 
v. 
Australia and
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd
 
(2012) 247 CLR 205, [2013] BLR 111 rejected this
‘breach limitation’ and held that, as a matter of Australian law, the penalty clause
jurisdiction is not confined to cases in which a sum of money is payable upon a breach of
contract. The Supreme Court considered such an extension of the penalty rule in
Cavendish Square Holding BV
 
but rejected it (as did the Court of Appeal of Singapore in
Denka Advantech Pte Ltd
 
v. 
Seraya Energy Pte Ltd
 
[2020] SGCA 119, [2021] BLR 340,
[185]). Lords Neuberger and Sumption stated (at [13]) that ‘there is a fundamental
difference between a jurisdiction to review the fairness of a contractual obligation and a
jurisdiction to regulate the remedy for its breach … The penalty rule regulates only the
remedies available for breach of a party’s primary obligations, not the primary
obligations themselves’ (see to similar effect Lord Mance at [130]). The difficulty the
‘breach limitation’ introduces is that it can be bypassed by clever drafting (see Lord
Mance at [130]) in that, while a secondary obligation providing a contractual alternative
to damages at law is within the rule, a conditional primary obligation is outside its scope
(see Lords Neuberger and Sumption at [14] and see also 
Vivienne Westwood Ltd
 
v.
Conduit Street Development Ltd
 
[2017] EWHC 350 (Ch)). This sharp distinction may
not be apparent to the uninitiated. However, there may be an escape route for such
parties. Lord Hodge (at [258]) stated that, in the case where the parties have
‘circumvented’ the rule but ‘the substance of the contractual arrangement is the
imposition of punishment for breach of contract, the concept of a disguised penalty may
enable a court to intervene’ (see also the reference to ‘the substance of the term and not
on its form or on the label which the parties have chosen to attach to it’ in the judgment
of Lords Neuberger and Sumption at [15]). In thus acknowledging the possibility of the
recognition of a ‘disguised penalty’ the Supreme Court may have opened up a means by
which the penalty rule can be extended in a way that may undermine certainty in
commercial transactions. The debate here would appear to be a classic ‘form and
substance’ debate. If the courts focus exclusively on the form of the clause, then a clause
which seeks to define or modify the primary obligations of the parties should be outside
the scope of the penalty clause rule. But a focus on the substance of the clause may lead
to a different conclusion given that the effect of a clause which defines or modifies a
primary obligation may be largely identical to a clause which makes provision for the
breach of a primary obligation. The difficulty which the courts have created for
themselves is that they have developed a test when seeking to determine the scope of the
penalty clause rule which is one of form (namely does the clause define the primary
obligations of the parties or does it impose a secondary obligation to pay damages upon
breach of a primary obligation?) but then they treat the question of form as if it were one
of substance when it comes to determining the potential scope of the penalty clause rule
(see 
Cavendish
 
at [15]). It is far from clear that this is a tenable position to adopt.
The final point to consider is why the Supreme Court did not take the step of abolishing
the penalty clause rule entirely. This was one of the submissions that was made to them,
but they rejected it for a number of reasons. First, the rule is ‘a long-standing principle
of English law’ ([37] and [162]). Secondly, it is a rule that is ‘common to almost all major
systems of law, at any rate in the western world’ ([37], [164]–[166], and [263]–[265]).
Thirdly, although 
statute has intervened to regulate many unfair contract terms,
‘statutory regulation is very far from covering the whole field’ ([38]). Fourthly, given the
incomplete statutory coverage, there is a need to retain the ability to regulate agreed
damages clauses given the ‘significant imbalances in negotiating power’ that continue to
exist in the commercial world ([262]). Fifthly, the limited nature of the rule has the
consequence that it does not prevent parties from ‘reaching sensible arrangements to fix
the consequences of a breach of contract and thus avoid expensive disputes’ ([266]).
Sixthly, to the extent that the rule was said to give rise to anomalies, these anomalies
were ‘better addressed’ by ‘a realistic appraisal of the substance of contractual
provisions operating upon breach’ and ‘by taking a more principled approach to the
interests that may properly be protected by the terms of the parties’ agreement’ ([39]).
Similarly, the submission that the penalty rule should no longer apply to commercial
transactions in which the parties were of equal bargaining power and each acted on
skilled legal advice was rejected because it would require the court to define what for
this purpose counts as a ‘commercial’ transaction, what amounts to ‘equal bargaining
power’ and ‘skilled legal advice’ ([168] and [267]). For the reasons given earlier, the rule
may not often strike down agreed damages clauses in such contracts, but such parties
are not exempt from the penalty rule. Thus the penalty rule continues to be a part of
English contract law so that, while contracting parties retain significant contractual
freedom in relation to the agreement of the sum that is payable in the event of a breach
of contract, the courts in turn have retained their historic jurisdiction to render
unenforceable a term which purports to make payable on a breach of contract a sum
which is extravagant, exorbitant, or unconscionable when regard is had to the innocent
party’s legitimate interest in the performance of the contract.
23.12
 
Deposits and Part Payments
Rather than include in the contract a provision to the effect that a particular sum is
payable on a breach of contract, the contract may provide that a sum of money is to be
paid up front and that it will not be returned in the event of a failure by the party making
the payment to perform his contractual obligations. One obvious advantage of this type
of clause is that it is not necessary to initiate legal proceedings in order to recover the
agreed sum because it is paid in advance. The onus is put on the party who has paid the
money to take steps to recover the prepayment. The entitlement of the party in breach to
recover his prepayment will depend upon the nature of the prepayment that has been
made. Where the money has been paid by way of a deposit, it is less likely to be
recoverable than in the case where it is a part payment of the contract price.
A deposit is a security and is generally irrecoverable, whereas a part payment is simply a
part payment of the price and is recoverable by the party in breach in the event of
termination of the contract. Whether a payment is made by way of deposit or part
payment of the price is a question of construction and, in cases of doubt, it will generally
be regarded as a part payment (
Dies
 
v. 
British and International Mining and Finance
Co
 
[1939] 1 KB 715).
The general rule is that a part payment is recoverable by the party in breach subject to
his liability in damages for the loss caused to the innocent party by his breach of
contract (see 
Dies
). However, the right of the party in breach to recover his prepayment
is not unqualified. In a case where it is clear from the contract that the payee will have to
incur reliance expenditure before completing his performance of the contract, then, in
the absence of a stipulation in the contract to the contrary, the part payment will
generally be irrecoverable (
Hyundai 
Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries Ltd
 
v.
Papadopoulos
 
[1980] 1 WLR 1129). Indeed, it may be the case that a prepayment is only
recoverable where the payer can demonstrate that it has been paid for a consideration
that has totally failed.
The general rule in relation to deposits is that they are not recoverable by the party in
breach. The function of a deposit is to serve as a security against a breach of contract
and so, were it to be recoverable upon a breach, it would defeat its function as a security.
The right of the recipient to retain the deposit is not, however, unqualified. The right of
a payee to retain a deposit was qualified by the Privy Council in the following case:
WORKERS TRUST AND MERCHANT BANK LTD V.
DOJAP INVESTMENTS LTD
[1993] AC 573, Privy Council
Vendors of property sought to forfeit a deposit of 25 per cent of the purchase price
when the purchaser failed to pay the balance of the purchase price within the
fourteen days stipulated in the contract, time being of the essence of the contract.
The purchasers did tender the balance of the purchase price with interest a week
later but the vendors returned the cheque and purported to forfeit the deposit of
almost Jamaican $3 million. The Privy Council held that the vendors were not
entitled to retain the deposit and ordered that it be repaid to the purchasers after
subtracting from it any loss which the vendors could prove they had suffered as a
result of the purchasers’ breach.
Lord Browne-Wilkinson
In general, a contractual provision which requires one party in the event of his
breach of the contract to pay or forfeit a sum of money to the other party is
unlawful as being a penalty, unless such provision can be justified as being a
payment of liquidated damages being a genuine pre-estimate of the loss which the
innocent party will incur by reason of the breach. One exception to this general rule
is the provision for the payment of a deposit by the purchaser on a contract for the
sale of land. Ancient law has established that the forfeiture of such a deposit
(customarily 10 per cent. of the contract price) does not fall within the general rule
and can be validly forfeited even though the amount of the deposit bears no
reference to the anticipated loss to the vendor flowing from the breach of contract.
This exception is anomalous and at least one textbook writer has been
surprised that the courts of equity ever countenanced it: see Farrand, 
Contract and
Conveyance
, 4th ed. (1983), p. 204. The special treatment afforded to such a
deposit derives from the ancient custom of providing an earnest for the
performance of a contract in the form of giving either some physical token of
earnest (such as a ring) or earnest money. The history of the law of deposits can
be traced to the Roman law of arra, and possibly further back still: see 
Howe
 
v.
Smith
 
(1884) 27 Ch D 89, 101–102, per Fry LJ. Ever since the decision in 
Howe
 
v.
Smith
, the nature of such a deposit has been settled in English law. Even in the
absence of express contractual provision, it is an earnest for the performance of
the contract: in the event of completion of the contract the deposit is applicable
towards payment of the purchase price; in the event of the purchaser’s failure to
complete in accordance with the terms of the contract, the deposit is forfeit, equity
having no power to relieve against such forfeiture.
However, the special treatment afforded to deposits is plainly capable of being
abused if the parties to a contract, by attaching the label ‘deposit’ to any penalty,
could escape the 
general rule which renders penalties unenforceable. There are
two authorities which indicate that this cannot be done. In 
Stockloser
 
v. 
Johnson
[1954] 1 QB 476, Denning LJ in considering the power of the court to relieve
against forfeiture said, obiter, at p. 491:
‘Again, suppose that a vendor of property, in lieu of the usual 10 per cent. deposit, stipulates for an initial
payment of 50 per cent. of the price as a deposit and part payment; and later, when the purchaser fails
to complete, the vendor resells the property at a profit and in addition claims to forfeit the 50 per cent.
deposit. Surely the court will relieve against the forfeiture. The vendor cannot forestall this equity by
describing an extravagant sum as a deposit, any more than he can recover a penalty by calling it
liquidated damages.’
In 
Linggi Plantations Ltd
 
v. 
Jagatheesan
 
[1972] 1 MLJ 89 Lord Hailsham of St
Marylebone LC delivered the judgment of the Board which upheld the claim to
forfeit a normal 10 per cent. deposit even though the vendor had in fact suffered no
loss. He referred on a number of occasions to a requirement that the amount of a
deposit should be ‘reasonable’ and said, at p. 94:
‘It is also no doubt possible that in a particular contract the parties may use language normally
appropriate to deposits properly so-called even to forfeiture which turn out on investigation to be purely
colourable and that in such a case the real nature of the transaction might turn out to be the imposition of
a penalty, by purporting to render forfeit something which is in truth part payment. This no doubt explains
why in some cases the irrecoverable nature of a deposit is qualified by the insertion of the adjective
“reasonable” before the noun. But the truth is that a reasonable deposit has always been regarded as a
guarantee of performance as well as a payment on account, and its forfeiture has never been regarded
as a penalty in English law or common English usage.’
In the view of their Lordships these passages accurately reflect the law. It is not
possible for the parties to attach the incidents of a deposit to the payment of a sum
of money unless such sum is reasonable as earnest money. The question
therefore is whether or not the deposit of 25 per cent. in this case was reasonable
as being in line with the traditional concept of earnest money or was in truth a
penalty intended to act in terrorem.
Zacca CJ tested the question of ‘reasonableness’ by reference to the evidence
before him that it was of common occurrence for banks in Jamaica selling property
at auction to demand deposits of between 15 per cent. and 50 per cent. He held
that, since this was a common practice, it was reasonable. Like the Court of
Appeal, their Lordships are unable to accept this reasoning. In order to be
reasonable a true deposit must be objectively operating as ‘earnest money’ and
not as a penalty. To allow the test of reasonableness to depend upon the practice
of one class of vendor, which exercises considerable financial muscle, would be to
allow them to evade the law against penalties by adopting practices of their own.
However although their Lordships are satisfied that the practice of a limited
class of vendors cannot determine the reasonableness of a deposit, it is more
difficult to define what the test should be. Since a true deposit may take effect as a
penalty, albeit one permitted by law, it is hard to draw a line between a reasonable,
permissible amount of penalty and an unreasonable, impermissible penalty. In their
Lordships’ view the correct approach is to start from the position that, without logic
but by long continued usage both in the United Kingdom and formerly in Jamaica,
the customary deposit has been 10 per cent. A vendor who seeks to obtain a larger
amount by way of forfeitable deposit must show special circumstances which
justify such a deposit.
[He considered the evidence advanced to support the validity of a deposit of 25
per cent and concluded]
Their Lordships agree with the Court of Appeal that this evidence falls far short
of showing that it was reasonable to stipulate for a forfeitable deposit of 25 per
cent. of the purchase price or indeed any deposit in excess of 10 per cent …
The question therefore arises whether the court has jurisdiction to relieve
against the express provision of the contract that the deposit of 25 per cent. was to
be forfeited. … In the view of their Lordships, since the 25 per cent. deposit was
not a true deposit by way of earnest, the provision for its forfeiture was a plain
penalty. There is clear authority that in a case of a sum paid by one party to
another under the contract as security for the performance of that contract, a
provision for its forfeiture in the event of non-performance is a penalty from which
the court will give relief by ordering repayment of the sum so paid, less any
damage actually proved to have been suffered as a result of non-completion:
Commissioner of Public Works
 
v. 
Hills
 
[1906] AC 368. Accordingly, there is
jurisdiction in the court to order repayment of the 25 per cent. deposit.
The Court of Appeal took a middle course by ordering the repayment of 15 per
cent. out of the 25 per cent. deposit, leaving the bank with its normal 10 per cent.
deposit which it was entitled to forfeit. Their Lordships are unable to agree that this
is the correct order. The bank has contracted for a deposit consisting of one
globular sum, being 25 per cent. of the purchase price. If a deposit of 25 per cent.
constitutes an unreasonable sum and is not therefore a true deposit, it must be
repaid as a whole. The bank has never stipulated for a reasonable deposit of 10
per cent.: therefore it has no right to such a limited payment. If it cannot establish
that the whole sum was truly a deposit, it has not contracted for a true deposit at
all.
Commentary
Three points should be noted about this decision. First, it may begin the process of
bringing the law relating to deposits closer to the law relating to liquidated damages
clauses (see, for example, 
UK Housing Alliance (North West) Ltd
 
v. 
Francis
 
[2010]
EWCA Civ 117, [2010] 3 All ER 519, [12], where Longmore LJ stated that the Privy
Council ‘applied the law on penalties since the sum was payable on breach’). However,
the rules are not yet identical. It cannot be said that a ‘reasonable’ deposit must be a
‘genuine pre-estimate of the loss’ (to the extent that this is still the test when considering
whether a clause is to be regarded as a penalty clause) but it would appear that a
genuine pre-estimate of the loss will be a reasonable deposit. The reason it cannot be
said that a deposit must be a genuine pre-estimate of the loss is that, in the case of
contracts for the sale of land, a 10 per cent deposit is reasonable even in the case where
it is not a genuine pre-estimate of the loss. The Supreme Court in 
Cavendish Square
Holding BV
 
v. 
Talal El Makdessi
 
[2015] UKSC 67, [2016] AC 1172, [16] and [234]
recognized that a clause which requires a purchaser to pay an extravagant non-
refundable deposit may fall within the scope of the penalty rule. But the Supreme Court
did not attempt fully to assimilate the penalty rule and the rules relating to relief against
forfeiture. Rather, they concluded that the penalty rule and the rule relating to relief
from forfeiture could be applied sequentially. In other words, the court should first ask
whether, as a matter of construction, the clause is a penalty and, if the answer to that
question is in the negative, it should ask whether (where relevant) relief against
forfeiture should be granted in equity having regard to the position of each of the parties
after the breach (see Lord Clarke at [291], Lord Toulson at [294], Lord Hodge at [227],
Lord Mance at [160]–[161]: Lords Neuberger and Sumption reserved their position on
this point at [18] but referred to 
Dojap
 
with approval at [16]).
The second point relates to the role of market practice in determining whether a deposit
is reasonable. In the case of the sale of land, market practice is a substantial factor in
support of the conclusion that a 10 per cent deposit is reasonable but market practice is
not determinative (as can be seen from the reluctance of the Privy Council to concede
that 25 per cent was a reasonable deposit because there was some evidence of a practice
of taking such a deposit). Thirdly, the case underlines the danger of asking for too big a
deposit. The court will not re-write the terms of the deposit. Instead it will strike down
an unreasonable deposit and relegate the claimant to a claim for damages. This being
the case, it is better to err on the side of caution. One view is to say that a party should
not ask for more than a genuine pre-estimate of his loss because, if he does so, he runs
the risk that the deposit will be unreasonable. If this is the case, the law relating to
liquidated damages clauses and deposits may be closer in substance than we are often
led to believe.

Specific Performance
Central Issues
Specific performance is a remedy which orders the defendant to
perform his obligations under the contract. It is an equitable remedy
which is available in the discretion of the court. Another equitable,
discretionary remedy is an injunction, which may be granted to
restrain a breach of a negative stipulation in a contract.
Traditionally, specific performance has been perceived as a secondary
remedy, only available where damages would be inadequate. This
restrictive perception of the role of specific performance has come
under challenge recently. An alternative perception of specific
performance is that it is available when it is the most appropriate
remedy on the facts of the case. One of the aims of this chapter is to
examine the circumstances in which the courts will make a specific
performance order. Particular attention will be paid to the decision of
the House of Lords in 
Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd
 
v. 
Argyll
Stores (Holdings) Ltd
 
[1998] AC 1.
Finally, the chapter concludes with a consideration of the question
whether English law should develop a more liberal approach to the
availability of specific performance and recognize the existence of a
general right to specific performance.
24.1
 
What is Specific Performance?
The term ‘specific performance’ in English law is used to denote ‘the remedy available in
equity to compel a person actually to perform a contractual obligation’ (H Beale (ed),
Chitty on Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021), para 30–017). This definition
requires qualification in two respects. In the first place it can be argued that specific
performance is not ‘specific’ at all in that, in the vast majority of cases, the defendant is
not ordered ‘specifically’ to perform a contractual obligation. The obligation that the
defendant is ordered to perform generally differs in some way from the initial obligation
that was undertaken in the contract. Most claimants do not seek specific performance
until the defendant has already 
broken the contract, although it is not strictly necessary
for a claimant seeking a specific performance order to demonstrate that the defendant
has already broken the terms of their contract. In such a case, the defendant obviously
cannot perform exactly in accordance with the original contractual obligation in that, at
the least, performance will take place at a different time from that originally agreed. On
this basis it can be argued that specific performance is a 
substitutionary
 
and not a
specific remedy. This point is not an unimportant one in that, if it is correct, it enables a
more direct comparison to be made with the damages remedy which clearly aims to
provide the claimant with a substitute (in the form of a monetary award) for the
performance originally promised. Secondly, not every action to compel a person to
perform a contractual obligation falls under the rubric of ‘specific performance’. Thus
where the obligation sought to be enforced is one to pay money, it is usually described as
an action for the price or a claim in debt, not a claim for specific performance. ‘Specific
performance’ is therefore used in a rather restricted sense in English law in comparison
with some civilian legal systems where, for example, the remedy of repair or
replacement of the goods is sometimes described as a form of specific performance.
In English law specific performance is an equitable remedy. The common law did not
specifically enforce a contract, except the obligation to pay money. The equitable origins
of the remedy continue to have an impact on the modern law. In the first place, specific
performance is a discretionary remedy. It is not available as of right, unlike the action
for damages at common law. However, it does not follow from this that one can never
predict when specific performance will be ordered by the courts. There are ‘well-
established principles’ that govern the exercise of the court’s discretion (see, for
example, the speech of Lord Hoffmann in 
Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd
 
v. 
Argyll
Stores (Holdings) Ltd
 
[1998] AC 1, 24.4). Thus one can find situations where specific
performance is either routinely available (for example, in favour of a purchaser under a
contract for the sale of land) or generally unavailable (for example, contracts for
‘personal services’, on which see 
24.3.1
). The discretion is therefore a structured one.
However, in the final analysis, the remedy lies in the discretion of the court and it is
always necessary to pay careful attention to the facts and circumstances of the individual
case. Secondly, the courts have had to work out the relationship between the equitable
remedy of specific performance and the common law remedies. The traditional formula
used by the courts is that ‘specific performance will not be ordered when damages are an
adequate remedy’. This formula requires further elaboration.
24.2
 
Specific Performance and the
Adequacy of Damages
The statement that specific performance will not be ordered when damages are an
adequate remedy prompts two questions. First, when are damages an adequate remedy?
Second, must a court refuse to make a specific performance order where damages are an
adequate remedy?
The courts tend not to answer the first question directly; that is to say they do not spell
out the circumstances in which damages are an adequate remedy. Rather, they identify
the circumstances in which damages are inadequate. Damages may be inadequate where
the loss which the claimant has suffered is either difficult to quantify or to prove
(
Adderley
 
v. 
Dixon
 
(1824) 1 Sim & St 607) or where the claimant is only entitled to
recover nominal damages in respect of the defendant’s breach (as in 
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswick
[1968] AC 58, discussed at 
25.3.2.1
). The case that is usually cited by way of illustration
of the ‘inadequacy of damages’ 
rule is the case of the contract for the sale of unique
goods. The contract in 
Falcke
 
v. 
Gray
 
(1859) 4 Drew 651 was for the sale of two china
jars. Although the court refused to make a specific performance order on the facts of the
case, the Vice-Chancellor stated that:
[i]n the present case the contract is for the purchase of articles of unusual beauty, rarity and distinction, so that
damages would not be an adequate compensation for non-performance; and I am of opinion that a contract for
articles of such description is such a contract as this Court will enforce; and, in the absence of all other
objection, I should have no hesitation in decreeing specific performance.
It is an unresolved question whether uniqueness includes goods that are commercially
unique, in the sense that there are no other goods with the same characteristics available
in the market. Support for the proposition that ‘uniqueness’ encompasses commercial
uniqueness can be gleaned from 
Behnke
 
v. 
Bede Shipping Co Ltd
 
[1927] 1 KB 649. The
plaintiffs sought an order for specific performance of a contract for the purchase of a
ship named 
City
. Wright J made the order sought. He stated (at p. 661):
In the present case there is evidence that the 
City
 
was of peculiar and practically unique value to the plaintiff.
She was a cheap vessel, being old, having been built in 1892, but her engines and boilers were practically new
and such as to satisfy the German regulations, and hence the plaintiff could, as a German shipowner, have her
at once put on the German register. A very experienced ship valuer has said that he knew of only one other
comparable ship, but that may now have been sold. The plaintiff wants the ship for immediate use, and I do not
think damages would be an adequate compensation. I think he is entitled to the ship and a decree of specific
performance in order that justice may be done.
A different result was, however, reached in 
Société des Industries Metallurgiques SA
 
v.
The Bronx Engineering Co Ltd
 
[1975] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 465, where the Court of Appeal held
that the fact that the buyers would have to wait between nine and twelve months for a
replacement delivery did not of itself establish that the goods were unique. Lord
Edmund Davies quoted from the judgment of Wright J in 
Behnke
 
and continued (at p.
468):
By way of contrast with that case, the real substance of the plaintiffs’ claim here is that were they now obliged to
go to another manufacturer they would probably have to wait another 9–12 months before they could get
delivery of such new machinery and that, by reason of that delay and other factors, they would stand to lose a
substantial sum. There has been no suggestion of financial inability in the defendants to satisfy such a money
judgment (whatever its dimensions) as might be awarded against them to cover all such items of damages as the
plaintiffs could legitimately rely upon. While sympathising with the dilemma in which the plaintiffs find
themselves, I see nothing which removes this case from the ordinary run of cases arising out of commercial
contracts where damages are claimed.
The reason for making a specific performance order in cases such as 
Behnke
 
is that the
lack of an available substitute makes it extremely difficult for a court to assess the
damages payable with any degree of accuracy and these problems of assessment can be
avoided by making a specific performance order. On the other hand, damages are likely
to be an adequate remedy where the claimant can obtain the promised performance
from another source and then 
recover the difference in the cost of the alternative
performance from the defaulting party. It is important to note that the fact that damages
are inadequate does not of itself entitle the claimant to a specific performance order. A
court may nevertheless, in its discretion, refuse to make such an order. On this view
inadequacy of damages is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the making of a
specific performance order.
The proposition that inadequacy of damages is a necessary condition for the making of a
specific performance order has, however, come under some challenge in recent years.
That challenge was led by the House of Lords in 
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswick
 
[1968] AC 58 (see
25.3.2.1
) where emphasis was placed on the appropriateness of specific performance on
the facts of the case or the justice of making the order rather than on the inadequacy of
the damages remedy (see to similar effect 
Tito
 
v. 
Waddell (No 2)
 
[1977] Ch 106, 322).
This was most explicit in the speech of Lord Pearce. He alone of the judges was of the
view that the plaintiff was entitled to substantial damages but he stated (at p. 88) that it
was not ‘necessary to consider the amount of damages more closely, since this is a case
in which … the more appropriate remedy is that of specific performance’. The point
being made by Lord Pearce is not that the adequacy, or inadequacy, of the damages
remedy should be disregarded entirely. Rather, it is that it should remain a relevant
factor but that it should no longer be a necessary ingredient of a claim for specific
performance. Disquiet with the traditional ‘adequacy of damages’ formula is based on a
number of grounds. The first is that a claimant, as the innocent party, should be entitled
to choose the remedy that is most appropriate on the facts of the case and should not
have his choice constrained by an unnecessary restriction. Secondly, a claimant runs an
inevitable risk in arguing that the damages to which he is otherwise entitled are
inadequate. Should the court in its discretion decide not to make the specific
performance order, then he will be left with a measure of damages which, by his own
admission, is inadequate. A claimant should not be put in the position of having to make
the potentially damaging concession that damages are inadequate in order to
substantiate his claim to a completely different remedy, namely specific performance.
Thirdly, to the extent that the courts continue to develop the remedy of damages in
order to further the goal of ensuring that claimants receive full compensation for the
losses suffered as a result of a breach of contract (on which see 
23.3
), this will result, on
the traditional formula, in a reduction in the availability of specific performance because
claimants will find it increasingly difficult to demonstrate that damages are an
inadequate remedy. Reform of the law of damages should not carry with it, as a
necessary by-product, a reduction in the availability of specific performance.
The law is therefore in a state of flux. The judges are no longer confined to asking
themselves whether or not damages would be an adequate remedy on the facts of the
case. They can take account of a broader range of factors when deciding whether or not
to make a specific performance order (see the summary of factors given by Akenhead J
in 
Transport for Greater Manchester
 
v. 
Thales Transport & Security Ltd
 
[2012] EWHC
3717 (TCC), 146 Con LR 194, [17]). The adequacy of damages to the claimant remains a
very important factor in making this decision but it should no longer be regarded as
decisive. Nevertheless, in the vast majority of cases, one would not expect a court to
make a specific performance order where damages would be an adequate remedy for the
claimant. In this respect it may be said that the modern emphasis on the
‘appropriateness’ of the remedy on the facts of the case is no more than a change of
label. Thus in 
Rainbow Estates Ltd
 
v. 
Tokenhold Ltd
 
[1998] 2 All ER 860, 868
Lawrence Collins QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, stated that ‘the remedy
should be available when damages are not an adequate remedy or, in the more modern
formulation, when specific performance is the appropriate remedy’. But it would
perhaps be premature to write this change off as one that is devoid of substance. It
widens 
the field of inquiry and it relieves the claimant of the need positively to establish
that damages would not be an adequate remedy (albeit that the adequacy of damages
remains an important factor in deciding whether or not to make the specific
performance order).
24.3
 
The Range of Factors to Which the
Courts Will Have Regard
The proposition that specific performance should be available when damages are not an
adequate remedy or when it is the most appropriate remedy on the facts of the case does
not, however, tell the whole story. The cases reveal that there are a number of
circumstances in which the courts will refuse to make a specific performance order. The
weight to be attached to these different ‘circumstances’ is variable. Some weigh much
more heavily on the scales than others and are sometimes described as ‘bars to specific
performance’. Thus, while acknowledging that there are exceptions of varying scope in
each case, Treitel states (
The Law of Contract
 
(15th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited
by Edwin Peel), paras 21–039–21–053) that the following are not specifically
enforceable, namely (i) contracts involving personal service, (ii) contracts requiring
constant supervision, (iii) contracts which are too vague, (iv) building contracts, (v)
contracts specifically enforceable in part only, (vi) a contract which the defendant is
entitled to terminate in any event or which is subject to a condition precedent not within
the control of the party seeking specific performance, and (vii) promises made without
consideration. Treitel also lists the following as factors that are taken into account by the
courts in the exercise of their discretion when deciding not to make a specific
performance order, namely (i) the order would cause ‘severe hardship to the defendant’;
(ii) the contract has been procured ‘by means that are unfair, even though they do not
amount to grounds on which the contract can be invalidated’; (iii) the consideration for
the defendant’s promise to perform is inadequate (although Treitel concedes at para 21–
034 that the legitimacy of taking this factor into account is now doubtful given that it is
clear that ‘
mere
 
inadequacy of consideration is not a ground for refusing specific
performance’); (iv) the conduct of the claimant, in the sense that if the claimant has
himself acted unfairly or improperly this may be used as a basis for denying the remedy
on the ground that the claimant has not come to court ‘with clean hands’; and (v) the
fact that it is impossible for the defendant to comply with the terms of the order. This
list of factors does not purport to be exhaustive and, indeed, other authors have drawn
up a list in slightly different terms (see, for example, A Burrows, 
Remedies for Torts,
Breach of Contract, and Equitable Wrongs
 
(4th edn, Oxford University Press, 2019) pp.
(a)
(b)
402–436). For present purposes these differences can be put to one side; they are
largely matters of detail into which it is not necessary for us to enter. The list performs
the function of indicating, in broad terms, the range of factors taken into consideration
by the courts when deciding whether or not to make a specific performance order.
The more difficult points relate to, first, the weight to be given to some of the factors that
have been relied upon in the past to justify a decision not to order specific performance
and, secondly, the scope of some of the acknowledged ‘bars’ to specific performance. The
cause of these difficulties is that some of the bars are of some antiquity and they are, to
modern eyes, reflective of an unduly restrictive approach to the availability of specific
performance. In order to illustrate this point we shall examine three of the grounds on
which the courts have refused to order specific performance. In the first two instances
(namely, personal service contracts and mutuality) we can see the courts gradually
cutting back on the scope of the 
bar to specific performance. The third example, namely
hardship to the defendant, demonstrates that this more liberal approach is not without
its limits and that the courts continue to take account of the interests of defendants
when deciding whether or not it is appropriate to make a specific performance order.
We shall then move on in the next section to consider the leading modern authority on
specific performance, namely the decision of the House of Lords in 
Co-operative
Insurance Society Ltd
 
v. 
Argyll Stores (Holdings) Ltd
 
[1998] AC 1.
24.3.1
 
Personal Service Contracts
A contract involving personal service (for example, a contract of employment) will not
generally be specifically enforced. Thus section 236 of the Trade Union and Labour
Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 provides:
No court shall, whether by way of—
an order of specific performance or specific implement of a contract of employment, or
an injunction or interdict restraining a breach or threatened breach of such a contract, compel an
employee to do any work or attend at any place for the doing of any work.
It should be noted that section 236 applies both to specific performance orders and to
injunctions, although, as we shall see, the courts have, in fact, been willing in certain
cases to grant an injunction, the effect of which is to restrain the employer from
terminating the contract of employment with the claimant employee. In so far as the law
wishes to avoid turning a contract of employment into a form of slavery, the proposition
that the courts should not make a specific performance order or grant an injunction is
readily understandable (see, for example, 
De Francesco
 
v. 
Barnum
 
(1890) 45 Ch D 430,
438). And, from an employer’s perspective, one can see that an employer may well wish
not to continue to employ a worker in whom he no longer has any trust and confidence.
But it does not follow from this that the courts should never have the power at common
law to order the continued performance of a contract of employment. As Lord Hoffmann
acknowledged in 
Johnson
 
v. 
Unisys Ltd
 
[2001] UKHL 13, [2003] 1 AC 518, [35], it is
now recognized that ‘a person’s employment is usually one of the most important things
in his or her life. It gives not only a livelihood but an occupation, an identity and a sense
of self-esteem.’ Consistently with this, the unfair dismissal legislation, first introduced in
1971, provides for the remedies of reinstatement and re-engagement (see now sections
113–117 of the Employment Rights Act 1996) as well as compensation. This commitment
in principle to reinstatement as a remedy has not, however, been reflected in practice.
As Lord Steyn observed in 
Johnson
 
([23]), the level of reinstatement may be as low as 3
per cent of all unfair dismissal applicants. The reasons for the low take-up of
reinstatement are complex. Many employees prefer to be compensated rather than be
faced with the prospect of returning to their old place of work; employment tribunals
appear to be reluctant to make use of the remedy; and an employer can ultimately resist
a reinstatement order provided that it is prepared to pay an enhanced level of
compensation (section 117 of the Employment Rights Act 1996). Of course, it does not
follow from the fact that employment tribunals have been given a statutory power to
order reinstatement that the courts should have such a power at common law. On the
contrary, section 236 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992
states that they have no such power.
However, one can find modern examples of cases in which the courts have been
prepared to grant an injunction, the effect of which was to restrain the employer from
terminating the contract of employment with the employee. One such case is 
Irani
 
v.
Southampton and South West Hampshire Health Authority
 
[1985] ICR 590. The
defendant employer purported to terminate the plaintiff’s contract of employment in
breach of a statutory appeal procedure that was applicable to the plaintiff. The plaintiff
sought, and obtained, an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant from
terminating his contract of employment without first exhausting the procedure laid
down in section 33 of the Whitley Council’s Conditions of Service. It is, however,
important to note the terms of the injunction proposed by Warner J, namely:
Injunction restraining defendant until trial or further order from implementing notice dated 8 June 1984
purporting to determine plaintiff’s employment with defendant as from 23 July 1984 before carrying out
procedure under section 33 of Whitley Council’s Conditions of Service.
Plaintiff undertaking not to present himself for work at any establishment of defendant’s pending trial.
An important feature of this injunction is that it refrains from ordering the defendant to
provide the plaintiff with work. On the contrary, the plaintiff expressly undertook not to
turn up for work. The plaintiff was protected in so far as his status as an employee was
preserved and the employer remained liable to pay his salary, but he could not compel
the employer to provide him with work (see also 
Robb
 
v. 
Hammersmith and Fulham
LBC
 
[1991] ICR 514, where the terms of the injunction were similarly limited). The
limited nature of the injunction granted may simply reflect the reality that the law
should be slow to require parties to co-operate with each other in the face of evidence
that the trust and confidence which once existed between them has evaporated.
Conversely, where it appears that the relationship of trust and confidence continues to
subsist between the employer and the employee, the court may not require the employee
to give an undertaking that he will not present himself for work: see, for example, 
Hill
 
v.
C A Parsons Ltd
 
[1972] Ch 305, where the cause of the dismissal was the intervention of
a trade union and the relationship between the employer and employee appeared to
remain a strong one.
Thus we can conclude from cases such as 
Irani
, 
Robb
, and 
Hill
 
that there is no longer an
absolute bar to a court granting an injunction to restrain the termination of an
employment relationship, at least where the party seeking the injunction is an employee.
Further evidence in support of the existence of a more liberal approach can be gleaned
from the expansion of public law remedies which has enabled a number of workers to
obtain judicial review of the decision to dismiss them (see, for example, 
Stevenson
 
v.
United Road Transport Union
 
[1977] ICR 893).
In the light of these cases it may now be appropriate to reconsider the justifications for
the proposition that the courts should not specifically enforce a contract for personal
services. The case for (limited) reform was best put by Megarry J in 
C H Giles & Co Ltd
v. 
Morris
 
[1972] 1 WLR 307, 318 when he stated:
One day, perhaps, the courts will look again at the so-called rule that contracts for personal services or involving
the continuous performance of services will not be specifically enforced. Such a rule is plainly not absolute and
without exception, nor do I think that it can be 
based on any narrow consideration such as difficulties of
constant superintendence by the court. Mandatory injunctions are by no means unknown, and there is normally
no question of the court having to send its officers to supervise the performance of the order of the court.
Prohibitory injunctions are common, and again there is no direct supervision by the court. Performance of each
type of injunction is normally secured by the realisation of the person enjoined that he is liable to be punished
for contempt if evidence of his disobedience to the order is put before the court; and if the injunction is
prohibitory, actual committal will usually, so long as it continues, make disobedience impossible. If instead the
order is for specific performance of a contract for personal services, a similar machinery of enforcement could
be employed, again without there being any question of supervision by any officer of the court. The reasons why
the court is reluctant to decree specific performance of a contract for personal services (and I would regard it as
a strong reluctance rather than a rule) are, I think, more complex and more firmly bottomed on human nature.
If a singer contracts to sing, there could no doubt be proceedings for committal if, ordered to sing, the singer
remained obstinately dumb. But if instead the singer sang flat, or sharp, or too fast, or too slowly, or too loudly,
or too quietly, or resorted to a dozen of the manifestations of temperament traditionally associated with some
singers, the threat of committal would reveal itself as a most unsatisfactory weapon; for who could say whether
the imperfections of performance were natural or self-induced? To make an order with such possibilities of
evasion would be vain; and so the order will not be made. However, not all contracts of personal service or for
the continuous performance of services are as dependent as this on matters of opinion and judgment, nor do all
such contracts involve the same degree of the daily impact of person on person. In general, no doubt, the
inconvenience and mischief of decreeing specific performance of most of such contracts will greatly outweigh
the advantages and specific performance will be refused. But I do not think that it should be assumed that as
soon as any element of personal service or continuous services can be discerned in a contract the court will,
without more, refuse specific performance.
24.3.2
 
Mutuality
Sir Edward Fry, in the first edition of his book 
Specific Performance
 
published in 1858,
stated that:
A contract to be specifically enforced by the Court must, as a general rule, be mutual,—that is to say, such that it
might, at the time it was entered into, have been enforced by either of the parties against the other of them.
This proposition was subject to much academic criticism but it did not receive sustained
judicial consideration until 1977 in the form of the decision of the Court of Appeal in
Price
 
v. 
Strange
 
[1978] Ch 337. A number of criticisms were levelled against Fry’s
proposition, of which it suffices to mention two. The first was that it was not supported
by the cases cited by Fry, and the cases also demonstrated that there were a number of
exceptions to the rule. Secondly, it was argued that the focus of attention should not be
on the time at which the contract was concluded but on the position of the parties at the
time of judgment. At the time at which it gives judgment the court ought to consider the
relative positions of the parties; and, to the extent that there are obligations of the
claimant that remain unperformed, 
the court should consider the remedies available to
the defendant to ensure that it is adequately compensated in the event of non-
performance by the claimant. In the light of these criticisms Buckley LJ in 
Price
 
v.
Strange
 
[1978] Ch 337, 367–368 concluded:
I can discover nothing in principle to recommend the 
Fry
 
proposition, and authority seems to me to be strongly
against it. Accordingly in my judgment it should be regarded as wrong. The time at which the mutual
availability of specific performance and its importance must be considered is, in my opinion, the time of
judgment, and the principle to be applied can I think be stated simply as follows: the court will not compel a
defendant to perform his obligations specifically if it cannot at the same time ensure that any unperformed
obligations of the plaintiff will be specifically performed, unless, perhaps, damages would not be an adequate
remedy to the defendant for any default on the plaintiff’s part.
Subsequent courts have followed the lead given by Buckley LJ. In 
Rainbow Estates Ltd
v. 
Tokenhold Ltd
 
[1998] 2 All ER 860, 865–866 Lawrence Collins QC, stated that:
as regards the requirement of mutuality, it is now clear that it does not follow from the fact that specific
performance is not available to one party that it is not available to the other; want of mutuality is a
discretionary, and not an absolute, bar to specific performance. The court will grant specific performance if it
can be done without injustice or unfairness to the defendant.
The importance of the judgment of Lawrence Collins QC lies in its recognition of the fact
that want of mutuality is no longer, if it ever was, an absolute bar to making a specific
performance order; it is simply a factor to be taken into account by the court in the
exercise of its discretion. The modern position is perhaps best summed up (
Anson’s Law
of Contract
 
(31st edn, Oxford University Press, 2020, edited by J Beatson, A Burrows,
and J Cartwright), p. 581) in the following way:
[L]ack of mutuality is now only relevant if, at the date of the hearing, the claimant has not performed its
obligations under the contract and could not be compelled for some reason to perform its unperformed
obligations specifically. Even where mutuality in this sense does not exist, the Court may possibly, in the
exercise of its discretion, order specific performance if damages would be an adequate remedy to the defendant
for any default on the claimant’s part.
24.3.3
 
Undue Hardship
A court may refuse to make a specific performance order on the ground that it will cause
severe hardship to the defendant. The difficulty which the courts face here lies in
discerning what constitutes ‘severe hardship’ for this purpose. The hardship need not be
of sufficient severity to entitle the defendant to set aside the contract (in such a case the
defendant could attack the validity of the contract rather than merely rely on a defence
to the application for specific performance). But how far below the threshold for the
validity of a contract can the court go? It is impossible to produce a hard-and-fast rule
here. Much depends on the facts of the individual case. An illustration of a court
considering a defence based on hardship is provided by the decision of Goulding J in
Patel
 
v. 
Ali
 
[1984] Ch 283. The defendant and a 
Mr Ahmed entered into a contract to sell
the defendant’s matrimonial home to the plaintiffs (the property was registered in the
name of Mr Ahmed). The contract was concluded in July 1979, with a completion date of
28 August 1979. Completion did not, however, take place on 28 August. The plaintiff
issued a writ seeking specific performance of the contract on 11 August 1980 but did not
apply for summary judgment until 4 July 1983. The reasons for the delay were not
conclusively established, but appeared to be caused by two principal factors. The first
was that the defendant’s husband had been adjudicated bankrupt in May 1979 and his
trustee in bankruptcy succeeded in obtaining an injunction restraining completion of
the sale. Her husband was not released from that injunction until 21 July 1980.
Secondly, the plaintiffs had difficulty in effecting service of proceedings on Mr Ahmed,
as he had returned to Pakistan. However, in this intervening period the defendant
suffered considerable misfortune. In July 1979 she was 23 years old, had one child, was
in apparent good health, and spoke very little English. But in 1980 it was discovered that
she had bone cancer in her right thigh which led to the amputation of her right leg at the
hip joint in July of that year. At that time she was heavily pregnant and she gave birth to
her second child in August 1980. Then in 1981 her husband was sent to prison for a year
and she gave birth to her third child in 1983, after her husband’s release from prison. In
these circumstances the defendant asked the court to refuse the plaintiffs’ application
for specific performance and to leave the plaintiffs to their remedy in damages. After
considering the authorities Goulding J concluded that his discretion was wide enough to
entitle him to refuse to make a specific performance order on the ground of ‘hardship
subsequent to the contract and not caused by the plaintiff’. He acknowledged that ‘mere
pecuniary difficulties … afford no excuse from performance of a contract’ and continued
(at p. 288):
The important and true principle, in my view, is that only in extraordinary and persuasive circumstances can
hardship supply an excuse for resisting performance of a contract for the sale of immovable property. A person
of full capacity who sells or buys a house takes the risk of hardship to himself and his dependants, whether
arising from existing facts or unexpectedly supervening in the interval before completion. This is where, to my
mind, great importance attaches to the immense delay in the present case, not attributable to the defendant’s
conduct. Even after issue of the writ, she could not complete, if she had wanted to, without the concurrence of
the absent Mr Ahmed. Thus, in a sense, she can say she is being asked to do what she had never bargained for,
namely to complete the sale after more than four years, after all the unforeseeable changes that such a period
entails. I think that in this way she can fairly assert that specific performance would inflict on her a ‘hardship
amounting to injustice’ to use the phrase employed by James LJ, in a different but comparable context, in
Tamplin
 
v. 
James
 
(1880) 15 Ch D 215 at 221. Equitable relief may, in my view, be refused because of an
unforeseen change of circumstances not amounting to legal frustration, just as it may on the ground of mistake
insufficient to avoid a contract at law.
In the end, I am satisfied that it is within the court’s discretion to accede to the defendant’s prayer if satisfied
that it is just to do so. And, on the whole, looking at the position of both sides after the long unpredictable delay
for which neither seeks to make the other responsible, I am of the opinion that it is just to leave the plaintiffs to
their remedy in damages if that can indeed be effective.
An important feature of 
Patel
 
was the plaintiffs’ delay in seeking a specific performance
order. It was thus the 
combination
 
of hardship to the defendant and delay by the
plaintiffs (although the two were strongly linked on the facts) that led Goulding J to
conclude that it 
would not be just to make the order. It is a more difficult question
whether or not hardship alone would have sufficed to justify a refusal to make a specific
performance order. It is suggested that it would not. Hardship is a factor which the
courts will consider alongside other factors but it is unlikely on its own to have sufficient
weight to justify a decision to refuse to make an order for specific performance.
24.4
 
Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd v.
Argyll Stores (Holdings) Ltd
The leading modern authority on specific performance is the decision of the House of
Lords in 
Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd
 
v. 
Argyll Stores (Holdings) Ltd
 
[1998] AC
1. The case is particularly important for its consideration of, and re-characterization of,
the ‘constant supervision’ bar to the making of a specific performance order. But the
significance of the case transcends this particular issue. In the course of a broad-ranging
speech Lord Hoffmann surveyed the nature and extent of the discretion exercised by the
court when deciding whether or not to make a specific performance order, the supposed
contrast between common law and civil law systems in their approach to specific
performance, and the impact which the sanction of contempt of court has on the
willingness of the court to make a specific performance order. The commentary which
follows the extract explores the issues largely in the order in which they are raised by
Lord Hoffmann.
CO-OPERATIVE INSURANCE SOCIETY LTD V. ARGYLL
STORES (HOLDINGS) LTD
[1998] AC 1, House of Lords
The facts of the case are set out in the speech of Lord Hoffmann.
Lord Hoffmann
My Lords,
1.
 
The issue
In 1955 Lord Goddard CJ said:
‘No authority has been quoted to show that an injunction will be granted enjoining a person to carry on a
business, nor can I think that one ever would be, certainly not where the business is a losing concern’:
Attorney-General
 
v. 
Colchester Corporation
 
[1955] 2 QB 207, 217.
In this case his prediction has been falsified. The appellant defendants, Argyll
Stores (Holdings) Ltd (‘Argyll’), decided in May 1995 to close their Safeway
supermarket in the Hillsborough Shopping Centre in Sheffield because it was
losing money. This was a breach of a covenant in their lease, which contained in
clause 4(19) a positive obligation to keep the premises open for retail trade during
the usual hours of business. Argyll admitted the breach and, in an action by the
landlord, Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd (‘C.I.S.’) consented to an order for
damages to be assessed. But the Court of Appeal [1996] Ch 286, reversing the
trial judge, ordered that the covenant be specifically performed. It made a final
injunction ordering Argyll to trade on the premises during the remainder of the term
(which will 
expire on 3 August 2014) or until an earlier subletting or assignment.
The Court of Appeal suspended its order for three months to allow time for Argyll to
complete an assignment which by that time had been agreed. After a short agreed
extension, the lease was assigned with the landlord’s consent. In fact, therefore,
the injunction never took effect. The appeal to your Lordships is substantially about
costs. But the issue remains of great importance to landlords and tenants under
other commercial leases.
2.
 
The facts
A decree of specific performance is of course a discretionary remedy and the
question for your Lordships is whether the Court of Appeal was entitled to set aside
the exercise of the judge’s discretion. There are well-established principles which
govern the exercise of the discretion but these, like all equitable principles, are
flexible and adaptable to achieve the ends of equity, which is, as Lord Selborne LC
once remarked, to ‘do more perfect and complete justice’ than would be the result
of leaving the parties to their remedies at common law: 
Wilson
 
v. 
Northampton and
Banbury Junction Railway Co
 
(1874) LR 9 Ch App 279, 284. Much therefore
depends upon the facts of the particular case and I shall begin by describing these
in more detail.
The Hillsborough Shopping Centre consists of about 25 shops. Safeway was
by far the largest shop and the greatest attraction. Its presence was a commercial
benefit to the smaller shops nearby. The lease was for a term of 35 years from 4
August 1979 with five-yearly rent reviews. Clause 4(12)(a) contained a negative
covenant as to the user of the premises:
‘Not to use or suffer to be used the demised premises other than as a retail store for the sale of food
groceries provisions and goods normally sold from time to time by a retail grocer food supermarkets and
food superstores … ’
Clause 4(19) was the positive covenant enforced in this case:
‘To keep the demised premises open for retail trade during the usual hours of business in the locality and
the display windows properly dressed in a suitable manner in keeping with a good class parade of
shops.’
Competition in the supermarket business is fierce and in 1994 Argyll undertook a
major review of its business and decided to reduce the scale of its operations. The
management was to be reorganised, 27 loss-making or less profitable
supermarkets closed and thousands of employees made redundant. Hillsborough,
which according to Argyll’s management accounts had made a loss of about
£70,000 in the previous year, was on the list for closure. For administrative
reasons, as well as to avoid the demoralising effect of successive closure
announcements, it was decided to close all the supermarkets at once and try to
negotiate the disposal of their sites as a package. In early April 1995 Argyll
announced that Hillsborough and the other supermarkets would close on 6 May
1995.
As soon as C.I.S. heard of the impending closure, it protested. On 12 April
1995 Mr Wightman, the regional surveyor of the investment department, wrote to
Mr Jefferies of Safeway:
‘Whilst obviously there is little point in trying to influence your corporate decision with regard to the
closure of this unit I am dismayed at the short period of notice given which will undoubtedly have
immediate impact on the Centre and all the other tenants trading therein.’
He drew attention to the covenant to keep open, invited Safeway to agree to
continue trading until a suitable assignee had been found, offered to negotiate a
temporary rent concession and asked for a reply by return of post.
Unfortunately he received no answer. Mr Jefferies had himself fallen victim to
the reorganisation; he had been made redundant. No one else dealt with the letter.
On Saturday, 6 May 1995 the supermarket closed and over the next two weeks its
fittings were stripped out. On 22 May 1995 C.I.S. issued a writ claiming specific
performance of the covenant to keep open and damages.
3. The trial … The judge refused to order specific performance. He said that
there was on the authorities a settled practice that orders which would require a
defendant to run a business would not be made. …
4.
 
The settled practice
There is no dispute about the existence of the settled practice to which the judge
referred. It is sufficient for this purpose to refer to 
Braddon Towers Ltd
 
v.
International Stores Ltd
 
[1987] 1 EGLR 209, 213, where Slade J said:
‘Whether or not this may be properly described as a rule of law, I do not doubt that for many years
practitioners have advised their clients that it is the settled and invariable practice of this court never to
grant mandatory injunctions requiring persons to carry on business.’
But the practice has never, so far as I know, been examined by this House and it is
open to C.I.S. to say that it rests upon inadequate grounds or that it has been too
inflexibly applied.
Specific performance is traditionally regarded in English law as an exceptional
remedy, as opposed to the common law damages to which a successful plaintiff is
entitled as of right. There may have been some element of later rationalisation of
an untidier history, but by the 19th century it was orthodox doctrine that the power
to decree specific performance was part of the discretionary jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery to do justice in cases in which the remedies available at
common law were inadequate. This is the basis of the general principle that
specific performance will not be ordered when damages are an adequate remedy.
By contrast, in countries with legal systems based on civil law, such as France,
Germany and Scotland, the plaintiff is prima facie entitled to specific performance.
The cases in which he is confined to a claim for damages are regarded as the
exceptions. In practice, however, there is less difference between common law and
civilian systems than these general statements might lead one to suppose. The
principles upon which English judges exercise the discretion to grant specific
performance are reasonably well settled and depend upon a number of
considerations, mostly of a practical nature, which are of very general application. I
have made no investigation of civilian systems, but a priori I would expect that
judges take much the same matters into account in deciding whether specific
performance would be inappropriate in a particular case.
The practice of not ordering a defendant to carry on a business is not entirely
dependent upon damages being an adequate remedy. In 
Dowty Boulton Paul Ltd
v. 
Wolverhampton Corporation
 
[1971] 1 WLR 204, Sir John Pennycuick V-C
refused to order the corporation to maintain an airfield as a going concern
because: ‘It is very well established that the court will not order specific
performance of an obligation to carry on a business’: see p. 211. He added: ‘It is
unnecessary in the circumstances to discuss whether damages would be an
adequate remedy to the company’: see p. 212. Thus the reasons which underlie
the established practice may justify a refusal of specific performance even when
damages are not an adequate remedy.
The most frequent reason given in the cases for declining to order someone to
carry on a business is that it would require constant supervision by the court. In 
J
C Williamson Ltd
 
v. 
Lukey and Mulholland
 
(1931) 45 CLR 282, 297–298, Dixon J
said flatly: ‘Specific performance 
is inapplicable when the continued supervision of
the court is necessary in order to ensure the fulfilment of the contract’.
There has, I think, been some misunderstanding about what is meant by
continued superintendence. It may at first sight suggest that the judge (or some
other officer of the court) would literally have to supervise the execution of the
order. In 
CH Giles & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Morris
 
[1972] 1 WLR 307, 318 Megarry J said that
‘difficulties of constant superintendence’ were a ‘narrow consideration’ because:
‘there is normally no question of the court having to send its officers to supervise the performance of the
order. … Performance … is normally secured by the realisation of the person enjoined that he is liable to
be punished for contempt if evidence of his disobedience to the order is put before the court; … ’
This is, of course, true but does not really meet the point. The judges who have
said that the need for constant supervision was an objection to such orders were
no doubt well aware that supervision would in practice take the form of rulings by
the court, on applications made by the parties, as to whether there had been a
breach of the order. It is the possibility of the court having to give an indefinite
series of such rulings in order to ensure the execution of the order which has been
regarded as undesirable.
Why should this be so? A principal reason is that, as Megarry J pointed out in
the passage to which I have referred, the only means available to the court to
enforce its order is the quasi-criminal procedure of punishment for contempt. This
is a powerful weapon; so powerful, in fact, as often to be unsuitable as an
instrument for adjudicating upon the disputes which may arise over whether a
business is being run in accordance with the terms of the court’s order. The heavy-
handed nature of the enforcement mechanism is a consideration which may go to
the exercise of the court’s discretion in other cases as well, but its use to compel
the running of a business is perhaps the paradigm case of its disadvantages and it
is in this context that I shall discuss them.
The prospect of committal or even a fine, with the damage to commercial
reputation which will be caused by a finding of contempt of court, is likely to have
at least two undesirable consequences. First, the defendant, who ex hypothesi did
not think that it was in his economic interest to run the business at all, now has to
make decisions under a sword of Damocles which may descend if the way the
business is run does not conform to the terms of the order. This is, as one might
say, no way to run a business. In this case the Court of Appeal made light of the
point because it assumed that, once the defendant had been ordered to run the
business, self-interest and compliance with the order would thereafter go hand in
hand. But, as I shall explain, this is not necessarily true.
Secondly, the seriousness of a finding of contempt for the defendant means
that any application to enforce the order is likely to be a heavy and expensive
piece of litigation. The possibility of repeated applications over a period of time
means that, in comparison with a once-and-for-all inquiry as to damages, the
enforcement of the remedy is likely to be expensive in terms of cost to the parties
and the resources of the judicial system.
This is a convenient point at which to distinguish between orders which require
a defendant to carry on an activity, such as running a business over a more or less
extended period of time, and orders which require him to achieve a result. The
possibility of repeated applications for rulings on compliance with the order which
arises in the former case does not exist to anything like the same extent in the
latter. Even if the achievement of the result is a complicated matter which will take
some time, the court, if called upon to rule, only has to examine the finished work
and say whether it complies with the order. This point was made in the context of
relief against forfeiture in 
Shiloh Spinners Ltd
 
v. 
Harding
 
[1973] AC 691. If it is 
a
condition of relief that the tenant should have complied with a repairing covenant,
difficulty of supervision need not be an objection. As Lord Wilberforce said, at p.
724:
‘[W]hat the court has to do is to satisfy itself, ex post facto, that the covenanted work has been done, and
it has ample machinery, through certificates, or by inquiry, to do precisely this.’
This distinction between orders to carry on activities and orders to achieve results
explains why the courts have in appropriate circumstances ordered specific
performance of building contracts and repairing covenants: see 
Wolverhampton
Corporation
 
v. 
Emmons
 
[1901] 1 KB 515 (building contract) and 
Jeune
 
v. 
Queens
Cross Properties Ltd
 
[1974] Ch 97 (repairing covenant). It by no means follows,
however, that even obligations to achieve a result will always be enforced by
specific performance. There may be other objections, to some of which I now turn.
One such objection, which applies to orders to achieve a result and a fortiori to
orders to carry on an activity, is imprecision in the terms of the order. If the terms of
the court’s order, reflecting the terms of the obligation, cannot be precisely drawn,
the possibility of wasteful litigation over compliance is increased. So is the
oppression caused by the defendant having to do things under threat of
proceedings for contempt. The less precise the order, the fewer the signposts to
the forensic minefield which he has to traverse. The fact that the terms of a
contractual obligation are sufficiently definite to escape being void for uncertainty,
or to found a claim for damages, or to permit compliance to be made a condition of
relief against forfeiture, does not necessarily mean that they will be sufficiently
precise to be capable of being specifically enforced. So in 
Wolverhampton
Corporation
 
v. 
Emmons
, Romer LJ said, at p. 525, that the first condition for
specific enforcement of a building contract was that
‘the particulars of the work are so far definitely ascertained that the court can sufficiently see what is the
exact nature of the work of which it is asked to order the performance.’
Similarly in 
Morris
 
v. 
Redland Bricks Ltd
 
[1970] AC 652, 666, Lord Upjohn stated
the following general principle for the grant of mandatory injunctions to carry out
building works:
‘[T]he court must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly in fact what he has to do and this
means not as a matter of law but as a matter of fact, so that in carrying out an order he can give his
contractors the proper instructions.’
Precision is of course a question of degree and the courts have shown themselves
willing to cope with a certain degree of imprecision in cases of orders requiring the
achievement of a result in which the plaintiffs’ merits appeared strong; like all the
reasons which I have been discussing, it is, taken alone, merely a discretionary
matter to be taken into account: see Spry, 
Equitable Remedies
, 4th ed. (1990), p.
112. It is, however, a very important one.
I should at this point draw attention to what seems to me to have been a
misreading of certain remarks of Lord Wilberforce in 
Shiloh Spinners Ltd
 
v.
Harding
, at p. 724. He pointed out, as I have said, that to grant relief against
forfeiture subject to compliance with a repairing covenant involves the court in no
more than the possibility of a retrospective assessment of whether the covenanted
work has been done. For this reason, he said:
‘Where it is necessary, and, in my opinion, right, to move away from some 19th century authorities, is to
reject as a reason against granting relief, the impossibility for the courts to supervise the doing of work.’
This is plainly a remark about cases involving the achievement of a result, such as
doing repairs, and, within that class, about making compliance a condition of relief
against forfeiture. But in 
Tito
 
v. 
Waddell (No 2)
 
[1977] Ch 106, 322 Sir Robert
Megarry V-C took it to be a generalisation about specific performance and, in
particular, a rejection of difficulty of supervision as an 
objection, even in cases of
orders to carry on an activity. Sir Robert Megarry V-C regarded it as an adoption of
his own views (based, as I have said, on incomplete analysis of what was meant
by difficulty of supervision) in 
C H Giles & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Morris
 
[1972] 1 WLR 307, 318.
In the present case [1996] Ch 286, 292–293, Leggatt LJ took this claim at face
value. In fact, Lord Wilberforce went on to say that impossibility of supervision ‘is a
reality no doubt, and explains why specific performance cannot be granted of
agreements to this effect … ’. Lord Wilberforce was in my view drawing attention to
the fact that the collection of reasons which the courts have in mind when they
speak of difficulty of supervision apply with much greater force to orders for
specific performance, giving rise to the possibility of committal for contempt, than
they do to conditions for relief against forfeiture. While the paradigm case to which
such objections apply is the order to carry on an activity, they can also apply to an
order requiring the achievement of a result.
There is a further objection to an order requiring the defendant to carry on a
business, which was emphasised by Millett LJ in the Court of Appeal. This is that it
may cause injustice by allowing the plaintiff to enrich himself at the defendant’s
expense. The loss which the defendant may suffer through having to comply with
the order (for example, by running a business at a loss for an indefinite period)
may be far greater than the plaintiff would suffer from the contract being broken. As
Professor R J Sharpe explains in ‘Specific Relief for Contract Breach’, ch. 5 of
Studies in Contract Law
 
(1980), edited by Reiter and Swan, p. 129:
‘In such circumstances, a specific decree in favour of the plaintiff will put him in a bargaining position vis-
à-vis the defendant whereby the measure of what he will receive will be the value to the defendant of
being released from performance. If the plaintiff bargains effectively, the amount he will set will exceed
the value to him of performance and will approach the cost to the defendant to complete.’ …
It is true that the defendant has, by his own breach of contract, put himself in such
an unfortunate position. But the purpose of the law of contract is not to punish
wrongdoing but to satisfy the expectations of the party entitled to performance. A
remedy which enables him to secure, in money terms, more than the performance
due to him is unjust. From a wider perspective, it cannot be in the public interest for
the courts to require someone to carry on business at a loss if there is any
plausible alternative by which the other party can be given compensation. It is not
only a waste of resources but yokes the parties together in a continuing hostile
relationship. The order for specific performance prolongs the battle. If the
defendant is ordered to run a business, its conduct becomes the subject of a flow
of complaints, solicitors’ letters and affidavits. This is wasteful for both parties and
the legal system. An award of damages, on the other hand, brings the litigation to
an end. The defendant pays damages, the forensic link between them is severed,
they go their separate ways and the wounds of conflict can heal.
The cumulative effect of these various reasons, none of which would
necessarily be sufficient on its own, seems to me to show that the settled practice
is based upon sound sense. Of course the grant or refusal of specific performance
remains a matter for the judge’s discretion. There are no binding rules, but this
does not mean that there cannot be settled principles, founded upon practical
considerations of the kind which I have discussed, which do not have to be re-
examined in every case, but which the courts will apply in all but exceptional
circumstances. As Slade J said, in the passage which I have quoted from 
Braddon
Towers Ltd
 
v. 
International Stores Ltd
 
[1987] 1 EGLR 209, 213, lawyers have no
doubt for many years advised their clients on this basis. In the present case,
Leggatt LJ [1996] Ch 286, 294 remarked that there was no evidence that such
advice had been given. In my view, if the law or practice on a point is settled, it
should be assumed that persons entering into legal transactions will have been
advised accordingly. I am sure that Leggatt LJ would not wish to encourage
litigants to adduce evidence of the particular advice which they received. Indeed, I
doubt whether such evidence would be admissible.
5.
 
The decision of the Court of Appeal
I must now examine the grounds upon which the majority of the Court of Appeal
[1996] Ch 286 thought it right to reverse the judge. In the first place, they regarded
the practice which he followed as outmoded and treated Lord Wilberforce’s
remarks about relief against forfeiture in 
Shiloh Spinners Ltd
 
v. 
Harding
 
[1973] AC
691, 724 as justifying a rejection of the arguments based on the need for constant
supervision. Even Millett LJ, who dissented on other grounds, said, at p. 303, that
such objections had little force today. I do not agree. As I have already said, I think
that Lord Wilberforce’s remarks do not support this proposition in relation to
specific performance of an obligation to carry on an activity and that the arguments
based on difficulty of supervision remain powerful.
The Court of Appeal said that it was enough if the contract defined the tenant’s
obligation with sufficient precision to enable him to know what was necessary to
comply with the order. Even assuming this to be right, I do not think that the
obligation in clause 4(19) can possibly be regarded as sufficiently precise to be
capable of specific performance. It is to ‘keep the demised premises open for retail
trade’. It says nothing about the level of trade, the area of the premises within
which trade is to be conducted, or even the kind of trade, although no doubt the
tenant’s choice would be restricted by the need to comply with the negative
covenant in clause 4(12)(a) not to use the premises ‘other than as a retail store for
the sale of food groceries provisions and goods normally sold from time to time by
a retail grocer food supermarkets and food superstores. …’ This language seems
to me to provide ample room for argument over whether the tenant is doing
enough to comply with the covenant.
The Court of Appeal thought that once Argyll had been ordered to comply with
the covenant, it was, as Roch LJ said, at p. 298, ‘inconceivable that they would not
operate the business efficiently’. Leggatt LJ said, at p. 292, that the requirement:
‘was quite intelligible to the defendants, while they were carrying on business there. … If the premises
are to be run as a business, it cannot be in the defendants’ interest to run it half-heartedly or inefficiently
… ’
This treats the way the tenant previously conducted business as measuring the
extent of his obligation to do so. In my view this is a non sequitur: the obligation
depends upon the language of the covenant and not upon what the tenant has
previously chosen to do. No doubt it is true that it would not be in the interests of
the tenant to run the business inefficiently. But running the business efficiently
does not necessarily mean running it in the way it was run before. Argyll had
decided that, from its point of view, the most efficient thing to do was to close the
business altogether and concentrate its resources on achieving better returns
elsewhere. If ordered to keep the business open, it might well decide that the next
best strategy was to reduce its costs as far as was consistent with compliance with
its obligations, in the expectation that a lower level of return would be more than
compensated by higher returns from additional expenditure on more profitable
shops. It is in my view wrong for the courts to speculate about whether Argyll might
voluntarily carry on business in a way which would relieve the court from having to
construe its order. The question of certainty must be decided on the assumption
that the court might have to enforce the order according to its terms.
C.I.S. argued that the court should not be concerned about future difficulties
which might arise in connection with the enforcement of the order. It should simply
make the order and see what happened. In practice Argyll would be likely to find a
suitable assignee (as it in fact did) 
or conduct the business so as to keep well clear
of any possible enforcement proceedings or otherwise come to terms with C.I.S.
This may well be true, but the likelihood of Argyll having to perform beyond the
requirements of its covenant or buy its way out of its obligation to incur losses
seems to me to be in principle an objection to such an order rather than to
recommend it. I think that it is normally undesirable for judges to make orders in
terrorem, carrying a threat of imprisonment, which work only if no one inquires too
closely into what they mean.
The likelihood that the order would be effective only for a short time until an
assignment is an equivocal argument. It would be burdensome to make Argyll
resume business only to stop again after a short while if a short stoppage would
not cause any substantial damage to the business of the shopping centre. On the
other hand, what would happen if a suitable assignee could not be found? Would
Argyll then have to carry on business until 2014? Mr Smith, who appeared for
C.I.S., said that if the order became oppressive (for example, because Argyll were
being driven into bankruptcy) or difficult to enforce, they could apply for it to be
varied or discharged. But the order would be a final order and there is no case in
this jurisdiction in which such an order has been varied or discharged, except
when the injuncted activity has been legalised by statute. Even assuming that
there was such a jurisdiction if circumstances were radically changed, I find it
difficult to see how this could be made to apply. Difficulties of enforcement would
not be a change of circumstances. They would have been entirely predictable
when the order was made. And so would the fact that Argyll would suffer
unquantifiable loss if it was obliged to continue trading. I do not think that such
expedients are an answer to the difficulties on which the objections to such orders
are based.
Finally, all three judges in the Court of Appeal took a very poor view of Argyll’s
conduct. Leggatt LJ said [1996] Ch 286, 295, that they had acted ‘with gross
commercial cynicism’; Roch LJ began his judgment by saying that they had
‘behaved very badly’ and Millett LJ said, at p. 301, that they had no merits. The
principles of equity have always had a strong ethical content and nothing which I
say is intended to diminish the influence of moral values in their application. I can
envisage cases of gross breach of personal faith, or attempts to use the threat of
non-performance as blackmail, in which the needs of justice will override all the
considerations which support the settled practice. But although any breach of
covenant is regrettable, the exercise of the discretion as to whether or not to grant
specific performance starts from the fact that the covenant has been broken. Both
landlord and tenant in this case are large sophisticated commercial organisations
and I have no doubt that both were perfectly aware that the remedy for breach of
the covenant was likely to be limited to an award of damages. The interests of both
were purely financial: there was no element of personal breach of faith, as in the
Victorian cases of railway companies which refused to honour obligations to build
stations for landowners whose property they had taken: compare 
Greene
 
v. 
West
Cheshire Railway Co
 
(1871) LR 13 Eq 44. No doubt there was an effect on the
businesses of other traders in the Centre, but Argyll had made no promises to
them and it is not suggested that C.I.S. warranted to other tenants that Argyll
would remain. Their departure, with or without the consent of C.I.S., was a
commercial risk which the tenants were able to deploy in negotiations for the next
rent review. On the scale of broken promises, I can think of worse cases, but the
language of the Court of Appeal left them with few adjectives to spare.
It was no doubt discourteous not to have answered Mr Wightman’s letter. But to
say, as Roch LJ did, at p. 299, that they had acted ‘wantonly and quite
unreasonably’ by removing their fixtures seems to me an exaggeration. There was
no question of stealing a march, or attempting to present C.I.S. with a fait
accompli, because Argyll had no reason to believe that C.I.S. would have been
able to obtain a mandatory injunction whether the fixtures had been removed or
not. They had made it perfectly clear that they were closing the shop and given
C.I.S. ample time to apply for such an injunction if so advised.

Conclusion
I think that no criticism can be made of the way in which Judge Maddocks
exercised his discretion. All the reasons which he gave were proper matters for
him to take into account. In my view the Court of Appeal should not have interfered
and I would allow the appeal and restore the order which he made.
Lords Browne-Wilkinson
, 
Slynn
, 
Hope
, and 
Clyde
 
agreed with the speech of
Lord Hoffmann.
Commentary
Lord Hoffmann sought to strike a balance between certainty and flexibility. The
emphasis which he placed on the fact that there are ‘well-established principles which
govern the exercise of the discretion’ and his evident reluctance to disturb a ‘settled
practice’, especially where parties have entered into transactions on the basis of legal
advice as to the existence of such a ‘settled practice’, reflect a concern for certainty. On
the other hand, the emphasis on the need to have regard to the facts of the individual
case and the statement that there are no ‘binding rules’ in this area demonstrate his
awareness of the need to preserve a significant degree of flexibility so that the judge is
able to do justice on the facts of the individual case.
Lord Hoffmann relied upon a number of factors in reaching his conclusion: (i) there was
a settled practice that a specific performance order would not be made the effect of
which would be to require a defendant to run a business, (ii) an order compelling the
defendants to trade could have exposed them to enormous losses, (iii) the task of
framing the order was not an easy one, (iv) there was the possibility of wasteful litigation
over compliance, (v) it was oppressive to the defendants to have to run a business under
the threat of proceedings for contempt, and (vi) it was not in the public interest to
require someone to carry on a business at a loss if there was a plausible alternative by
which the other party could be compensated for the loss it had suffered. Cumulatively
these factors demonstrated that the settled practice not to make a specific performance
order was based on ‘sound sense’ and that the trial judge had acted within his discretion
in refusing to grant the order that the plaintiffs sought. This balancing exercise is a
feature of cases concerned with specific performance. The factors taken into account by
the courts overlap (to some extent) and they can point in different directions. For
example, in 
Co-operative Retail
 
itself, the lack of precision pointed against making the
order, whereas the wilful conduct of the defendants (on which see later) could be said to
have pointed in favour of making the order. The task of the judge is to have regard to the
relevant factors and to balance them and this, in the final analysis, depends, to a large
extent, upon the facts of the individual case.
Lord Hoffmann stated that in practice there may be less difference between common
law and civil law systems in this area than one might suppose (a point developed in
more detail at 
24.6
). This statement does not command universal assent. Thus Lord
Clyde, while he stated that he agreed that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons
given by Lord Hoffmann, was careful to add a reservation in relation to the approach
that might be adopted by ‘civilian systems’. This reservation was clearly made with Scots
law in mind. Lord Clyde’s reservation proved to be well judged. The Inner House of the
Court of Session has since refused to follow 
Co-operative Retail Insurance
 
in 
Highland
and Universal Properties Ltd
 
v. 
Safeway Properties Ltd
 
2000 SLT 414, where it was
held that a covenant to keep retail 
trading premises open for a significant period of time
was specifically enforceable. The case underlines the different approach that is
applicable to specific performance in civilian systems and it demonstrates that the
differences in emphasis between common law systems and civilian systems can have
practical consequences. As Lord President Rodger stated in his judgment:
[L]egal advisers of prospective developers and tenants will have little difficulty in identifying any relevant
difference between the two systems and in handling any resulting problems in either system. The mere fact that
the two systems may come to different results in particular cases is not in my view a sufficient reason for saying
that this court should remould our law so as to reach the same result as would be reached under English law in a
particular situation.
Further support for the proposition that there are important differences between
common law and civilian jurisdictions can be gleaned from academic studies of the
issue. Thus Professor Solène Rowan in her book 
Remedies for Breach of Contract: A
Comparative Analysis of the Protection of Performance
 
(Oxford University Press, 2012)
concludes (at p. 52) that the view ‘that there are few differences between the English and
French approaches to specific performance is fundamentally misguided’ given the vivid
differences that exist between the two systems. A more cautious approach has been
taken by Professor Vanessa Mak in her comparison of English law relating to what she
entitles ‘performance-oriented remedies’ in English, Dutch, and German law
(
Performance-Oriented Remedies in European Sale of Goods Law
 
(Hart Publishing,
2009)). While she acknowledges (at p. 108) that ‘there is indeed an overlap between the
considerations taken into account by courts in common law and civil law systems in
deciding whether specific performance would be inappropriate in a particular case’, she
notes (at p. 95) that the starting points are very different. In English law the restrictions
‘apply to a notion of specific performance that is already subject to severe limitations’
whereas in civil law countries ‘they seek to restrict an otherwise general entitlement to
specific performance’ and this difference ‘may lead to different outcomes in cases that
are otherwise very similar’.
An important issue in 
Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd
 
was the so-called ‘constant
supervision’ objection to the making of a specific performance order. The courts have
traditionally refused to grant a specific performance order that would require ‘constant
supervision’ by the court (see, for example, 
Ryan
 
v. 
Mutual Tontine Association
 
[1893] 1
Ch 116). This objection or bar must be re-cast in the light of Lord Hoffmann’s speech. He
noted that there has been ‘some misunderstanding’ as to the meaning of this phrase and
pointed out that the supervision is undertaken by the parties and not by the courts. The
role of the court is to rule on applications made to it and it is the prospect of a court
being required to give an ‘indefinite series of such rulings’ that lies at the heart of the
desire to restrict the availability of specific performance in these cases.
Lord Hoffmann then turned to the role of contempt of court as a sanction. The problem
here is that contempt of court is too Draconian a sanction, involving, as it does, the
possibility of imprisonment. If contempt were to be removed as a sanction (and
emphasis placed on other means of enforcement, as in many civilian systems) one might
expect the courts to become more willing to make a specific performance order.
The distinction drawn between an obligation to carry on an activity and an obligation to
achieve a result was obviously of crucial significance for Lord Hoffmann. In many cases
it will not be difficult to distinguish the two categories. But in some cases it will be.
Posner
 
v. 
Scott-Lewis
 
[1987] Ch 25 provides an illustration of the problems that might
lie ahead. In 
Posner
 
the plaintiff tenants sought specific performance of a covenant
(clause 3.11) by the defendant landlord to
employ … a resident porter for the following purposes and for no other purposes:– (a) To keep clean the
common staircases and entrance hall landings and passages and lift (b) To be responsible for looking after and
stoking the central heating and domestic hot water boilers (c) To carry down rubbish from the properties to the
dustbins outside the building every day.
The defendants admitted that they did not employ a resident porter but they contended
that they were not in breach of clause 3.11 because the duties were being discharged by a
non-resident porter. Mervyn Davies J rejected this submission on the ground that clause
3.11 clearly required the employment of a ‘resident’ porter and the defendants had, on
their own admission, not employed a resident porter. Turning to the remedy, Mervyn
Davies J concluded that clause 3.11 was a provision susceptible of specific performance.
The defendants relied on the factually similar case of 
Ryan
 
v. 
Mutual Tontine
Association
 
[1893] 1 Ch 116 but Mervyn Davies J dismissed the objection based on
constant supervision. He stated:
I do not see that such an order will occasion any protracted superintendence by the court. If the defendants
without good cause fail to comply with the order in due time, then the plaintiffs can take appropriate
enforcement proceedings against the defendants.
It is not easy to tell on which side of Lord Hoffmann’s line 
Posner
 
falls. Is it an example
of a breach of an obligation to carry on an activity or a breach of an obligation to achieve
a result?
One consequence of the decision of the House of Lords is that it is now extremely
unlikely that a court will make an order which requires a defendant to run a business.
Lord Hoffmann gave a number of reasons in support of his conclusion that such an
order should not be made. One of them was that one effect of making an order requiring
the defendant to carry on a business might be to ‘enable the plaintiff to enrich himself at
the defendant’s expense’. This is not a straightforward proposition. Had a specific
performance order been made on the facts, C.I.S. would only have received the
performance for which it had contracted. What is wrong with that?
Lord Hoffmann concluded that clause 4(19) was insufficiently precise to be capable of
specific performance. Two points should be noted here. The first is the link drawn
between the vagueness of the obligation imposed by the contract upon the defendant
and the ‘constant supervision’ objection as re-characterized by Lord Hoffmann. The two
issues are linked on the basis that, if the terms of the court’s order cannot be precisely
drawn, the possibility of wasteful litigation over compliance is increased and the
likelihood of the court making a specific performance order diminishes. Secondly, it is
important to note the disagreement between the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords
in relation to the precision of clause 4(19). The Court of Appeal held that the clause was
sufficiently precise to be specifically enforceable and relied on the fact that the parties
had operated the lease for a number of years without apparent difficulty. But, as Lord
Hoffmann stated, past practice is not necessarily a good guide to future problems. In his
view, the court must examine the language of the contract and not focus upon what the
tenant had previously chosen to do. The question of the certainty of the term sought to
be enforced must therefore be decided on the assumption 
that the court might have to
enforce the order according to its terms. The court should not shut its eyes to future
difficulties.
Lord Hoffmann attached far less significance to the conduct of the defendants than did
the Court of Appeal. Is the effect of his speech to encourage commercial parties to
engage in cynical, non-co-operative behaviour? Should the law of contract not do more
in terms of encouraging commercial parties to behave in a more ethical manner?
The effect of the decision was to confine the plaintiffs to a claim for damages. Yet there
is a question here as to the adequacy of the damages remedy. Suppose that the
departure of the defendants led to such a loss of trade that other tenants were forced to
close. Would the plaintiffs have been entitled to recover the loss of rent from such
tenants from the defendants? Should the House of Lords not have held that the
plaintiffs were entitled to the remedy of specific performance in order to avoid these
problems of proof of loss? Assume that you are acting for the landlord of a major
shopping centre. What steps can you take to ensure that, as far as possible, the anchor
tenant does not terminate its tenancy before the end of the period of the lease?
Alternatively, how do you ensure that an adequate remedy is available in the event of the
tenant leaving the site early?
24.5
 
Injunctions
A claimant who wishes to restrain a breach of a negative stipulation in a contract or to
restrain a defendant from breaking a term of the contract may apply to the court for an
injunction. As is the case with specific performance, an injunction is an equitable
remedy and, as such, is a discretionary remedy. An injunction will not be granted the
effect of which would be specifically to enforce a contract in a situation where the
remedy of specific performance would not have been available.
Injunctions come in different shapes and sizes and the willingness of a court to grant an
injunction depends, in part, on the nature of the injunction sought. The most
straightforward is a prohibitory injunction which, as its name suggests, orders the
defendant not to do something. Typically, it will prohibit the defendant from performing
certain acts which would otherwise amount to a breach of contract. More difficult to
obtain is a mandatory injunction which orders the defendant to do something, such as to
undo the consequences of an earlier breach of contract. Courts can be very reluctant to
make such an order, especially in the case where the cost of undoing the breach is high
and likely to lead to significant waste. A court will also exercise caution before issuing an
interim injunction. An interim injunction is one sought prior to the trial of the action
and which may apply until final judgment is given. Interim injunctions are often sought
by claimants who need to take immediate steps to protect their interests. In such cases
the court will consider the ‘balance of convenience’ between the competing interests of
the claimant and the defendant when deciding whether or not to grant the relief sought.
A case which illustrates the potential practical importance of injunctions (and, in
particular, of interim injunctions) is 
Araci
 
v. 
Fallon
 
[2011] EWCA Civ 668, [2011] All ER
(D) 37 (Jun). The claimant racehorse owner obtained an interim injunction to restrain
the defendant jockey from breaching his contract with the claimant by riding another
horse in the Derby. The defendant had entered into a ‘Rider Retainer Agreement’ with
the claimant under which the defendant agreed ‘not [to] ride any other horse where [the
defendant] has been retained to ride Native Khan under this retainer’. Notwithstanding
the fact that he had 
been retained to ride Native Khan in the Derby, the defendant
agreed to ride a rival horse, Recital. The Court of Appeal, on the day of the race, granted
an injunction to restrain the defendant from riding any horse other than Native Khan in
the Derby.
It was accepted by both parties that, in the case of a negative stipulation (such as the
undertaking not to ride any other horse after the defendant had been retained to ride
Native Khan in a race), a prohibitory injunction to restrain future breaches of contract
will be granted as a matter of course, unless the grant of an injunction would be
oppressive to the defendant or would cause him particular hardship. It was also agreed
that the balance of convenience test applies to an application for an interim injunction
except ‘where there is a clear and uncontested breach of a covenant not to do a
particular thing’. Finally, where the grant of an injunction amounts ‘in substance to a
final determination at an interim stage, the court will take into account the strengths
and weaknesses of the respective cases, and the likelihood of the claimant’s eventual
success at trial’.
In deciding to grant to the claimant an injunction, the Court of Appeal attached
significance to the fact that the defendant had voluntarily entered into a contract ‘for
substantial reward containing both positive and negative obligations’. Further, there was
‘nothing special’ about the racing world which entitled the defendant ‘to act in flagrant
breach of contract’. The claimant had not been guilty of undue delay or culpable
conduct. The agreement sought to be enforced did not operate in unlawful restraint of
trade, nor was it contrary to public policy. Although the grant of an injunction would be
a ‘grievous blow’ for the defendant, it could not be said that it would be oppressive or
unjust since the defendant had voluntarily entered into the agreement. It was also
observed that damages would not be an adequate remedy for the claimant, given the
uncertainty surrounding the assessment of damages (for example, who would have won
the Derby if the defendant had been riding (i) Native Khan or (ii) Recital?). But this was
not a material factor because, as Elias LJ observed, the adequacy of damages is not
generally a relevant consideration when the injunction restrains a breach of a negative
covenant.
24.6
 
Future Directions
Should English law continue to develop a more liberal approach to the availability of
specific performance and recognize the existence of a general right to specific
performance? Professor Schwartz (‘The Case for Specific Performance’ (1979) 89 
Yale LJ
271, 277) has argued that the law should develop in this direction. In his view:
[the] restrictions on the availability of specific performance cannot be justified on the basis that damage awards
are usually compensatory. On the contrary, the compensation goal implies that specific performance should be
routinely available. This is because damage awards actually are undercompensatory in more cases than is
commonly supposed; the fact of a specific performance request is itself good evidence that damages would be
inadequate; and courts should delegate to promisees the decision of which remedy best satisfies the
compensation goal.
Others have been more hesitant (see, for example, A Burrows, 
Remedies for Torts,
Breach of Contract, and Equitable Wrongs
 
(4th edn, Oxford University Press, 2019),
pp. 412–415; A Kronman, ‘Specific Performance’ (1978) 45 
U Chicago L Rev
 
351, and SA
Smith, ‘Performance, 
Punishment and the Nature of Contractual Obligation’ (1997) 60
MLR
 
360). The principal arguments against the recognition of a general right to specific
performance are that the present law is congruent with the intention of contracting
parties and so reduces transaction costs (Kronman), the fact that the mitigation rule
does not apply to claims for specific performance so that a general right to specific
performance would not encourage claimants to take reasonable steps to minimize their
loss (Burrows), that specific performance constitutes a greater infringement of
individual liberty than a remedy in damages to the extent that it requires the defendant
to carry out an act that he is no longer willing to perform (Burrows), and that forced
performance is ‘self-defeating’ because the bonds created by the voluntary undertakings
contained in the contract can only be realized by performance that is itself voluntary
(Smith).
It is difficult to strike a balance between these competing arguments. The argument that
specific performance amounts to an infringement of individual liberty can be countered
by the argument that the initial promise was voluntarily given so that there is, in fact, no
violation of individual liberty because the defendant is only being ordered to do that
which he had already promised to do. The argument that mitigation does not apply to
specific performance is true but against that must be weighed the argument that
claimants have a strong incentive not to seek specific performance in practice because ‘a
breaching promisor is reluctant to perform and may be hostile’ (Schwartz, ‘The Case for
Specific Performance’ (1979) 89 
Yale LJ
 
271, 277). This incentive to seek performance
elsewhere from a willing contracting party should counter the temptation not to take
reasonable steps to mitigate loss.
The argument that the present law is congruent with the intention of contracting parties
is more difficult to assess, largely because of the lack of empirical evidence as to the
intentions of contracting parties. However, it has been argued (Kronman, ‘Specific
Performance’ (1978) 45 
U Chicago L Rev
 
351) that the present rules relating to specific
performance do reflect the wishes of contracting parties as to the availability of the
remedy and hence reduce the cost of negotiating contracts. Professor Kronman notes
that the ‘most important common feature’ of the cases where specific performance is
available is that the subject matter of the contract is unique and he argues that it is only
where the goods are unique that the parties will wish to contract for specific
performance. This reasoning has been convincingly criticized by Professor Schwartz
(‘The Case for Specific Performance’ (1979) 89 
Yale LJ
 
271). It is likely that no one factor
can be identified that conclusively determines the parties’ remedial preferences; they
are, in large part, context dependent. This being the case, it is very difficult to rely on the
intention of the parties either in support of the current rule or as part of an attempt to
widen the availability of specific performance.
Nevertheless, it may be the case that English law should, in fact, pay greater attention to
the wishes of the contracting parties, at least where that intention is expressed in the
terms of the contract. At present the decision whether or not to order specific
performance lies in the discretion of the court: the parties cannot exercise that
discretion on behalf of the court. In 
Quadrant Visual Communications Ltd
 
v. 
Hutchison
Telephone UK Ltd
 
[1993] BCLC 442, 451 Stocker LJ stated that ‘once the court is asked
for the equitable remedy of specific performance, its discretion cannot be fettered’ by the
stipulation of the parties. The parties could not, by the terms of their contract, confine
the role of the court to that of a ‘rubber stamp’. While it is right that the courts should
not be bound by the stipulation of the parties, it can be argued that they should treat it
with considerable respect, particularly where the parties are of equal bargaining power,
and only refuse to give effect to it where there are strong countervailing policy
considerations (the case for attaching stronger weight to the agreement of the parties
has been made by S Rowan, ‘For the Recognition of Remedial Terms Agreed Inter
Partes’ (2010) 126 
LQR
 
448, esp. pp. 449–455). In this respect, the facts 
of 
Quadrant
Visual Communications
 
might provide an illustration of such countervailing policy
considerations. The plaintiff was held not to be entitled to specific performance on the
ground that it was guilty of some ‘trickery’ in failing to disclose to the defendants an
agreement which the court held that it should have disclosed to them.
A further factor fuelling the demand for a more liberal availability of specific
performance is the impact of comparative law. The secondary role accorded to specific
performance in English law contrasts with civilian systems where specific performance
(or specific implement, as it is known in Scotland) is a primary remedy. While there
appears to be a high degree of correlation between the situations in which the different
legal systems refuse to order specific performance (in that courts are generally reluctant
to order specific performance where performance of the contract would be impossible,
unlawful, or expose the performing party to severe hardship), the difference between the
systems lies, not so much in the circumstances in which the courts generally refuse to
order specific performance, but in the starting point for the reasoning of the court. In
most civilian jurisdictions specific performance is a primary remedy so that the court
will assume that the claimant is entitled to the remedy unless the defendant can show
that, for some reason, the claimant is not entitled to it. In England, on the other hand, it
is for the claimant to establish his entitlement to specific performance. It could be said
that this is no more than a difference in the location of the burden of proof. In England
it is the claimant who bears the burden of establishing his entitlement to specific
performance, whereas in civilian systems it is for the defendant to show that the
claimant is not entitled to the remedy. The stronger view is that the difference is a
matter of substance and not simply a matter relating to the burden of proof.
It has proved to be very difficult to bridge the gulf between common law and civilian
systems when drafting international conventions on contract law. Article 28 of the
Vienna Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods states:
If, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, one party is entitled to require performance of any
obligation by the other party, a court is not bound to enter a judgement for specific performance unless the
court would do so under its own law in respect of similar contracts of sale not governed by this Convention.
This provision is clearly a compromise between common law and civil law systems in
(1)
(2)
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(3)
that it entitles a court asked to make a specific performance order to have regard to its
own domestic or national law and does not require it to make a specific performance
order in circumstances where it would not do so were it applying domestic law. Rather
than attempt to bridge the gap between the common law and civil law, Article 28 draws
attention to that gap by leaving the problem to national law.
Rather more progress was, however, made by those responsible for drafting the
Principles of European Contract Law. Article 9:102 states:
Non-monetary Obligations
The aggrieved party is entitled to specific performance of an obligation other than one to pay money,
including the remedying of a defective performance.
Specific performance cannot, however, be obtained where:
performance would be unlawful or impossible; or
performance would cause the obligor unreasonable effort or expense; or
the performance consists in the provision of services or work of a personal character or depends
upon a personal relationship; or
the aggrieved party may reasonably obtain performance from another source.
The aggrieved party will lose the right to specific performance if it fails to seek it within a reasonable
time after it has or ought to have become aware of the non-performance.
This provision also represents a compromise but it is a rather more elaborate one than
that found in the Vienna Convention (a similar compromise is to be found in Article
7.2.2 of the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts). Paragraph (1)
recognizes the existence of a general entitlement to specific performance (thus reflecting
the approach taken in civil law systems) while paragraphs (2) and (3) take account of (at
least some of) the concerns of English lawyers by providing that, in certain
circumstances, specific performance is not to be ordered (although it should be noted
that it is difficult to tell how far these concerns have been taken into account because
much depends on the meaning of phrases such as ‘unreasonable effort or expense’ and
the weight to be given to these factors—for example, how would the 
Co-operative
Insurance Society
 
case have been decided under Article 9:102?).
Article 9:102 attempts to strike a balance between the competing interests at stake, and
the reality is that a balance must be struck between these interests in all legal systems
(whether common law or civilian). On the one hand, we have the interest of the claimant
in obtaining the performance for which he contracted and to which he claims to be
entitled. On the other hand, to require the defendant to perform his contractual
obligations may cause him unnecessary hardship or result in an inefficient use of
resources. It is no easy task to strike the right balance. While English law has moved
some way from its original, restrictive approach to specific performance, it still has some
way to go before it can be said to have struck the right balance. As cases such as 
Co-
operative Insurance Society
 
demonstrate, the courts can still, on occasion, give
insufficient emphasis to the performance interest of the claimant.

Third Parties
Central Issues
The general rule at common law in England is that a third party cannot
acquire rights under a contract to which he is not a party nor can he
be subject to a burden by a contract to which he is not a party. These
rules are known as the doctrine of privity of contract.
The rule that a third party cannot acquire rights under a contract to
which he is not a party has proved to be a controversial one and the
courts over time have created a number of exceptions to it. But the
exceptions are of limited scope and they did not bring to an end the
demands for reform of this rule.
Reform was eventually implemented in the form of the Contracts
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. The 1999 Act provides a relatively
simple mechanism by which contracting parties can confer upon a
third party a right to enforce a term of their contract. The dominant
philosophy which underpins the 1999 Act is one of freedom of
contract, so it is possible for the contracting parties to define for
themselves the scope of the third party right of action.
The 1999 Act has not, however, escaped criticism. Some have
questioned the justifications put forward in support of the proposition
that a third party should be entitled to enforce a term of a contract to
which he is not a party. The principal objections put forward are that
the third party is not a promisee, nor has he provided any
consideration for the promise, and so he ought not to be entitled to a
remedy in his own right. The competing arguments for and against
recognition of a third party right of action are considered in this
chapter.
The 1999 Act does not abolish the exceptions to the doctrine of privity
that pre-dated the Act. However, it is likely that the practical
6.
7.
significance of these exceptions will diminish over time. Contracting
parties who wish to confer an enforceable right of action upon a third
party are more likely to use the 1999 Act than the pre-Act exceptions.
A contracting party who, in breach of contract, fails to confer a benefit
on a third party will incur a liability towards the other party to the
contract. The remedies available to the latter party are not affected by
the 1999 Act and, in certain circumstances, he may be able to obtain a
remedy, such as a specific performance order, which will be of benefit
to the third party. The circumstances in 
which a contracting party can
sue and recover damages on behalf of a third party are an issue of
some controversy that is discussed in this chapter.
As a general rule, parties to a contract cannot impose an obligation on
a third party without the latter’s consent. The existence of this general
rule is widely accepted. While it is the subject of some exceptions,
neither the general rule nor its exceptions are affected by the 1999 Act.
25.1
 
Introduction
A contract creates rights and obligations as between the parties to the contract. But what
impact does it have on third parties, that is to say those who are not party to the
contract? Broadly speaking, there are two questions to be answered here. The first is
whether or not a third party can acquire any rights under the contract, and the second is
whether or not the contract can impose upon him obligations or liabilities. The general
rule which English law has adopted is that the contract creates rights and imposes
obligations only between the parties to the contract: the third party thus neither
acquires rights under the contract nor is he subject to liabilities. This general rule is
known as the doctrine of privity of contract. The rule is the subject of a number of
exceptions and the scope of these exceptions, particularly in relation to the acquisition
of contractual rights by third parties, has been a source of considerable controversy.
Indeed, Professor Treitel has stated (
Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract
Law
 
(Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 47) that the ‘most significant doctrinal
development in English contract law in the twentieth century was no doubt the outcome
of what I shall call the battle over privity’. The outcome of that battle was the enactment
of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (generally referred to in this chapter
as ‘the 1999 Act’). This Act is now the most important source of the law relating to third
party rights in that it provides a relatively simple means by which contracting parties
can, if they so desire, confer upon a third party the right to enforce a term of the
contract. It is, however, important to note that the Act does not purport to abolish the
doctrine of privity with the consequence that, in a case that falls outside the scope of the
Act, the doctrine of privity remains applicable. On the other hand, it can be said that the
Act introduces into English law a limited third party right of action.
The bulk of this chapter will be devoted to the topic of the acquisition of contractual
rights by third parties. The reason for this is that it has proved to be the most
contentious aspect of the doctrine of privity. By contrast, the rule that the parties to a
contract cannot impose a contractual liability upon a third party is generally accepted,
although it too is a rule that is subject to some exceptions. The reason for the general
acceptance of the latter rule is that it would be an ‘unwarranted infringement of a third
party’s liberty if contracting parties were able, as a matter of course, to impose burdens
on a third party without his or her consent’ (Law Commission, 
Privity of Contract:
Contracts for the Benefit of Third Parties
, Law Com No 242 (1996), para 2.1). Before
examining the dual aspects of the doctrine of privity, it is important to examine the
relationship between third party rights of action and the contract structures that are
commonly adopted in commercial practice.
25.2
 
Contract Structures
An impression that is often gained from a reading of contract cases is that all contracts
have two parties to them and that each contract is separate and distinct from every other
contract. Any such impression is misleading. Contracts can and frequently do involve
more than two parties. But that is not our present concern. Rather our concern is with
the proposition that each contract is separate and distinct from every other contract.
This proposition is simply not true. Contracts are linked in many complex ways. Two
hypotheticals will illustrate the point, one drawn from the commercial sphere and the
other based on a more commonplace example involving a consumer.
The commercial example is based loosely on the facts of the case of 
Junior Books Ltd
 
v.
Veitchi Co Ltd
 
[1983] 1 AC 520. A company (X) wishes to have a new factory built and,
for this purpose, enters into a contract with another company (Y) which agrees to design
and build the factory. Y cannot provide all of the necessary services itself and so, to the
knowledge of X, it plans to sub-contract some of the work to company Z. X is content to
allow Y to sub-contract the work in this way and is also generally satisfied with the
quality of Z’s work but it nevertheless harbours a concern that an employee of Z might,
through his negligence, cause damage to the works and thereby inflict loss on X. How
can X take steps to protect itself in this situation? One possibility is to resort to a claim
in tort in the event of negligence on the part of an employee of Z. The problem with this
strategy is that X is likely to encounter severe difficulties in bringing a claim in tort in
the event that it suffers economic loss as a result of the negligence of Z (the courts being
extremely reluctant to find liability in tort in the case of economic loss: see 
D & F Estates
Ltd
 
v. 
Church Commissioners for England and Wales
 
[1989] AC 177).
What contractual routes of redress are open to X? The obvious claim is against Y, its
contracting party. Here it is important for X to ensure that Y assumes a contractual
responsibility for the quality of the works that includes the work to be carried out by Z.
Then, in the event of a breach of duty by Z, X can sue Y for breach of contract and then
leave Y to seek redress from Z. This is a commonly used structure, although the risk
inherent in it is that Y will become insolvent before making payment in full to X, leaving
X with no obvious means of redress against Z. An alternative strategy is for X to require
that Z enter into a contract with it under which Z promises to exercise reasonable care
and skill in the performance of its obligations. Such a warranty, commonly known as a
collateral warranty, will generally be entered into in the form of a deed in order to avoid
any argument about whether or not X has provided consideration for Z’s promise to
exercise reasonable care and skill.
We can look at the same transaction from the perspective of Z. Z may be concerned
about its exposure to a claim by X. For example, it may have a very good working
relationship with Y and prefer to assume responsibility only to Y. It may therefore be
unwilling to provide a collateral warranty to X (although it may not in practice have the
bargaining power to resist such a demand).
We can see that there are two principal structural options open to the parties in this
case. The first is for Z to assume a contractual responsibility towards Y and for Y to
assume contractual responsibility to X but Z does not assume such a responsibility
towards X. In this example (subject to the possibility of a claim in tort) liability will be
left to flow down the chain of contracts. Thus in the event of a breach by Z which results
in loss to X, X will sue Y and Y will then sue Z but X cannot sue Z directly. The second is
for Z to assume a direct contractual responsibility to X in addition to Y’s contractual
responsibilities to X. The point 
to grasp here is that the parties have a choice to make
and (at least in the case of parties who are legally advised) they will have their reasons
for choosing one type of contract structure in preference to another and, further, they
will expect the courts to respect and give effect to the distribution of rights and
obligations set out by the particular contract structure they have chosen.
Now let us feed into the equation the possibility of a third party right of action. The
obvious advantage of a third party right of action is that it provides another means by
which X can protect its position. X could insist that Y insert a clause into its contract
with Z the effect of which would be to confer on X a right to enforce the term of the
contract by which Z assumed an obligation to exercise reasonable care and skill in the
performance of its duties. The ability to confer an enforceable right of action on the third
party appears to perform a useful function (although not everyone accepts this, see
25.3.5
) in that it provides a means by which contracting parties can give effect to their
intention to confer an enforceable right of action upon a third party. But the parties will
obviously not want the courts to imply the existence of a third party right of action in the
case where the parties have chosen to structure their transaction in such a way that Z
does not assume a direct contractual responsibility to X but only to Y. In such a case,
recognition of a direct third party right of action in X would cut across the contract
structure adopted by the parties and could result in a distribution of liability other than
that intended by the parties. It must be stressed at this point that such a result is not an
inevitable consequence of the introduction of a third party right of action. But this
example does underline the need for any third party right of action to be sensitive to the
contract structure that has been adopted by the parties.
Our second example is a consumer transaction and can be dealt with more quickly.
Suppose that a consumer wishes to buy a car on credit but the car dealer cannot provide
the credit facilities himself. A finance house is, however, prepared to provide the
finance. How can these three parties structure their transaction? They have a range of
possibilities open to them but these possibilities can be divided into two broad groups.
The first and most commonly adopted structure is for the car dealer to sell the car to the
finance house which will then supply the car to the consumer on credit terms. Very often
consumers are unaware of the fact that this is the structure which they have agreed. As
far as they are concerned they are purchasing a car from the dealer. But in law there are
two transactions taking place, not one. The first is the sale by the car dealer to the
finance house and the second is the transaction between the finance house and the
consumer. One drawback to this structure is that, in the absence of a collateral contract
(which the courts may be prepared to imply, see 
Andrews
 
v. 
Hopkinson
 
[1957] 1 QB
229), there is no direct contractual relationship between the dealer and the consumer.
This may be a problem in the event that the car proves to be defective. The consumer
wants a claim against the dealer, not the finance house and, for that matter, the finance
house does not want to involve itself in the repair of the car. Its intention is to provide
the finance, not the services of a mechanic. But in legal theory (at least as far as the
common law is concerned) the consumer has a claim against the finance house and the
finance house has a claim against the dealer, but the consumer does not have a direct
claim against the dealer, albeit in practice the problem will be resolved by the consumer
dealing directly with the dealer.
The second alternative is for the dealer to sell the car to the consumer and then either
the consumer or the dealer to enter into a credit transaction with the finance house.
Thus the dealer may agree to sell the car to the consumer and then assign its contractual
rights against the consumer to the finance house in return for an immediate payment by
the finance house. Suppose that the consumer has agreed to pay the dealer £5,500 for
the car over a two-year 
period (this sum being known as a receivable). In return for
assigning to the finance house its rights against the consumer the dealer may be able to
obtain immediate payment from the finance house of a percentage of the sum due to it
from the consumer, say £5,000. The dealer may even have an agreement with the
finance house under which the dealer agrees to sell all its receivables to the finance
house in return for immediate payment. Alternatively, the dealer may sell the car to the
consumer and the consumer can then enter into a transaction with the finance house in
order to obtain the credit necessary to pay the dealer (such as a sale and lease-back). In
both of these alternatives there is a direct contractual relationship between the dealer
and the consumer so that this time the consumer will have a direct claim against the
dealer in the event that the car proves to be defective. But, once again, the point to be
made is that contracting parties (at least in the case of the dealer and the finance house)
frequently give a great deal of thought to the contractual structures which they adopt
and they take into account a broad range of factors in making a decision about the
contract structure that is most beneficial to them (these factors include matters such as
liability for defects and tax and accounting considerations). As was the case in the
example drawn from the commercial sphere, any introduction of a third party right of
action must be sensitive to this fact and not produce a right of action which cuts across,
or undermines, the distribution of rights and obligations that has been agreed by the
parties.
25.3
 
Third Parties and the Acquisition of
Contractual Rights
The enactment of the 1999 Act constitutes a watershed in any discussion of the
contractual rights of third parties. Given its importance today it should be the first item
for discussion. Yet it is very difficult, if not impossible, to appreciate the significance of
the Act without an understanding of the way in which the law has evolved. The Act must
be placed in its context. In order to do this it is necessary to examine the cases which
established the general rule at common law that a third party does not have a right to
enforce a term of a contract to which he is not a party, the various exceptions to the
general rule that were recognized prior to the enactment of the 1999 Act, and the
arguments that were advanced both in support of, and in opposition to, the reform of
the law that culminated in the 1999 Act.
The discussion of the acquisition of contractual rights by third parties will therefore be
divided into six parts. The first part (
25.3.1
) will focus upon the two leading cases in
which the doctrine of privity of contract was established at common law. The second
part (
25.3.2
) shifts attention to the position of the contracting parties themselves. It may
seem out of place to analyse the rights of the contracting parties in the context of a
discussion of the rights of the third party. But this is not so. Take the case of a contract
between A and B under which B promises to do some work for A and A promises, in
return, to pay a sum of money to C. Assume that B does the work for A but that A refuses
in breach of contract to pay any money to C. In this situation B (generally referred to as
‘the promisee’) has a claim against A for breach of contract and the question which falls
for consideration is whether or not B can obtain a remedy from A the effect of which will
be to give C the promised performance. The third part (
25.3.3
) returns to the position of
the third party and considers the exceptions to the doctrine of privity that were
recognized at common law and by statute prior to the enactment of the 1999 Act. The
fourth part (
25.3.4
) is devoted to the subject of third parties, exclusion clauses, and
exclusive jurisdiction clauses. In many ways this line of cases could 
have been
accommodated within part three but they raise issues of some difficulty and so merit
separate discussion. The fifth part (
25.3.5
) is concerned with the debate over the reform
of the doctrine of privity that preceded the enactment of the 1999 Act. The final part
(
25.3.6
) is devoted to the 1999 Act itself. The principal provisions of the Act are analysed
and consideration will also be given to the impact of the Act on some of the cases that
pre-dated the 1999 Act.
25.3.1
 
The General Rule at Common Law: Third
Parties Have No Right of Action
Professor Ibbetson states (
A Historical Introduction to the Law of Obligations
 
(Oxford
University Press, 1999), p. 241) that the ‘rule that a third party could not enforce rights
arising under a contract has been a feature of English law since at least the thirteenth
century’. English law was not alone in adopting this stance. According to classical
Roman law a contract created rights and obligations only between the parties to it and
did not have any effect, whether in terms of the acquisition of rights or the imposition of
liabilities, upon third parties. Over time the influence of classical Roman law on the
continent of Europe waned. The influence of natural lawyers, such as Grotius, and the
emphasis which they placed on the importance of the will of the parties and upon
consensus or agreement led to the gradual recognition of the contract in favour of a
third party. Thus Professor Zimmermann concludes (
The Law of Obligations
 
(Oxford
University Press, 1996), p. 42) that in ‘the 17th century the great breakthrough towards
the recognition of the contract in favour of the third party had taken place and the
prevailing new attitude had already influenced many of the codes of that time’. For a
time it appeared that English law might follow the lead taken on the continent of
Europe. Cases can be found which appeared to support the existence of a third party
right of action (see, for example, 
Dutton
 
v. 
Poole
 
(1678) 2 Lev 210, 
Pigott
 
v. 
Thompson
(1802) 3 Bos & Pul 98, and 
Carnegie
 
v. 
Waugh
 
(1823) 1 LJ (KB) 89). But, equally, there
were cases which were hostile to the existence of such a third party right of action (see,
for example, 
Crow
 
v. 
Rogers
 
(1724) 1 Str 591 and 
Price
 
v. 
Easton
 
(1833) 4 B & Ad 433).
The cases thus appeared to be in some disarray. The case which is credited with
resolving the conflict and committing English law to the rule that a third party cannot
acquire contractual rights under a contract to which he is not a party is the decision of
the Court of Queen’s Bench in 
Tweddle
 
v. 
Atkinson
 
(1861) 1 B & S 393, as subsequently
confirmed by the House of Lords in the leading case of 
Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd
v. 
Selfridge and Co Ltd
 
[1915] AC 847. These two cases established the doctrine of
privity of contract as a ‘fundamental’ principle of English contract law and it is therefore
necessary to examine them in more detail.
TWEDDLE V. ATKINSON
(1861) 1 B & S 393, 121 ER 762, Court of Queen’s Bench
William Tweddle married the daughter of William Guy. Prior to the wedding William
Guy entered into a verbal agreement with John Tweddle, William Tweddle’s father,
under which both promised to give their children marriage portions. After the
wedding had taken place, they entered into a written agreement which was
intended to give effect to their verbal 
promises under which William Guy agreed to
pay £200 to William Tweddle and John Tweddle agreed to pay him £100. The
agreement contained the following sentence: ‘it is hereby further agreed by the
aforesaid William Guy and the said John Tweddle that the said William Tweddle
has full power to sue the said parties in any Court of law or equity for the aforesaid
sums hereby promised and specified.’ William Guy failed to pay the promised
amount and so William Tweddle brought an action against the executor of William
Guy’s estate for the sum of £200. His claim failed.
Wightman J
Some of the old decisions appear to support the proposition that a stranger to the
consideration of a contract may maintain an action upon it, if he stands in such a
near relationship to the party from whom the consideration proceeds, that he may
be considered a party to the consideration. The strongest of those cases is that
cited in 
Bourne
 
v. 
Mason
 
1 Ventr 6, in which it was held that the daughter of a
physician might maintain assumpsit upon a promise by her father to give her a
sum of money if he performed a certain cure. But there is no modern case in which
the proposition has been supported. On the contrary, it is now established that no
stranger to the consideration can take advantage of a contract, although made for
his benefit.
Crompton J
The modern cases have, in effect, overruled the old decisions; they shew that the
consideration must move from the party entitled to sue upon the contract. It would
be a monstrous proposition to say that a person was a party to the contract for the
purpose of suing upon it for his own advantage, and not a party to it for the
purpose of being sued …
Blackburn J
… Mr Mellish [counsel for the plaintiff] admits that in general no action can be
maintained upon a promise, unless the consideration moves from the party to
whom it is made. But he says that there is an exception; namely, that when the
consideration moves from a father, and the contract is for the benefit of his son, the
natural love and affection between the father and son gives the son the right to sue
as if the consideration had proceeded from himself. And 
Dutton and Wife
 
v. 
Poole
was cited for this. We cannot overrule a decision of the Exchequer Chamber; but
there is a distinct ground on which that case cannot be supported. The cases …
shew that natural love and affection are not a sufficient consideration whereon an
action of assumpsit may be founded.
Commentary
Why did William Tweddle’s claim fail? Two possible reasons can be given. The first is
that he was not a party to the contract concluded between his father and his father-in-
law. The second is that he did not provide any consideration for William Guy’s promise
to pay him £200. Which reason was invoked by the judges in 
Tweddle
? It would appear
that their focus was on the latter rule. Counsel for the defendant submitted that ‘it is
now settled that an action for breach of contract must be brought by the person from
whom the consideration moved’ and cited 
Price
 
v. 
Easton
 
(1833) 4 B & Ad 433 in
support of his submission. Counsel for the 
plaintiff, Mr Mellish, accepted that there was
such a general rule but submitted that there was an exception to it in the case of
contracts made by parents for the purpose of providing for their children. Thus battle
was joined on the issue whether or not William Tweddle was a ‘stranger’ to the
consideration provided by his father. The acceptance by Mr Mellish of this general rule
has been criticized (see R Flannigan, ‘Privity—The End of an Era (Error)’ (1987) 103
LQR
 
564, 571) on the basis that ‘it seems entirely unsatisfactory that the general third
party right of action should be lost on an unnecessary concession’. This criticism is not
without foundation. As we have noted, the cases did not all point one way (although one
would scarcely guess this from the tenor of the judgments in 
Tweddle
) and in 1859 the
New York Court of Appeals had taken a step in the opposite direction in 
Lawrence
 
v.
Fox
, 20 NY 268 (1859) when it recognized the existence of a third party right of action
(although the case did not even merit a mention either in argument or in the judgments
in 
Tweddle
). On the other hand, it could be said that the criticism misses the point in
that the reason given by the judges for the failure of William Tweddle’s claim was not
that he was a third party but that he had not provided any consideration for the promise
made by William Guy.
Two further points should be noted about 
Tweddle
. The first is that it underlines the fact
that there is a close relationship between the rule that consideration must move from
the promisee (on which see 
5.2.4
) and the doctrine of privity. In many cases the former
rule renders discussion of the latter unnecessary. 
Tweddle
 
itself illustrates this point.
The judges found that William Tweddle had not provided any consideration. His claim
was therefore doomed to fail and it was not necessary for them to consider whether or
not his claim was also bound to fail on the ground that he was a third party. It is
therefore only in the rare case where the third party has provided consideration but is
not party to the agreement that the need for a distinct third party rule emerges. Such
cases are likely to be very rare. Treitel gives the following example (
The Law of Contract
(15th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited by Edwin Peel), para 14–014):
A father might, for example, promise his daughter to pay £1,000 to anyone who married her. A man who
married the daughter with knowledge of and in reliance on such a promise might provide consideration for it,
but could not enforce it, as it was not addressed to him.
In this example the doctrines of consideration and privity do appear to be separate and
distinct (unless one takes the view that only an offeree can give consideration to the
offeror so as to make a contract in which case there would be no contract at all on the
facts of Professor Treitel’s hypothetical and so no contract for anyone to be privy to).
The second point to note about 
Tweddle
 
relates to the position of William Tweddle’s
father, John Tweddle. Why did he not bring a claim against William Guy’s executor?
One reason might have been that he had not paid his son the promised £100. Lord
Denning in 
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswick
 
[1966] Ch 538, 553–554 offered the following analysis of
Tweddle
:
The action failed for the very good reason that the husband’s father had not done his part. He had not paid his
promised £100. The son could not himself be sued for his father’s failure to pay the £100: for he was no party to
the contract. So he could not be allowed to sue his wife’s father for the £200. … But if the husband’s father had
paid his £100 and thus wholly performed his part, then the husband’s father in his lifetime, or his executor after
his death, could have sued the wife’s father or his executor for the £200. As Wightman J observed 1 B & S 393,
397:
‘If the father of the plaintiff had paid the £100 which he promised, might not he have sued the father of
the plaintiff’s wife on his express promise?’
To which the answer would undoubtedly be: ‘Yes, he could sue and recover the £200’, but he would recover it
not for his own benefit, or for the benefit of the estate, but for the benefit of the son.
The difficulty with this view is that no reference is made in the judgments to the position
of John Tweddle. Lord Denning’s reference to the observation of Wightman J is to an
observation made by him in the course of argument and it does not amount to a
categorical statement that the promised £100 had not in fact been paid. The point is,
however, one of some significance and we shall return to it when we come to apply the
1999 Act to the facts of 
Tweddle
 
(
25.3.6
). Nevertheless, it is not possible to confine the
rule laid down in 
Tweddle
 
in such a narrow way. The reason for this is to be found in the
next case, a decision of the House of Lords.
DUNLOP PNEUMATIC TYRE CO LTD V. SELFRIDGE AND
CO LTD
[1915] AC 847, House of Lords
In 1911, Messrs Dew, motor accessory agents, agreed to buy a quantity of tyres
and other goods from Dunlop (the appellants) who carried on business as motor
tyre manufacturers. Dunlop agreed to give Dew certain discounts off their list price
and Dew in return agreed not to sell Dunlop’s goods to any person at less than the
list prices. However, it was also agreed that Dew could give genuine trade
customers a limited discount off Dunlop’s list prices if, as agents of Dunlop, Dew
obtained from the trader a similar written undertaking that it would observe the list
prices. On 2 January 1912, the respondents, Selfridge, large storekeepers who
sold tyres by retail to the public, ordered Dunlop tyres from Dew. Dew agreed to
give Selfridge certain discounts off Dunlop’s list prices and Selfridge agreed not to
sell any Dunlop tyres to private customers at less than the list prices. Dunlop sued
Selfridge for breach of this undertaking when Selfridge sold Dunlop tyres to private
customers for less than the list prices. The trial judge gave judgment for Dunlop.
The Court of Appeal reversed this decision on the ground that the agreement of 2
January 1912 was not a contract between Dunlop and Selfridge but between Dew
and Selfridge. The House of Lords dismissed Dunlop’s appeal.
Viscount Haldane LC
My Lords, in the law of England certain principles are fundamental. One is that
only a person who is a party to a contract can sue on it. Our law knows nothing of
a 
jus quaesitum tertio
 
arising by way of contract. Such a right may be conferred
by way of property, as, for example, under a trust, but it cannot be conferred on a
stranger to a contract as a right to enforce the contract in personam. A second
principle is that if a person with whom a contract not under seal has been made is
to be able to enforce it consideration must have been given by him to the promisor
or to some other person at the promisor’s request. These two principles are not
recognized in the same fashion by the jurisprudence of certain Continental
countries or of Scotland, but here they are well established. A third proposition is
that a principal not named in the contract may sue upon it if the promisee really
contracted as his agent. But again, in order to entitle him so to sue, he must have
given consideration either personally or through the promisee, acting as his agent
in giving it.
My Lords, in the case before us, I am of opinion that the consideration, the
allowance of what was in reality part of the discount to which Messrs Dew, the
promisees, were entitled as between themselves and the appellants, was to be
given by Messrs Dew on their own account, and was not in substance, any more
than in form, an allowance made by the appellants …
No doubt it was provided as part of these terms that the appellants should
acquire certain rights, but these rights appear on the face of the contract as jura
quaesita tertio, which the appellants could not enforce. Moreover, even if this
difficulty can be got over by regarding the appellants as the principals of Messrs
Dew in stipulating for the rights in question, the only consideration disclosed by the
contract is one given by Messrs Dew, not as their agents, but as principals acting
on their own account.
The conclusion to which I have come on the point as to consideration renders it
unnecessary to decide the further question as to whether the appellants can claim
that a bargain was made in this contract by Messrs Dew as their agents; a bargain
which, apart from the point as to consideration, they could therefore enforce. If it
1
were necessary to express an opinion on this further question, a difficulty as to the
position of Messrs Dew would have to be considered. Two contracts—one by a
man on his own account as principal, and another by the same man as agent—
may be validly comprised in the same piece of paper. But they must be two
contracts, and not one as here. I do not think that a man can treat one and the
same contract as made by him in two capacities. He cannot be regarded as
contracting for himself and for another uno flatu.
My Lords, the form of the contract which we have to interpret leaves the
appellants in this dilemma, that, if they say that Messrs Dew contracted on their
behalf, they gave no consideration, and if they say they gave consideration in the
shape of a permission to the respondents to buy, they must set up further
stipulations, which are neither to be found in the contract sued upon nor are
germane to it, but are really inconsistent with its structure. That contract has been
reduced to writing, and it is in the writing that we must look for the whole of the
terms made between the parties. These terms cannot, in my opinion consistently
with the settled principles of English law, be construed as giving to the appellants
any enforceable rights as against the respondents.
I think that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was right, and I move that the
appeal be dismissed with costs.
Lord Dunedin
My Lords, I confess that this case is to my mind apt to nip any budding affection
which one might have had for the doctrine of consideration. For the effect of that
doctrine in the present case is to make it possible for a person to snap his fingers
at a bargain deliberately made, a bargain not in itself unfair, and which the person
seeking to enforce it has a legitimate interest to enforce. Notwithstanding these
considerations I cannot say that I have ever had any doubt that the judgment of the
Court of Appeal was right.
My Lords, I am content to adopt from a work of Sir Frederick Pollock, to which I
have often been under obligation, the following words as to consideration: ‘An act
or forbearance of one party, or the promise thereof, is the price for which the
promise of the other is bought, and the promise thus given for value is
enforceable’. (Pollock on Contracts, 8th edn, p. 175.)
Now the agreement sued on is an agreement which on the face of it is an
agreement between Dew and Selfridge. But speaking for myself, I should have no
difficulty in the circumstances of this case in holding it proved that the agreement
was truly made by Dew as agent for Dunlop, or in other words that Dunlop was the
undisclosed principal, and as such can sue on the agreement. None the less, in
order to enforce it he must show consideration, as above defined, moving from
Dunlop to Selfridge.
In the circumstances, how can he do so? The agreement in question is not an
agreement for sale. It is only collateral to an agreement for sale; but that
agreement for sale is an agreement entirely between Dew and Selfridge. The
tyres, the property in which upon the bargain is transferred to Selfridge, were the
property of Dew, not of Dunlop, for Dew under his agreement with Dunlop held
these tyres as proprietor, and not as agent. What then did Dunlop do, or forbear to
do, in a question with Selfridge? The answer must be, nothing. He did not do
anything, for Dew, having the right of property in the tyres, could give a good title to
any one he liked, subject, it might be, to an action of damages at the instance of
Dunlop for breach of contract, which action, however, could never create a vitium
reale in the property of the tyres. He did not forbear in anything, for he had no
action against Dew which he gave up, because Dew had fulfilled his contract with
Dunlop in obtaining, on the occasion of the sale, a contract from Selfridge in the
terms prescribed.
To my mind, this ends the case. That there are methods of framing a contract
which will cause persons in the position of Selfridge to become bound, I do not
doubt. But that has not been done in this instance; and as Dunlop’s advisers must
have known of the law of consideration, it is their affair that they have not so drawn
the contract.
I think the appeal should be dismissed.

Commentary
Dunlop
 
is a case of great significance largely because of Viscount Haldane’s statement
(in the first extracted paragraph of his judgment) to the effect that the rule that only a
person who is a party to a contract can sue upon it is separate and distinct from the
requirements of the doctrine of consideration (a point subsequently affirmed by the
Privy Council in 
Kepong Prospecting Ltd
 
v. 
Schmidt
 
[1968] AC 810). But the fact that
they have their separate existence does not remove the fact that they are closely related
in the sense that the ‘rule that only a party to the agreement can enforce it will often lead
to the same result as the rule that consideration must move from the promisee’ (Treitel,
The Law of Contract
 
(15th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited by Edwin Peel), para 14–
014). The close connection between the two doctrines can be seen in 
Dunlop
 
itself in
that the greater part of the judgments was taken up with the doctrine of consideration.
Indeed, it was the doctrine of consideration that was the object of Lord Dunedin’s wrath.
However, Lord Dunedin may not have been correct in his assertion that the doctrine of
consideration made it possible for Selfridge to snap their fingers at a bargain
deliberately made. While the contract was not enforceable by Dunlop, it does not follow
that it could not have been enforced by Dew. Had Dew sought an injunction to restrain
further breaches of contract by Selfridge it probably would have been successful
(although it would have been more difficult for Dew to have sued Selfridge for damages
because it did not appear to have suffered any loss as a result of the breach and it is
unlikely that, in the state of the law as it was then, it could have recovered damages for
the loss suffered by Dunlop, a third party (on which see 
25.3.2.3
)).
Two further points should be noted about 
Dunlop
. The first is that the aim of Dunlop in
setting up this scheme was to fix the price of its products by setting minimum prices at
which they could be sold. Such price maintenance agreements are now regulated by
statute in the public interest (see generally the Competition Act 1998). But it is
important to note that no point was taken before their Lordships to the effect that the
agreements were invalid on the 
ground that they were contrary to public policy. On the
contrary, their Lordships assumed that price maintenance agreements were in principle
valid and enforceable at common law. It is therefore not possible to confine 
Dunlop
 
on
the basis that the case was concerned with ‘the maintenance of prices to the public
disadvantage’ (as Denning LJ appeared to suggest in 
Smith and Snipes Hall Farm
 
v.
River Douglas Catchment Board
 
[1949] 2 KB 500, 519). As far as their Lordships were
concerned, the failure of Dunlop’s claim had nothing to do with the fact that the public
might have been disadvantaged in any way by Dunlop’s attempt to fix the prices of its
products.
The second point is that Viscount Haldane recognizes that the principle that only a
person who is a party to a contract can sue is not absolute. Two exceptions are apparent
from his judgment (and from the judgment of Lord Dunedin). The first is that it is
possible to confer a right of action upon a third party via a trust. This is an important
point and the device of a trust of a promise has become a recognized exception to the
doctrine of privity, albeit that it operates within narrow limits (on which see 
25.3.3.2
).
The second exception is the doctrine of agency. Thus Viscount Haldane states that ‘a
principal not named in the contract may sue upon it if the promisee really contracted as
his agent’. On the facts of the case, Dunlop was not able to avail itself of the agency
exception because of the finding that the consideration had been supplied by Dew on its
own account and not as agent for Dunlop. But, had Dew acted within the scope of its
authority as an agent for Dunlop in concluding the contract with Selfridge, it would have
resulted in the creation of a contract between Dunlop and Selfridge with the
consequence that Dunlop would have been entitled to bring a claim against Selfridge.
25.3.2
 
The Rights of the Promisee
In both 
Tweddle
 
and 
Dunlop
 
the temptation is to focus attention exclusively on the
position of the third party and the defendant and thereby ignore the position of the
defendant’s contracting party (John Tweddle and Messrs Dew respectively). The
emphasis on the position of the third party and the defendant is understandable given
that they were the parties to the litigation. Nevertheless, sight must not be lost of the
position of the defendant’s contracting party (‘the promisee’). There are at least three
reasons why attention must be paid to the position of the promisee. The first is that the
promisee has paid for the defendant’s promise of performance, whereas the third party
is generally no more than a gratuitous beneficiary of that promise. On this basis it can be
argued that the law’s primary concern should be for the position of the promisee, not the
third party. Secondly, the defendant may have a defence to any claim brought by the
promisee and this defence should also be available to any claim brought by the third
party. 
Tweddle
 
itself may be an example in this category (on the assumption that Lord
Denning was correct in stating that the promisee, John Tweddle, had not carried out his
obligation to pay £100 to his son). Thirdly, there is a temptation to assume that a failure
to provide the third party with a remedy will enable the defendant to break his contract
with impunity. This is not necessarily the case. Proper consideration of the position of
the promisee may lead us to the conclusion that the more appropriate way of providing
redress in respect of the breach is via an action by the promisee rather than by
conferring a right of action on the third party. This is not the place to debate the merits
of conferring a right of action upon the third party (that will come later: 
25.3.5
). It
suffices here to make the point that the rights of the promisee are important and could
even be said to be of greater importance than the rights of the third party.
The rights of the promisee can be broken down into two broad categories. The first
relates to the entitlement of the promisee to a ‘specific remedy’, namely a remedy which
requires 
the defendant specifically to comply with its obligations under the contract. The
form of the remedy will depend upon the nature of the obligation which has been
assumed by the defendant. If the obligation is a positive one, namely to perform a
particular act, the remedy is likely to take the form of a specific performance order (on
which see 
Chapter 24
), that is to say an order of the court that the defendant perform his
obligations in accordance with the terms of the contract. Where, however, the obligation
of the defendant is one not to do a particular thing (for example not to compete with the
third party), the remedy is likely to take the form of an injunction, namely an order of
the court that restrains the defendant from doing the act that he has contracted not to
do (although it may also take the form of a stay of proceedings, discussed in more detail
at 
25.3.2.2
). It is vital to note that the specific remedies are of importance to the third
party as well as to the promisee. Where the promise made by the defendant is one to
confer a benefit on a third party, the effect of the specific performance order will be to
require the defendant to confer the benefit on the third party. In this way the position of
both the promisee and the third party will be protected.
The second right of the promisee relates to its entitlement to recover damages in respect
of the promisor’s breach of contract. The damages remedy may or may not be of
significance to the third party. Where damages are awarded to compensate the promisee
for his own loss then the remedy will be of little significance to the third party. But
where damages are awarded to compensate the promisee for the loss which has been
suffered by the third party, then the remedy is of obvious significance for the third party.
As we shall see, the question whether or not (and, if so, in what circumstances) English
law entitles a contracting party to sue and recover damages in respect of a loss suffered
by a third party is one of some controversy that remains largely unresolved.
Any consideration of the rights of the promisee must therefore distinguish between the
various remedies that are potentially available to the promisee. We shall focus attention
on three of the principal remedies, namely (i) specific performance, (ii) a stay of
proceedings, and (iii) damages.
25.3.2.1
 
Specific Performance
The leading case on the entitlement of the promisee to the remedy of specific
performance is the decision of the House of Lords in 
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswick
 
[1968] AC 58.
However, the significance of 
Beswick
 
transcends this particular issue. The case is of
importance for a number of reasons. First, it evidences the judicial assault that Lord
Denning launched on the doctrine of privity in the middle of the twentieth century. It is
for this reason that an extract has been included from Lord Denning’s judgment in the
Court of Appeal. Secondly, the case illustrates the attitude of the House of Lords to the
doctrine of privity during the same period. While they spoke of the doctrine in critical
terms they did not attempt to abrogate it. Thirdly, Mrs Beswick brought her action in a
dual capacity: first, as the personal representative of her husband (who was the
promisee) and secondly in her own capacity (as third party). The case therefore neatly
illustrates the difference between the legal position of the promisee and the legal
position of the third party. Finally, the case evidences the range of doctrines and
statutory provisions that have been used in the attempt to outflank the doctrine of
privity. A significant part of the judgments in the House of Lords was taken up with an
analysis of section 56(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925. The precise scope of this
subsection has never been established. But the point which was established by the
House of Lords, and which can be seen in the extract from the speech of Lord Reid, is
that the section cannot be used as the foundation for a full-scale assault on the doctrine
of privity in the way that Lord Denning had envisaged in the Court of Appeal.
BESWICK V. BESWICK
[1966] Ch 538, Court of Appeal, [1968] AC 58, House of Lords
In March 1962 Peter Beswick, who was then aged 70 and in poor health, agreed to
sell his coal delivery business to his nephew, John Beswick. On 14 March they
visited a solicitor who drew up an agreement to give effect to their intentions. John
Beswick agreed to employ Peter Beswick as a consultant to the business at £6 10s
a week for the rest of his life and to pay his wife an annuity of £5 a week for her
life, after his death. Peter Beswick’s wife, Ruth, was not a party to the agreement.
In November 1963 Peter Beswick died. John Beswick made one payment of £5 to
Mrs Beswick but refused to make any further payments. Mrs Beswick brought an
action against John Beswick for specific performance of the agreement of March
1962 in her capacity as administratrix of Peter Beswick’s estate and in her
personal capacity. The trial judge refused to make an order for specific
performance. The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal and held that Mrs Beswick
was entitled to enforce the March 1962 agreement by way of specific performance
both in her capacity as administratrix of her husband’s estate and also, by virtue of
section 56(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925, in her personal capacity.
Lord Denning MR
We have here the standard pattern of a contract for the benefit of a third person. A
man has a business or other assets. He transfers them to another and, instead of
taking cash, takes a promise by that other that he will pay an annuity or other sum
to his widow or children. Can the transferee take the assets and reject the
promise? I think not. In my opinion a contract such as this, for the benefit of widow
and children, is binding. The party who makes the promise must honour it, unless
he has some good reason why he should not do so. He may, for instance, be able
to say that the contract should be rescinded as being induced by fraud or
misrepresentation, or that it was varied or rescinded by agreement between the
parties, before the widow or children knew about it and adopted it. But unless he
has some good reason, he is bound. The executor of the dead man can sue to
enforce it on behalf of the widow and children. The widow and children can join
with the executor as plaintiffs in the action. If he refuses to sue, they may sue in
their own names joining him as a defendant. In this way they have a right which
can be enforced. I will prove this by reference to the common law, reinforced by
equity, and now by statute.

The common law
[He considered 
Dutton
 
v. 
Poole
 
(1678) 8 T Raym 302, 2 Lev 210, 1 Vent 318, 332,
3 Keb 786, T Jo 102 and 
Tweddle
 
v. 
Atkinson
 
(1861) 1 B & S 393 and continued]
Those two cases give the key at common law to the whole problem of contracts
for the benefit of a third person. Although the third person cannot as a rule sue
alone in his own name, nevertheless there is no difficulty whatever in the one
contracting party suing the other party for breach of the promise. The third person
should, therefore, bring the action in the name of the contracting party, just as an
assignee used to do. Face to face with the contracting party, the defaulter has no
defence. He is sued by one who has provided consideration and to whom he has
given his promise to pay the third person. He has broken his promise and must
pay damages. The defaulter sometimes seeks to say that the contracting party can
only recover nominal damages because it is not he but the third person who has
suffered the damage. The common law has never allowed the defaulter to escape
by such a shifty means. It holds that the contracting party can recover the money
which should have been paid to the third person. He can get judgment for the sum
and issue a writ of fi. fa. or other machinery to enforce payment: but when he
recovers it, he holds the proceeds for the benefit of the third person. He cannot
retain the money himself because it belongs to the third person and not to him: see
In re Schebsman, Ex parte the Official Solicitor, the Trustee. Cargo
Superintendents (London) Ltd
 
v. 
Schebsman
 
[1944] Ch 83 CA. It is money had and
received to the use of the third person. In 
Robertson
 
v. 
Wait
 
(1853) 8 Exch 299,
301 Martin B said: ‘If a person makes a contract whereby another obtains a
benefit, why may not the former sue for it?’ And in 
Lloyd’s
 
v. 
Harper
 
Lush LJ said
(1880) 16 Ch D 290, 321, CA:
‘I consider it to be an established rule of law that where a contract is made with A for the benefit of B, A
can sue on the contract for the benefit of B and recover all that B could have recovered if the contract
had been made with B himself.’
Such was the position at common law if the action was brought in the name of the
contracting party by himself alone. But nowadays when joinder of parties is freely
permissible, it is far better for the contracting party and the third person to join as
co-plaintiffs. Judgment will be given for the plaintiffs for the amount: and on
payment, it will go at once to the third person who is entitled to it.
2.
 
Equity
Sometimes one of the contracting parties makes the contract on trust for the third
person, in this sense, that from the very beginning the right to sue is vested in him
as trustee for the third person as beneficiary. Such a contract is different from
those we are considering. It cannot be rescinded or varied except with the consent
of the third person beneficiary: see 
In re Empress Engineering Co
 
(1880) 16 Ch D
125. In such a case it is clearly established that the third person himself can sue in
equity to enforce the contract: see 
Tomlinson
 
v. 
Gill
 
(1756) Amb 330 and 
Gregory
v. 
Williams
 
(1817) 3 Mer 582; but even so, he ought as a rule to join the trustee as
a party. Here we have a case where there is admittedly no trust of the contractual
right. Peter Beswick and his nephew might by agreement before his death have
rescinded or varied the agreement, if they so wished. Nevertheless, although there
is no trust, I do not think equity is powerless. It has in its hands the potent remedy
of ordering a party specifically to perform his contract. If a party makes a promise
to pay money to a third person, I see no reason why a court of equity should not
order him to perform his promise. The action must be brought, of course, in the
name of the other contracting party; but, that being done, there is no bar to a
decree for specific performance being made. True it is for the payment of money,
but a court of equity often decrees specific performance of a promise to pay
money. It can enforce it by the appointment of a receiver, or other appropriate
machinery …
These cases in equity fit in exactly with the common law. The contracting party
is entitled by himself alone, or jointly with the third person, to have the contract
performed according to its terms, and the court will decree specific performance of
it.
3.
 
Statute
Section 56(1) of the Law of Property Act, 1925, says that
‘A person may take an immediate or other interest in land or other property, or the benefit of any
condition, right of entry, covenant or agreement over or respecting land or other property, although he
may not be named as a party to the conveyance or other instrument’:
and by section 205(1)(xx) ‘“Property” includes any thing in action, and any interest
in real or personal property’. Apply that section to this case. The promise of the
nephew to pay the widow £5 a week was a ‘thing in action’: for the simple reason
that it could be enforced by action, namely, an action by the contracting party. This
section says, as clearly as can be, that the widow can take the benefit of the
agreement, although she is not named as a party to it. Seeing that she is to take
the benefit of it, she must be able to sue for it, if not by herself alone, at least jointly
with the contracting party. Otherwise the section is made of no effect. Ubi jus, ibi
remedium.
 
If there was, therefore, any doubt as to her ability to sue at common
law or equity, that doubt is removed by this section.

Conclusion
The general rule undoubtedly is that ‘no third person can sue, or be sued, on a
contract to which he is not a party’: but at bottom that is only a rule of procedure. It
goes to the form of remedy, not to the underlying right. Where a contract is made
for the benefit of a third person who has a legitimate interest to enforce it, it can be
enforced by the third person in the name of the contracting party or jointly with him
or, if he refuses to join, by adding him as a defendant. In that sense, and it is a
very real sense, the third person has a right arising by way of contract. He has an
interest which will be protected by law. … It is different when a third person has no
legitimate interest, as when he is seeking to enforce the maintenance of prices to
the public disadvantage, as in 
Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd
 
v. 
Selfridge & Co Ltd
[1915] AC 847, 853, HL(E): or when he is seeking to rely, not on any right given to
him by the contract, but on an exemption clause seeking to exempt himself from
his just liability. He cannot set up an exemption clause in a contract to which he
was not a party: see 
Midland Silicones Ltd
 
v. 
Scruttons Ltd
 
[1962] AC 446, HL(E).
The widow here sues in her capacity as executrix of her husband’s estate (and
therefore as contracting party), and also in her personal capacity (and therefore as
a third person). This joint claim is clearly good. She is entitled to an order for
specific performance of the agreement, by ordering the defendant to pay the
arrears of £175, and the instalments of £5 a week as they fall due … When the
money is recovered, it will go to the widow for her own benefit, and not to her
husband’s estate.
Danckwerts LJ
 
delivered a concurring judgment while 
Salmon LJ
 
agreed that
Mrs Beswick was entitled to a specific performance order in her capacity as
administratrix of her husband’s estate but left open the question of her entitlement
to a remedy under section 56(1) of the 1925 Act.
John Beswick appealed to the House of Lords. The House of Lords affirmed the decision
of the Court of Appeal in so far as it held that Mrs Beswick (‘the respondent’) was
entitled to enforce the March 1962 agreement in her capacity as administratrix of her
husband’s estate. But their Lordships held that she was not entitled to enforce the
agreement in her personal capacity under section 56(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925.
Lord Reid
[set out the facts and continued]
For clarity I think it best to begin by considering a simple case where, in consideration of a sale by A to B, B
agrees to pay the price of £1,000 to a third party X. Then the first question 
appears to me to be whether the
parties intended that X should receive the money simply as A’s nominee so that he would hold the money for
behoof of A and be accountable to him for it, or whether the parties intended that X should receive the money
for his own behoof and be entitled to keep it. That appears to me to be a question of construction of the
agreement read in light of all the circumstances which were known to the parties. There have been several
decisions involving this question. I am not sure that any conflicts with the view which I have expressed. … In the
present case I think it clear that the parties to the agreement intended that the respondent should receive the
weekly sums of £5 in her own behoof and should not be accountable to her deceased husband’s estate for them.
Indeed the contrary was not argued.
Reverting to my simple example the next question appears to me to be: Where the intention was that X
should keep the £1,000 as his own, what is the nature of B’s obligation and who is entitled to enforce it? It was
not argued that the law of England regards B’s obligation as a nullity, and I have not observed in any of the
authorities any suggestion that it would be a nullity. There may have been a time when the existence of a right
depended on whether there was any means of enforcing it, but today the law would be sadly deficient if one
found that, although there is a right, the law provides no means for enforcing it. So this obligation of B must be
enforceable either by X or by A. I shall leave aside for the moment the question whether section 56(1) of the Law
of Property Act, 1925, has any application to such a case, and consider the position at common law.
Lord Denning’s view, expressed in this case not for the first time, is that X could enforce this obligation. But
the view more commonly held in recent times has been that such a contract confers no right on X and that X
could not sue for the £1,000. Leading counsel for the respondent based his case on other grounds, and as I
agree that the respondent succeeds on other grounds, this would not be an appropriate case in which to solve
this question. It is true that a strong Law Revision Committee recommended so long ago as 1937 (Cmd 5449):
‘That where a contract by its express terms purports to confer a benefit directly on a third party it shall be
enforceable by the third party in his own name …’ (p. 31).
And, if one had to contemplate a further long period of Parliamentary procrastination, this House might find it
necessary to deal with this matter. But if legislation is probable at any early date I would not deal with it in a
case where that is not essential. So for the purposes of this case I shall proceed on the footing that the
commonly accepted view is right.
What then is A’s position? I assume that A has not made himself a trustee for X, because it was not argued in
this appeal that any trust had been created. So, if X has no right, A can at any time grant a discharge to B or
make some new contract with B. If there were a trust the position would be different. X would have an equitable
right and A would be entitled and, indeed, bound to recover the money and account for it to X. And A would
have no right to grant a discharge to B. If there is no trust and A wishes to enforce the obligation, how does he
set about it? He cannot sue B for the £1,000 because under the contract the money is not payable to him, and, if
the contract were performed according to its terms, he would never have any right to get the money. So he must
seek to make B pay X.
The argument for the appellant is that A’s only remedy is to sue B for damages for B’s breach of contract in
failing to pay the £1,000 to X. Then the appellant says that A can only recover nominal damages of 40s. because
the fact that X has not received the money will generally cause no loss to A: he admits that there may be cases
where A would suffer damage if X did not receive the money but says that the present is not such a case.
Applying what I have said to the circumstances of the present case, the respondent in her personal capacity
has no right to sue, but she has a right as administratrix of her husband’s 
estate to require the appellant to
perform his obligation under the agreement. He has refused to do so and he maintains that the respondent’s
only right is to sue him for damages for breach of his contract.
If that were so, I shall assume that he is right in maintaining that the administratrix could then only recover
nominal damages because his breach of contract has caused no loss to the estate of her deceased husband.
If that were the only remedy available the result would be grossly unjust. It would mean that the appellant
keeps the business which he bought and for which he has only paid a small part of the price which he agreed to
pay. He would avoid paying the rest of the price, the annuity to the respondent, by paying a mere 40s. damages.
The respondent’s first answer is that the common law has been radically altered by section 56(1) of the Law
of Property Act, 1925, and that that section entitles her to sue in her personal capacity and recover the benefit
provided for her in the agreement although she was not a party to it. Extensive alterations of the law were made
at that time but it is necessary to examine with some care the way in which this was done. That Act was a
consolidation Act and it is the invariable practice of Parliament to require from those who have prepared a
consolidation Bill an assurance that it will make no substantial change in the law and to have that checked by a
committee [he considered the legislative history of the section and continued] … it is therefore quite certain that
those responsible for the preparation of this legislation must have believed and intended that section 56 would
make no substantial change in the earlier law, and equally certain that Parliament passed section 56 in reliance
on an assurance that it did make no substantial change.
Section 56 was obviously intended to replace section 5 of the Real Property Act, 1845 (8 and 9 Vict. c. 106).
That section provided:
‘That, under an indenture, executed after October 1, 1845, an immediate estate or interest, in any
tenements or hereditaments, and the benefit of a condition or covenant, respecting any tenements or
hereditaments, may be taken, although the taker thereof be not named a party to the same indenture … ’
Section 56 (1) now provides:
[He set out the subsection, in the extract from Lord Denning earlier in this subsection and continued]
If the matter stopped there it would not be difficult to hold that section 56 does not substantially extend or
alter the provisions of section 5 of the Act of 1845. But more difficulty is introduced by the definition section of
the Act of 1925 (section 205) which provides:
‘(1) In this Act unless the context otherwise requires, the following expressions have the meanings hereby
assigned to them respectively, that is to say:- … (xx) “Property” includes any thing in action, and any
interest in real or personal property.’
… If application of [the definition of ‘property’] would result in giving to section 56 a meaning going beyond that
of the old section, then, in my opinion, the context does require that the definition of ‘property’ shall not be
applied to that word in section 56. The context in which this section occurs is a consolidation Act. If the
definition is not applied the section is a proper one to appear in such an Act because it can properly be regarded
as not substantially altering the pre-existing law. But if the definition is applied the result is to make section 56
go far beyond the pre-existing law. Holding that the section has such an effect would involve holding that the
invariable practice of Parliament has been departed from 
per incuriam
 
so that something has got into this
consolidation Act which neither the draftsman nor Parliament can have intended to be there. … For these
reasons I am of opinion that section 56 has no application to the present case.
The respondent’s second argument is that she is entitled in her capacity of administratrix of her deceased
husband’s estate to enforce the provision of the agreement for the benefit of herself in her personal capacity,
and that a proper way of enforcing that provision is to order specific performance. That would produce a just
result, and, unless there is some technical objection, I am of opinion that specific performance ought to be
ordered. For the reasons given by your Lordships I would reject the arguments submitted for the appellant that
specific performance is not a possible remedy in this case.
Lord Pearce
My Lords, if the annuity had been payable to a third party in the lifetime of Beswick senior and there had been
default, he could have sued in respect of the breach. His administratrix is now entitled to stand in his shoes and
to sue in respect of the breach which has occurred since his death.
It is argued that the estate can only recover nominal damages and that no other remedy is open, either to the
estate or to the personal plaintiff. Such a result would be wholly repugnant to justice and commonsense. And if
the argument were right it would show a very serious defect in the law.
In the first place, I do not accept the view that damages must be nominal. Lush LJ in 
Lloyd’s
 
v. 
Harper
(1880) 16 Ch D 290, 321 said:
‘Then the next question which, no doubt, is a very important and substantial one, is, that Lloyd’s, having
sustained no damage themselves, could not recover for the losses sustained by third parties by reason of
the default of Robert Henry Harper as an underwriter. That, to my mind, is a startling and alarming
doctrine, and a novelty, because I consider it to be an established rule of law that where a contract is made
with A for the benefit of B, A can sue on the contract for the benefit of B, and recover all that B could have
recovered if the contract had been made with B himself.’
… I agree with the comment of Windeyer J in the case of 
Coulls
 
v. 
Bagot’s Executor
 
and 
Trustee Co Ltd
(1967) 40 ALJR 471, 486 in the High Court of Australia that the words of Lush LJ cannot be accepted without
qualification and regardless of context and also with his statement:
‘I can see no reason why in such cases the damages which A would suffer upon B’s breach of his contract
to pay C $500 would be merely nominal: I think that in accordance with the ordinary rules for the
assessment of damages for breach of contract they could be substantial. They would not necessarily be
$500; they could I think be less or more.’
In the present case I think that the damages, if assessed, must be substantial. It is not necessary, however, to
consider the amount of damages more closely since this is a case in which, as the Court of Appeal rightly
decided, the more appropriate remedy is that of specific performance.
The administratrix is entitled, if she so prefers, to enforce the agreement rather than accept its repudiation,
and specific performance is more convenient than an action for arrears of payment followed by separate actions
as each sum falls due. Moreover, damages for breach would be a less appropriate remedy since the parties to the
agreement were intending an annuity for a widow; and a lump sum of damages does not accord with this. And if
(contrary to my view) the argument that a derisory sum of damages is all that can be obtained be right, the
remedy of damages in this case is manifestly useless.
The present case presents all the features which led the equity courts to apply their remedy of specific
performance. The contract was for the sale of a business. The defendant could on his part clearly have obtained
specific performance of it if Beswick senior or his administratrix had defaulted. Mutuality is a ground in favour
of specific performance.
Moreover, the defendant on his side has received the whole benefit of the contract and it is a matter of
conscience for the court to see that he now performs his part of it …
In my opinion, the plaintiff as administratrix is entitled to a decree of specific performance.
[He then considered the widow’s claim at common law and under section 56(1) of the Law of Property Act
1925 and concluded that the widow had a claim on neither basis].
Lord Upjohn
, 
Lord Hodson
, and 
Lord Guest
 
delivered concurring speeches in which they held that Mrs
Beswick was entitled to a specific performance order in her capacity as administratrix of her husband’s estate
but not in her personal capacity.
Commentary
A number of points of significance emerge from the decision of the House of Lords in
Beswick
. The first group of points relates to the failure of Mrs Beswick’s claim in her
personal capacity. It should be noted that in the House of Lords counsel for Mrs Beswick
did not attempt to support Lord Denning’s view that Mrs Beswick was entitled to
succeed in her claim at common law, apart from section 56 of the Law of Property Act
1925. Their Lordships were therefore not asked to engage in a re-examination of the
doctrine of privity. In relation to section 56, their Lordships held that it did not have the
effect which Lord Denning attributed to it. But its precise scope remains uncertain.
Treitel comments (
The Law of Contract
 
(15th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited by
Edwin Peel), para 14–146):
[T]here is support in 
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswick
 
for four limitations on its scope: namely, that it applies only (1) to real
property, (2) to covenants running with the land; (3) to cases where the instrument is not merely for the benefit
of the third party but purports to contain a grant to or covenant with him; and (4) to deeds strictly inter partes.
But there is no clear majority in the speeches in favour of all, some or even one of these limitations, so that the
scope of the subsection remains obscure.
The conclusion that Mrs Beswick was not entitled to a specific performance order in her
own capacity gives rise to apparent anomalies. Had the executor of Peter Beswick’s
estate been someone other than Mrs Beswick, she would not have been entitled to a
specific performance order, nor would she have been able to compel the executor to seek
a specific performance order. It would have been for the executor himself to decide
whether or not to seek a remedy and, if so, which remedy. On the other hand, it can be
argued that there is no anomaly here. The remedy belonged to the estate (on the ground
that Peter Beswick provided the consideration for the promise of his nephew), not Mrs
Beswick, and the same remedies would have been available whoever happened to be the
administrator of the estate.
The second group of points relates to the conclusion that Mrs Beswick was entitled to a
specific performance order in her capacity as administratrix of her husband’s estate.
What factors were relied upon by Lord Pearce to support the conclusion that a specific
performance order was the most appropriate remedy on the facts of the case? Lord
Upjohn stated that damages were ‘inadequate to meet the justice of the case’. Why was
this so? Damages may have been an inadequate remedy to protect the interests of Mrs
Beswick in her own capacity but she was not suing in that capacity. She was suing as the
representative of the estate and on what basis could it be said that damages were an
inadequate or inappropriate remedy for the estate?
Finally, what would have been the position if the contract had not been specifically
enforceable? It was not necessary for their Lordships to decide this particular point
given that they concluded that the contract was specifically enforceable. But it is worth
noting that Lord Pearce was of the view that the estate would have been entitled to
substantial damages, while the rest of their Lordships were content to assume that
damages would have been nominal. Which view is the correct one?
25.3.2.2
 
Stay of Proceedings
Where the promise made by the promisor is a promise not to sue a third party, the
promisee may be able to seek a stay of the promisor’s action against the third party
under section 49(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 which states:
Nothing in this Act shall affect the power of the Court of Appeal or the High Court to stay any proceedings
before it, where it thinks fit to do so, either of its own motion or on the application of any person, whether or
not a party to the proceedings.
In order to obtain a stay the promisee must demonstrate that the promisor has
promised not to sue the third party and that the promisee has a sufficient interest in the
enforcement of the promisor’s promise to justify the grant of a stay. A case in which
these requirements were not satisfied is 
Gore
 
v. 
Van Der Lann
 
[1967] 2 QB 31. The
plaintiff fell when attempting to board a bus operated by Liverpool Corporation. She
brought an action in negligence against the bus conductor who was an employee of the
corporation. The corporation applied to stay her action. The basis for their application
was that the plaintiff had applied for a free bus pass from the corporation and in doing
so had signed an application form which stated that the pass was issued ‘subject to the
conditions that neither the Liverpool Corporation nor any of their servants or agents
responsible for the driving, management, control or working of their bus system, are to
be liable to the holder … for … injury … however caused’. It was held that the
corporation was not entitled to the stay. The Court of Appeal held that the condition
relied upon by the corporation was caught by section 151 of the Road Traffic Act 1960
and was consequently invalid.
 
But in any event it was held that the corporation was not
entitled to the stay because (i) the plaintiff had not promised not to sue the bus
conductor (although one might wish to argue that the exemption clause in the bus pass
ought to have been treated as a promise not to sue) and (ii) the corporation did not have
a sufficient interest in the enforcement of any such promise (had it been made) because
it was not under an obligation to indemnify its employee against his liability to the
plaintiff in negligence.
A different result was reached in 
Snelling
 
v. 
John G Snelling Ltd
 
[1973] 1 QB 87. Three
brothers were directors of a family company and they were all owed substantial sums of
money by the company. Differences arose between the brothers and, in an attempt to
resolve them, they entered into an agreement under which they agreed that if one of
them resigned his directorship he should ‘forfeit’ all monies due to him from the
company. The plaintiff resigned his directorship and brought an action to recover the
sums owed to him by the 
company. The company sought to rely on the terms of the
agreement between the brothers as a defence to the claim. The plaintiff’s two brothers
then applied to be joined as defendants to the claim and they adopted the defence of the
company and counterclaimed for a declaration that the sum due to the plaintiff by the
company had been forfeited. Ormrod J dismissed the plaintiff’s claim and gave
judgment for the two brothers on their counterclaim. On what basis did he dismiss the
plaintiff’s claim? It is important to distinguish here between the position of the company
and the position of the two brothers who were joined as defendants. The company was,
as Ormrod J stated (at p. 96), ‘not entitled to rely directly on the terms of the contract’.
But the brothers were entitled to judgment on their counterclaim against the plaintiff.
3
This being the case, Ormrod J continued (at pp. 96–97):
[T]o give judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant company for the amount claimed in the statement of
claim and judgment for the second and third defendants on the counterclaim would be absurd, unless, which is
clearly not the case here, the second and third defendants could be adequately compensated in damages. So far
as they are concerned a judgment against the company would frustrate the very purpose for which their
agreement with the plaintiff was made. The next problem is to consider the relief to which they are entitled.
They have claimed a declaration that the amount shown in the plaintiff’s loan account has been forfeited to the
defendant company and is now applicable in accordance with the resolution of the board of directors of the
defendant company passed on May 22, 1969, but I feel some doubt whether this is the appropriate form of
declaration. They are certainly entitled to a declaration that the provisions in the agreement of March 22, 1968,
are binding on the plaintiff. Had these provisions been worded positively and not negatively, e.g., as a promise
by the resigning director to release the company from its indebtedness to him, I think that, on the authority of
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswick
 
[1968] AC 58, this would have been an appropriate case on the facts in which to order
specific performance of that promise in whatever was the appropriate form. Similarly, had the second and third
defendants themselves taken proceedings, before the plaintiff issued his writ, to restrain the anticipated breach
they would have been entitled to an injunction restraining him from demanding payment by the company of his
loan account. Had he subsequently started an action against the company it would, presumably, have been
stayed as an abuse of the process of the court. But what is the appropriate form of order when the second and
third defendants have been joined in the plaintiff’s action, and succeeded on the counterclaim? … In my
judgment … the second and third defendants have made out an unambiguous case and have shown that the
interests of justice require that the plaintiff be not permitted to recover against the defendant company. It
follows that this is a proper case in which to grant a stay of all further proceedings in the plaintiff’s action
against the company.
[Counsel for the defendants], however, has submitted that he is entitled to go further and ask for the
plaintiff’s claim against the company to be dismissed …
[He considered the submission and concluded]
… I am inclined to the view that in a case such as this where the promisees under the agreement and the
party to be benefited by the agreement are all before the court and the promisees have succeeded against the
plaintiff on their counterclaim, the right view is that the plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed. … If the action
was left with no more than an order staying further proceedings on the claim, the plaintiff could start another
action only to have it also stayed and so on ad infinitum. The reality of the matter is that the plaintiff’s claim
fails and the order of the court ought, if possible, clearly to reflect that fact.
Accordingly, I think the plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed and that there should be judgment for the
second and third defendants on the counterclaim, together with a declaration in appropriate terms.
The approach of Ormrod J is less restrictive than that adopted by the Court of Appeal in
Gore
 
in that he dismissed the plaintiff’s claim notwithstanding the fact the two brothers
were not under any obligation to indemnify the company in respect of its liability to the
plaintiff. Ormrod J took a broad view of the situation and concluded that the interest
which the brothers had in the running of the family company was sufficient to give them
an interest in obtaining a stay (and, indeed, the dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim).
25.3.2.3
 
Damages
Finally, the promisee may seek a remedy in damages from the promisor. The promisee is
clearly entitled to sue and recover damages in respect of the loss that he has suffered as
a result of the breach. Take the case where the promisee is a debtor of the third party
and the promisor has promised to pay a sum of money to the third party in order to
discharge the promisee’s liability to the third party. The promisor fails to make the
promised payment to the third party. The consequence is that the promisee remains
indebted to the third party and, to that extent, the promisee does suffer loss as a result
of the failure of the promisor to make the payment to the third party. But in other cases
the promisee is likely to find it difficult to prove that he has suffered loss as a result of
the promisor’s breach. 
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswick
 
[1968] AC 58 is a case in point. It was
assumed by all of their Lordships, with the exception of Lord Pearce, that Mrs Beswick
only had a claim for nominal damages in her capacity as administratrix of her husband’s
estate. The reason for this was that the estate did not appear to have suffered any loss as
a result of John Beswick’s breach of contract. Lord Pearce made no such assumption: in
his opinion the estate was entitled to ‘substantial’ damages. It is not necessary for us to
resolve this point here. It has already been discussed in the chapter on damages (see
23.3
). It suffices to note that the ability of the promisee to recover damages for his own
loss depends on whether or not he has suffered a loss as a result of the promisor’s
breach of contract.
The party who is more likely to have suffered loss as a result of the breach is the third
party. Can the promisee sue and recover damages in respect of the third party’s loss?
The general rule is that he cannot. He can only recover damages in respect of his own
loss. The existence of this general rule was affirmed by the House of Lords in 
Alfred
McAlpine Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Panatown Ltd
 
[2001] 1 AC 518. The three judges in the
majority all accepted the existence of the general rule (see Lord Clyde at p. 522, Lord
Jauncey at p. 563, and Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p. 575), but it is in the speeches of the
dissentients, Lord Goff and Lord Millett, that we find more extended analysis of both the
basis for the general rule and the criticisms that have been levelled against it. Lord
Millett (at p. 580) defended the general rule in the following terms:
Compensation is compensation for loss; its object is to make good a loss. It is inherent in the concept of
compensation that only the person who has suffered the loss is entitled to have it made good by compensation.
Compensation for a third party’s loss is a contradiction in terms. It is impossible on any logical basis to justify
the recovery of compensatory damages by a person who has not suffered the loss in respect of which they are
awarded unless he is accountable for them to the person who has.
Lord Goff, on the other hand, was more sceptical. He doubted the existence of the
general rule. He stated (at pp. 538–539 and p. 544):
It would be an extraordinary defect in our law if, where (for example) A enters into a contract with B that B
should carry out work for the benefit of a third party, C, A should have no remedy in damages against B if B
should perform his contract in a defective manner. Contracts in this form are a commonplace of everyday life,
very often in the context of the family; but, as the present case shows, they may also occur in a commercial
context. It is not surprising therefore to discover that the authority for the supposed rule which excludes such a
right to damages is very thin, and that its existence has been doubted by distinguished writers. … Plainly it is
right that a contracting party should not use the remedy of damages to recover what has been described by
Oliver J in a notable judgment in 
Radford
 
v. 
De Froberville
 
[1977] 1 WLR 1262, 1270 as ‘an uncovenanted
profit’, or indeed to impose on the other contracting party an uncovenanted burden. But if the supposed rule
exists, it could deprive a contracting party of any effective remedy in the case of a contract which is intended to
confer a benefit on a third party but not to confer on the third party an enforceable right. It is not surprising
therefore to discover increasing concern on the part of scholars specialising in the law of contract that the
supposed rule, if rigidly applied, can have the effect of depriving parties of the fulfilment of their reasonable
contractual expectations, and to read of doubts on their part whether any such rule exists.
Given that the majority in 
Panatown
 
accepted the existence of the general rule, Lord
Millett’s view would appear to be the correct one as a matter of authority. Nevertheless,
the concerns of Lord Goff are reflected in the exceptions to the general rule and in the
case-law more generally. He points out that the general rule can cause problems both in
the family and in the commercial context. Before giving brief consideration to the
exceptions to the general rule it may be useful to examine two cases in which the general
rule has given rise to difficulty. The first case, 
Jackson
 
v. 
Horizon Holidays Ltd
 
[1975] 1
WLR 1468, is drawn from the family context, while the second, 
Woodar Investment
Development Ltd
 
v. 
Wimpey Construction UK Ltd
 
[1980] 1 WLR 277, is a commercial
case.
JACKSON V. HORIZON HOLIDAYS LTD
[1975] 1 WLR 1468, Court of Appeal
Julian Jackson booked a holiday for himself, his wife, and his three-year-old sons
at the Pegasus Reef Hotel, Sri Lanka through Horizon Holidays Ltd, a travel
company. Before making the booking Jackson set out his precise requirements
regarding accommodation, food, amenities, and facilities in a letter to Horizon and
was assured by Horizon that they would be met. The price payable was £1,432.
Soon afterwards, Horizon informed Jackson that the Pegasus Reef Hotel would
not be ready in time and offered him accommodation at the Brown’s Beach Hotel
for £1,200 instead. Jackson agreed after an assurance from Horizon that the hotel
would be up to his expectations. The accommodation, food, amenities, and
facilities at the Brown’s Beach Hotel were unsatisfactory and the whole family
suffered distress and inconvenience. Jackson brought an action against Horizon
claiming damages for misrepresentation and breach of contract. Judge Edgar Fay
QC awarded Jackson damages of £1,100. Horizon appealed on the ground that
the damages awarded were excessive. The Court of Appeal refused to interfere
with Judge Fay’s award and dismissed the appeal.
Lord Denning MR
[set out the facts and continued]
The judge did not divide up the £1,100. Counsel has made suggestions about
it. Counsel for Horizon Holidays suggests that the judge gave £100 for diminution
in value and £1,000 for the mental distress. But counsel for Mr Jackson suggested
that the judge gave £600 for the diminution in value and £500 for the mental
distress. If I were inclined myself to speculate, I think the suggestion of counsel for
Mr Jackson may well be right. The judge took the cost of the holidays at £1,200.
The family only had about half the value of it. Divide it by two and you get £600.
Then add £500 for the mental distress.
On this question a point of law arises. The judge said that he could only
consider the mental distress to Mr Jackson himself, and that he could not consider
the distress to his wife and children. He said:
‘The damages are the plaintiff’s. … I can consider the effect upon his mind of the wife’s discomfort,
vexation, and the like, although I cannot award a sum which represents her own vexation.’ …
We have had an interesting discussion as to the legal position when one person
makes a contract for the benefit of a third party. In this case it was a husband
making a contract for the benefit of himself, his wife and children. Other cases
readily come to mind. A host makes a contract with a restaurant for a dinner for
himself and his friends. The vicar makes a contract for a coach trip for the choir. In
all these cases there is only one person who makes the contract. It is the husband,
the host or the vicar, as the case may be. Sometimes he pays the whole price
himself. Occasionally he may get a contribution from the others. But in any case it
is he who makes the contract. It would be a fiction to say that the contract was
made by all the family, or all the guests, or all the choir, and that he was only an
agent for them. Take this very case. It would be absurd to say that the twins of
three years old were parties to the contract or that the father was making the
contract on their behalf as if they were principals. It would equally be a mistake to
say that in any of these instances there was a trust. The transaction bears no
resemblance to a trust. There was no trust fund and no trust property. No, the real
truth is that in each instance, the father, the host or the vicar, was making a
contract himself for the benefit of the whole party. In short, a contract by one for the
benefit of third persons.
What is the position when such a contract is broken? At present the law says
that the only one who can sue is the one who made the contract. None of the rest
of the party can sue, even though the contract was made for their benefit. But
when that one does sue, what damages can he recover? Is he limited to his own
loss? Or can he recover for the others? Suppose the holiday firm puts the family
into a hotel which is only half built and the visitors have to sleep on the floor? Or
suppose the restaurant is fully booked and the guests have to go away, hungry and
angry, having spent so much on fares to get there? Or suppose the coach leaves
the choir stranded halfway and they have to hire cars to get home? None of them
individually can sue. Only the father, the host or the vicar can sue. He can, of
course, recover his own damages. But can he not recover for the others? I think he
can. The case comes within the principle stated by Lush LJ in 
Lloyd’s
 
v. 
Harper
(1880) 16 Ch D 290, 321:
‘I consider it to be an established rule of law that where a contract is made with A for the benefit of B, A
can sue on the contract for the benefit of B, and recover all that B could have recovered if the contract
had been made with B himself.’
It has been suggested that Lush LJ was thinking of a contract in which A was
trustee for B. But I do not think so. He was a common lawyer speaking of common
law. His words were quoted with considerable approval by Lord Pearce in 
Beswick
v. 
Beswick
 
[1968] AC 58, 88. I have myself often quoted them. I think they should
be accepted as correct, at any rate so long as the law forbids the third persons
themselves from suing for damages. It is the only way in which a just result can be
achieved. Take the instance I have put. The guests ought to recover from the
restaurant their wasted fares. The choir ought to recover the cost of hiring the taxis
home. Then is no one to recover for them except the one who made the contract
for their benefit? He should be able to recover the expense to which he has been
put, and pay it over to them. Once recovered, it will be money had and received to
their use. (They might even, if desired, be joined as plaintiffs.) If he can recover for
the expense, he should also be able to recover for the discomfort, vexation and
upset which the whole party have suffered by reason of the breach of contract,
recompensing them accordingly out of what he recovers.
Applying the principles to this case, I think that the figure of £1,100 was about
right. It would, I think, have been excessive if it had been awarded only for the
damage suffered by Mr Jackson himself. But when extended to his wife and
children, I do not think it is excessive. People look forward to a holiday. They
expect the promises to be fulfilled. When it fails, they are greatly disappointed and
upset. It is difficult to assess in terms of money; but it is the task of the judges to do
the best they can. I see no reason to interfere with the total award of £1,100. I
would therefore dismiss the appeal.
Orr LJ
I agree.
James LJ
In this case Mr Jackson, as found by the judge on the evidence, was in need of a
holiday at the end of 1970. He was able to afford a holiday for himself and his
family. According to the form he completed, which was the form of Horizon
Holidays Ltd, he booked what was a family holiday. The wording of that form might
in certain circumstances give rise to a contract in which the person signing the
form is acting as his own principal and as agent for others. In the circumstances of
this case, as indicated by Lord Denning MR, it would be wholly unrealistic to
regard this contract as other than one made by Mr Jackson for a family holiday.
The judge found that he did not get a family holiday. The costs were some £1,200.
When he came back he felt no benefit. His evidence was to the effect that, without
any exaggeration, he felt terrible. He said: ‘The only thing, I was pleased to be
back, very pleased, but I had nothing at all from that holiday’. For my part, on the
issue of damages in this matter, I am quite content to say that £1,100 awarded was
the right and proper figure in those circumstances. I would dismiss the appeal.
Commentary
The Court of Appeal held that Mr Jackson was entitled to £1,100 by way of damages. But
on what basis? Lord Denning was clearly of the view that £1,100 was excessive if it was
awarded solely in respect of the loss suffered by Mr Jackson but that it was nevertheless
justifiable on the basis that Mr Jackson was entitled to recover damages on behalf of his
family in respect of the loss which they had all suffered. Thus in his view Mr Jackson’s
claim was not one for his own loss but for the loss suffered by third parties (namely the
members of his family). 
The judgment of James LJ is short but it would appear that he
was content to uphold the award of the trial judge who awarded damages on the basis
that the sum awarded was solely in respect of the loss suffered by Mr Jackson. So it
would appear that James LJ was of the view that damages were awarded in respect of
Mr Jackson’s loss and not the loss suffered by members of his family. Given this
apparent judicial division of opinion as to the basis on which damages were awarded to
Mr Jackson, the judgment of Orr LJ assumes considerable significance. But what is the
meaning to be ascribed to his two-word judgment? Did he agree with the substance of
Lord Denning’s judgment or did he simply agree with his conclusion that the appeal
should be dismissed? It is impossible to give a definitive answer to this question and,
this being the case, 
Jackson
 
cannot be regarded as unequivocal authority for the
proposition that a contracting party can sue and recover damages in respect of a loss
suffered by a third party to the contract. Although the 
ratio
 
of the case is unclear, the
result is not and it was accepted by the House of Lords in 
Woodar Investment
Development Ltd
 
v. 
Wimpey Construction UK Ltd
 
[1980] 1 WLR 277 and by Lord Goff
and Lord Millett in 
Panatown.
One final point should be noted about 
Jackson
. A common concern that emerges from
the speeches of Lords Goff and Millett in 
Panatown
 
(at p. 544) is that the contracting
party should not be entitled to recover an ‘uncovenanted profit’. In so far as damages are
awarded to the claimant in respect of the loss suffered by the third party, the claimant
should be required to account for them to the third party. Lord Denning was alive to this
problem. Thus he stated that the contracting party was accountable to the third parties
by means of an action for ‘money had and received to their use’ (in other words, a
personal restitutionary claim) for the damages received in respect of the loss suffered by
the third parties.
Turning now to the commercial context, our illustrative case is:
WOODAR INVESTMENT DEVELOPMENT LTD V. WIMPEY
CONSTRUCTION UK LTD
[1980] 1 WLR 277, House of Lords
Wimpey agreed to buy land from Woodar. The contract stated that the purchase
price was £850,000 but it further provided that upon completion of the purchase
Wimpey should pay a further £150,000 to Transworld Trade Ltd (‘Transworld’).
Woodar alleged that Wimpey had committed a repudiatory breach of the contract
and they claimed damages from Wimpey which included the £150,000 that
Wimpey had agreed to pay to Transworld. The House of Lords held that Wimpey
had not repudiated the contract and, this being the case, it was not necessary to
decide whether or not Woodar were entitled to recover damages in respect of the
money payable to Transworld. Nevertheless, their Lordships did consider the
entitlement of Woodar to recover damages in the following terms.
Lord Wilberforce
[referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Jackson
 
v. 
Horizon Holidays Ltd
and continued]
I am not prepared to dissent from the actual decision in that case. It may be
supported either as a broad decision on the measure of damages (per James LJ)
or possibly as an example of a type of contract, examples of which are persons
contracting for family holidays, ordering meals in restaurants for a party, hiring a
taxi for a group, calling for special treatment. As I suggested in 
New Zealand
Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
A M Satterthwaite & Co Ltd (The Eurymedon)
 
[1975] AC 154,
167, there are many situations of daily life which do not fit neatly 
into conceptual
analysis, but which require some flexibility in the law of contract. 
Jackson
’s case
may well be one.
I cannot however agree with the basis on which Lord Denning MR put his
decision in that case. The extract on which he relied from the judgment of Lush LJ
in 
Lloyd’s
 
v. 
Harper
 
… was part of a passage in which the Lord Justice was stating
as an ‘established rule of law’ that an agent … may sue on a contract made by him
on behalf of the principal … if the contract gives him such a right, and is no
authority for the proposition required in 
Jackson’s
 
case, still less for the
proposition, required here, that, if Woodar made a contract for a sum of money to
be paid to Transworld, Woodar can, without showing that it has itself suffered loss
or that Woodar was agent or trustee for Transworld, sue for damages for non-
payment of that sum …
Whether in a situation such as the present—viz, where it is not shown that
Woodar was agent or trustee for Transworld, or that Woodar itself sustained any
loss, Woodar can recover any damages at all, or any but nominal damages,
against Wimpey, and on what principle, is, in my opinion, a question of great doubt
and difficulty—no doubt open in this House—but one on which I prefer to reserve
my opinion.
Lord Keith of Kinkel
[referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Jackson
 
v. 
Horizon Holidays Ltd
and continued]
That case is capable of being regarded as rightly decided upon a reasonable
view of the measure of damages due to the plaintiff as the original contracting
party, and not as laying down any rule of law regarding the recovery of damages
for the benefit of third parties. There may be a certain class of cases where third
parties stand to gain indirectly by virtue of a contract, and where their deprivation
of that gain can properly be regarded as no more than a consequence of the loss
suffered by one of the contracting parties. In that situation there may be no
question of the third parties having any claim to damages in their own right, but yet
it may be proper to take into account in assessing the damages recoverable by the
contracting party an element in respect of expense incurred by him in replacing by
other means benefits of which the third parties have been deprived or in mitigating
the consequences of that deprivation. The decision in 
Jackson
 
v. 
Horizon Holidays
Ltd
 
is not, however … capable of being supported upon the basis of the true ratio
decidendi in 
Lloyd’s
 
v. 
Harper
 
16 Ch D 290, which rested entirely on the principles
of agency.
Lord Scarman
I believe it open to the House to declare that, in the absence of evidence to show
that he has suffered no loss, A, who has contracted for a payment to be made to C,
may rely on the fact that he required the payment to be made as prima facie
evidence that the promise for which he contracted was a benefit to him and that
the measure of his loss in the event of non-payment is the benefit which he
intended for C but which has not been received. Whatever the reason, he must
have desired the payment to be made to C and he must have been relying on B to
make it. If B fails to make the payment, A must find the money from other funds if
he is to confer the benefit which he sought by his contract to confer upon C.
Without expressing a final opinion on a question, which is clearly difficult, I think
the point is one which does require consideration by your Lordships’ House.
Lord Salmon
 
agreed with Lord Wilberforce, but added that, in his opinion, ‘the law
as it stands at present in relation to damages of this kind is most unsatisfactory:
and I can only hope that 
your Lordships’ House will soon have an opportunity of
reconsidering it unless in the meantime it is altered by statute’. 
Lord Russell of
Killowen
 
was critical of the reasoning of Lord Denning in 
Jackson’s
 
case and
pointed out ‘that the order of the Court of Appeal as drawn up did not suggest that
any part of the damages awarded to [Mr Jackson] were “for the use and benefit of”
any member of his family’. He was therefore of the opinion that Woodar were only
entitled to recover nominal damages in respect of the £150,000 payable to
Transworld.
Commentary
One point which does emerge with clarity from the judgments in 
Woodar
 
is their
Lordships’ disapproval of the reasoning of Lord Denning in 
Jackson
. Matters are more
difficult in relation to the scope of the right of recovery recognized by their Lordships.
The fact that their analysis was all 
obiter
, and hence rather tentative, does not help. If
Woodar had acted as agent or trustee for Transworld, it seems clear that Woodar would
have been entitled to recover substantial damages. But in the absence of agency or trust,
and assuming that Woodar had not itself suffered any loss as a result of the failure to
make the payment to Transworld, it seems that Woodar’s claim would have failed in the
absence of judicial re-consideration of the underlying general rule that a party can only
recover in respect of his own loss. But, as we have noted (see earlier in this section), the
general rule was re-affirmed by the House of Lords in 
Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd
v. 
Panatown Ltd
 
[2001] 1 AC 518. Indeed, 
Woodar
 
would appear to emerge unscathed
from 
Panatown
. Lord Clyde cited it (at p. 522) for its recognition of the agency and
trustee exception to the general rule, although (at p. 535) he also cited with approval
Lord Wilberforce’s observation that ‘there are many situations of daily life which do not
fit neatly into conceptual analysis, but which require some flexibility in the law of
contract’. Lord Jauncey summarized the judgments in 
Woodar
 
(at pp. 572–573) and,
while he noted the reservations of Lords Salmon and Scarman, did not suggest that
Woodar should have been entitled to recover. Lord Browne-Wilkinson made no mention
of the case. Of the dissentients, Lord Goff (at p. 553) was of the view that broader
recognition of the plaintiff’s performance interest would encompass some of the
examples given by Lord Wilberforce in his judgment but he did not state expressly
whether or not he would have held that Woodar was entitled to recover damages in
respect of the £150,000 payable to Transworld. Lord Millett (at p. 589) cited the passage
extracted earlier from the speech of Lord Scarman with apparent approval and his broad
conception of the plaintiff’s performance interest would appear to lead him to the
conclusion that Woodar should have been entitled to recover substantial damages in
respect of Wimpey’s failure to pay Transworld but, again, he did not say so expressly.
Why should Woodar not be entitled to recover damages in respect of the £150,000
payable to Transworld? Even assuming that there is a general rule to the effect that a
contracting party cannot recover damages in respect of a loss suffered by a third party,
should the parties not be able to contract out of it? If A and B enter into a contract and
they agree that any breach by A will have a detrimental effect on C and that B should be
entitled to sue and recover damages on behalf of C, why should the law refuse to give
effect to that agreement? This hypothetical example is not very far away from the fact
situation in 
Woodar
. Wimpey agreed to pay £150,000 to Transworld and it is unlikely
that the parties intended that Wimpey should be able to break its promise with
impunity. Is it not more likely that the parties intended that Woodar should be entitled
to sue for damages subject to its duty to account for the sum so received to Transworld?
It may be that the parties did not make their 
intention in this regard sufficiently explicit
(and they also failed to make use of agency or the trust which would have protected
Woodar’s claim in relation to the £150,000) but, assuming that such was their intention,
should the courts not have given effect to it? In other words, the law should recognize
that the parties are entitled to contract out of the rule that a party to a contract cannot
sue and recover damages in respect of a loss suffered by a third party.
As it is, the law recognizes various exceptions to the general rule that a party can only
recover damages in respect of its own loss, albeit that the exceptions do not appear to go
as far as to suggest that it is open to the parties to contract out of the general rule. The
principal exceptions which have been recognized are as follows. First, a trustee can sue
and recover damages even though the loss is suffered by the beneficiary. Secondly, an
agent can recover damages notwithstanding the fact that the loss has been suffered by
his principal. A further exception was recognized by Lord Diplock in 
The Albazero
[1977] AC 774, 847 when he stated:
[I]n a commercial contract concerning goods where it is in the contemplation of the parties that the proprietary
interests in the goods may be transferred from one owner to another after the contract has been entered into
and before the breach which causes loss or damage to the goods, an original party to the contract, if such be the
intention of them both, is to be treated in law as having entered into the contract for the benefit of all persons
who have or may acquire an interest in the goods before they are lost or damaged, and is entitled to recover by
way of damages for breach of contract the actual loss sustained by those for whose benefit the contract is
entered into.
The scope of this exception is a matter of some doubt. This principle originated in the
context of contracts for the carriage of goods but it is clear that it is no longer so
confined (
Swynson Ltd
 
v. 
Lowick Rose LLP
 
[2017] UKSC 32, [2018] AC 313, [15]). It has
been applied by the House of Lords to building contracts (see 
Linden Gardens Trust Ltd
v. 
Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd
 
[1994] 1 AC 85). It is clear that the exception cannot be
invoked where the third party is given its own right of action against the party in breach
(
Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd
 
v. 
Panatown Ltd
 
[2001] 1 AC 518). One particularly
troublesome issue is whether or not it is confined to the case where it was in the
contemplation of the parties that the ownership of the property would or might in the
ordinary course of business be transferred by the contracting party to a successor in title
during the currency of the contract. Lord Diplock clearly thought it was so confined and
his view was endorsed by Lord Millett in 
Panatown
 
(at p. 583). On the other hand, Lord
Clyde stated in 
Panatown
 
(at p. 531) that a change of ownership was not a necessary
ingredient of the exception and the Court of Appeal so decided in 
Darlington Borough
Council
 
v. 
Wiltshier Northern Ltd
 
[1995] 1 WLR 68. The most that can be said is that
the exception clearly applies in the context of a contemplated transfer of property and
leading summaries of the principle frequently make express reference to the transfer of
property when formulating the principle (see, for example, 
Swynson Ltd
 
v. 
Lowick Rose
LLP
 
[2017] UKSC 32, [2018] AC 313, [104]) but it may be that, in an exceptional case,
the principle could be extended to a case where the transfer of property is not in
contemplation. But one would expect the court to proceed cautiously before so
extending the exception.
25.3.3
 
The Exceptions to Privity
The rule that a third party cannot sue on a contract to which he is not party was never
absolute. The law always recognized some exceptions to, or qualifications of, the rule.
The source of these 
exceptions is to be found both at common law and in various
statutes. The principal exceptions, prior to the enactment of the 1999 Act, are as follows:
25.3.3.1
 
Collateral Contracts
The first is to find that the third party is not in fact a third party but is a party to a
contract with the party who has failed to carry out his promise. The device that the
courts can employ to this effect is the collateral contract. It can be seen at work in the
case of 
Shanklin Pier Ltd
 
v. 
Detel Products Ltd
 
[1951] 2 KB 854. The defendant paint
manufacturers represented to the plaintiffs, the owners of a pier, that the paint which
they manufactured was suitable for use in the re-painting of the pier and would have a
life of seven to ten years. In reliance upon the defendant’s representation the plaintiffs
instructed the contractors they had employed to re-paint the pier that they should use
the defendant’s paint. The paint proved to be unsuitable for use on the pier and its
lifespan was considerably less than the promised seven to ten years. The plaintiffs
brought an action against the defendants. The defendants denied that they had provided
any warranty but the trial judge, McNair J, held that such a warranty had been given. He
then turned to the defendants’ second line of defence which was that the warranty did
not give to the plaintiffs a cause of action. McNair J stated (at p. 856):
Counsel for the defendants submitted that in law a warranty can give rise to no enforceable cause of action
except between the same parties as the parties to the main contract in relation to which the warranty is given. In
principle, this submission seems to me to be unsound. If, as is elementary, the consideration for the warranty in
the usual case is the entering into of the main contract in relation to which the warranty is given, I see no reason
why there may not be an enforceable warranty between A and B supported by the consideration that B should
cause C to enter into a contract with A or that B should do some act for the benefit of A.
He therefore held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover damages from the
defendant.
The principal problem likely to confront any claimant who wishes to rely upon the
existence of a collateral contract is that it must adduce evidence to support the existence
of such a contract (in terms of offer, acceptance, intention to create legal relations, and
consideration). In some cases the courts have found that there was no intention to
create a collateral contract (see, for example, 
Independent Broadcasting Authority
 
v.
EMI Electronics
 
(1980) 14 Build LR 1). However examples can be found of cases in
which the courts have adopted a very flexible approach to the identification of offer,
acceptance, and consideration (see, in particular, 
New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
AM
Satterthwaite & Co Ltd (The Eurymedon)
 
[1975] AC 154, at 
25.3.4
). A court may be slow
to imply the existence of a collateral contract where the parties are experienced in
commerce and could have created a direct contractual relationship but chose not to do
so (
Fuji Seal Europe Ltd
 
v. 
Catalytic Combustion Corporation
 
[2005] EWHC 1659
(TCC), 102 Con LR 47).
The status of the collateral contract device as an exception to the doctrine of privity is
open to question on the basis that it is not in fact an exception because it rests on a
finding by the court that the third party is not a third party but is a party to a contract.
Nevertheless, it is customary to treat the collateral contract device as an exception to the
doctrine of privity on the basis that some of the cases adopt a rather strained analysis of
the relationship between the parties in order to find that the claimant and the defendant
were in fact contracting parties (see, in particular, 
The Eurymedon
).
25.3.3.2
 
Trust of a Contractual Right
In 
Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company Ltd
 
v. 
Selfridge and Company Ltd
 
[1915] AC 847
(
25.3.1
) Viscount Haldane LC stated that, while English law does not recognize a third
party right of action arising by way of contract, such a ‘right may be conferred by way of
property, as, for example, under a trust’. In other words, a promisee may agree to hold
his contractual right to sue the promisor on trust for the third party and, as a beneficiary
under a trust, the third party acquires a property right which he can assert against
someone, such as the promisor, who interferes with it. Cases can be found in which the
courts have found the existence of a trust of a contractual right (see, for example, 
Les
Affréteurs Réunis
 
v. 
Walford
 
[1919] AC 801) and, for a time, it appeared that the trust
might prove to be a suitable vehicle for out-flanking privity and conferring enforceable
rights of action on third parties. But it was not to be. By the time we get to 
Beswick
 
v.
Beswick
 
in 1967 (
25.3.2.1
) we find that it was ‘common ground’ between the parties that
Peter Beswick did not enter into the agreement with his nephew as trustee for his wife in
relation to the annuity to be paid to her.
With the benefit of hindsight we can see that the turning point was the decision of the
Court of Appeal in 
Re Schebsman
 
[1944] Ch 83. John Schebsman (referred to as ‘the
debtor’) worked for a Swiss company and its subsidiary, an English company, until his
contract was terminated in 1940. On 20 September 1940 Schebsman entered into an
agreement with the two companies under which, in consideration of the termination of
his employment, the companies agreed to pay him £5,500 in six instalments. The
agreement provided that, in the event that Schebsman died before all six payments had
been made to him, the money was to be paid to his wife and, if she died, his daughter.
Schebsman was adjudicated bankrupt on 5 March 1942 and died on 12 May 1942. His
trustee in bankruptcy sought a declaration that the sums payable to Schebsman’s widow
and, possibly, his daughter formed part of Schebsman’s estate with the result that they
should be gathered in by the trustee in bankruptcy and distributed among Schebsman’s
creditors rather than paid to his widow or daughter. The basis on which the trustee in
bankruptcy sought this declaration was the submission that Schebsman had a right to
intercept the money payable to his widow and that that right now resided in the trustee
in bankruptcy. The Court of Appeal held that Schebsman had no such right of
interception and that the trustee in bankruptcy was not entitled to the declaration
sought. Our interest in the case lies in the submission advanced by counsel for the
defendant, Mr Denning KC, that the contract between the companies and Schebsman
created a trust in favour of Schebsman’s widow and daughter. Uthwatt J and the Court
of Appeal held that no such trust had been created. In the Court of Appeal Lord Greene
MR stated (at p. 89) that:
[t]he first question which arises is whether or not the debtor was a trustee for his wife and daughter of the
benefit of the undertaking given by the English company in their favour. An examination of the decided cases
does, it is true, show that the courts have on occasions adopted what may be called a liberal view on questions of
this character, but in the present case I cannot find in the contract anything to justify the conclusion that a trust
was intended. It is not legitimate to import into the contract the idea of a trust when the parties have given no
indication that such was their intention. To interpret this contract as creating a trust would, in my judgment, be
to disregard the dividing line between the case of a trust and the simple case of a contract made between two
persons for the benefit of a third. That dividing line exists, although it may not always be easy to determine
where it is to be drawn. In the present case I find no difficulty.
To similar effect is the judgment of du Parcq LJ. He stated (at p. 104):
It was argued by Mr Denning that one effect of the agreement of September 20, 1940, was that a trust was
thereby created, and that the debtor constituted himself trustee for Mrs Schebsman of the benefit of the
covenant under which payments were to be made to her. Uthwatt J rejected this contention, and the argument
has not satisfied me that he was wrong. It is true that, by the use possibly of unguarded language, a person may
create a trust, as Monsieur Jourdain talked prose, without knowing it, but unless an intention to create a trust is
clearly to be collected from the language used and the circumstances of the case, I think that the court ought not
to be astute to discover indications of such an intention. I have little doubt that in the present case both parties
(and certainly the debtor) intended to keep alive their common law right to vary consensually the terms of the
obligation undertaken by the company, and if circumstances had changed in the debtor’s life-time injustice
might have been done by holding that a trust had been created and that those terms were accordingly
unalterable. On this point, therefore, I agree with Uthwatt J.
The demise of the trust in this context can be attributed to two related factors. The first
is that the courts now take seriously the requirement that the parties must have had an
intention to create a trust. At first instance in 
Re Schebsman
 
[1943] Ch 366, 368 Mr
Denning KC referred Uthwatt J to a famous article by Professor Corbin (‘Contracts for
the Benefit of Third Parties’ (1930) 46 
LQR
 
12) in support of his submission that a trust
had been created on the facts of the case. Uthwatt J referred to the article by Corbin,
considered the cases referred to in the article, and continued (at p. 370):
I am unable to see that they justify the conclusion at which he arrived that in some cases of the class now under
consideration a fiction has been resorted to in order to raise a trust. The cases, no doubt, are hard to reconcile,
but, to my mind, the explanation of them is that different minds may reach differing conclusions on the
question whether the circumstances sufficiently show an intention to create a trust. Inferences as to intent may
vary. … In the present case there can be no question of any estoppel, and there is nothing, except the terms of
the contract itself, on which to ground an inference that there was an intention to create a trust and that the
intent was duly put into effect … I do not think any such inference can properly be drawn. The only inference I
draw is the obvious one, that the parties thought the contract would be carried out.
In most cases (
Schebsman
 
being an example) the intention of the parties is simply to
enter into a contract and they will have given no thought to the creation of a trust. This
being the case, there will be no intention to create a trust and so no trust. The second,
and related factor is that a trust, once recognized, is irrevocable. This protects the
position of the third party, in that he acquires an irrevocable right, but it deprives the
parties to the contract of the freedom to change their minds. As du Parcq LJ noted in
Schebsman
, the contracting parties are likely to be slow to give up their freedom in this
respect and, this being the case, the courts can be expected to be slow to infer the
existence of a trust.
It would, however, be a mistake to dismiss the trust as a modern day irrelevance in this
context. Parties who wish to create a trust of a contractual right are free to do so and it is
not a difficult task for a lawyer to draw up a document that makes clear the parties’
intention to create a trust. The principal drawback is that the trust, once constituted, is
irrevocable. This 
being the case, it is necessary to think carefully before setting up a
trust. But contracting parties who are certain that they want to confer an irrevocable
right of action upon the third party can make use of the trust device in order to give
effect to their intention.
25.3.3.3
 
Assignment
The doctrine of privity prevents A and B from conferring upon C, a third party, a right to
enforce a term of their contract. But the law does allow a contracting party to transfer, or
assign, his rights under a contract to a third party. This process, known as assignment, is
an important feature of commercial practice. Assignment is particularly common in
relation to debts (although it is not confined to debts). Suppose that A owes a sum of
money to B and that the debt is repayable over a three-year period. B decides that he
does not want to wait for three years for repayment in full and so he sells to C his rights
against A in return for a cash payment from C. B, the creditor, will sell his rights against
A by assigning them to C. The amount paid by C will generally be a percentage of the
debt. In this way B gets access to instant cash and C makes his profit by paying to B a
percentage (say 85 per cent) of the debt owed by A and by recovering the debt from A
over the three-year period. The law relating to assignment is complex but it suffices for
our purposes to note five points.
The first is that a distinction must be drawn between the assignment of contractual
rights and the assignment of liabilities. As a general rule liabilities cannot be assigned
without the consent of the party to whom the liability is owed. Contractual rights are
more freely assignable and the extent to which they can be assigned is discussed in
points two, three, and four.
The second point relates to the legal basis of an assignment. Assignments are either
equitable or statutory in nature (the common law having largely set its face against the
assignment of contractual rights). A statutory assignment generally takes effect under
section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 provided that the requirements of the
section have been satisfied. There are a number of requirements: (i) the assignment
must be absolute and not by way of charge; (ii) the assignment must be unconditional so
that it cannot, for example, take effect upon the occurrence of a future, uncertain event;
(iii) the assignment must be in writing and signed by the assignor; (iv) express notice in
writing must be given to the debtor; and (v) the assignment must be of ‘any debt or
other legal thing in action’. A statutory assignee is entitled to sue the debtor without
having to join the assignor as a party to the action. Equity generally takes a more flexible
approach to the validity of assignments so that an assignment that fails to comply with
the requirements of section 136 may nevertheless take effect as an equitable assignment.
Thus an equitable assignment may be valid notwithstanding the fact that it is not in
writing (unless statute, such as section 53(1)(c) of the Law of Property Act 1925,
provides otherwise) and notice has not been given to the debtor (although good practice
usually dictates that notice is given to the debtor). An equitable assignee must generally
join the assignor as a party to the action. In the case of a statutory assignment the
assignee need not have provided consideration, although, in the case of an equitable
assignment, the point is more doubtful (the safest course being to ensure that
consideration is provided).
The third point relates to the extent to which contractual rights are assignable. Not all
contractual rights are assignable. In the first place the contract may prohibit assignment
or place limits on the extent to which rights under the contract can be assigned. A
purported assignment which breaches a prohibition upon assignment will not be
effective to confer rights upon the assignee, at least as between the assignee and the
debtor (see 
Linden Gardens Trust Ltd
 
v. 
Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd
 
[1994] 1 AC 85).
Secondly, a mere right to sue for 
damages (or, as it is sometimes put, a bare right to
litigate) is not assignable unless the assignee has a genuine commercial or financial
interest in taking the assignment (
Trendtex Trading Corporation
 
v. 
Credit Suisse
[1982] AC 679) and, for this purpose, the assignment of a cause of action to enable the
assignee or a third party to make a profit out of the litigation will generally be void as
savouring of champerty (
Simpson
 
v. 
Norfolk NHS Trust
 
[2011] EWCA Civ 1149, [2012] 1
All ER 1423). Thirdly, where the relationship between the parties to the original contract
is a personal one, the law may not give effect to an assignment of the rights under that
contract (so, for example, the benefit of a car insurance policy is not assignable nor is
any contractual right involving personal skill on the part of the creditor). In 
Tolhurst
 
v.
Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd
 
[1902] 2 KB 660, 668 Collins MR
summed up the position when he stated that the benefit of a contract is only assignable
in cases ‘where it can make no objective difference to the person on whom the obligation
lies to which of two persons he is to discharge it’.
The fourth point is that an assignment takes effect ‘subject to equities’, that is to say the
assignee acquires the contractual rights of the assignor subject to all the defences that
would have prevailed against the assignor. A related rule is that an assignee cannot
generally recover more by way of damages than the assignor would have recovered had
there been no assignment (see 
Dawson
 
v. 
Great Northern & City Railway Co
 
[1905] 1
KB 260). This rule is ‘not designed to allow a defendant to escape liability for breach’ but
rather to ‘ensure that he does not have to meet a bigger liability than he would have been
under to the assignor’ (
Offer-Hoar
 
v. 
Larkstore Ltd (Technotrade Ltd
, Part 20
defendant)
 
[2006] EWCA Civ 1079, [2006] 1 WLR 2926, [42] and [87]). The liability to
the assignor can, however, be substantial, particularly given the fact that the assignor’s
claim for damages is not, in principle, limited to the loss suffered as at the date of the
accrual of the cause of action (
Offer-Hoar
).
The final point is that the burden of a contract cannot be assigned without the consent of
the other party to the contract. The requirement that consent be obtained to the transfer
of liabilities is necessary to protect the right of contracting parties to choose their
contracting parties. Were the law otherwise a party could enter into a contract with one
party, only to find that performance is provided by another party and that he has no
right to object and no means of redress. It is, however, important to note that the law
does allow liabilities to be transferred provided that consent is obtained. This process is
known as novation. The law relating to novation was summarized by David Steel J in
The Tychy (No 2)
 
[2001] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 10, 24 in the following terms:
(a) Novation involves the creation of a new contract where an existing party is replaced by a new party. (b)
Thus, novation requires the consent of all parties, including in particular the party which is thereby accepting a
new person as his debtor or as his counterpart under an executory contract. (c) The consent may be apparent
from express words or inferred from conduct. (d) The consent must be clearly established on the evidence as
being only consistent with the intent of achieving a novation.
Novation provides a means by which one contracting party can drop out of the contract
and be replaced by another party who will acquire the rights and obligations of the party
who drops out of the contract. So, for example, novation provides the means by which a
third party can be substituted as a lender under a loan agreement. Novation thus
assumes an important role in commercial practice in that it enables the parties to
restructure transactions and it also facilitates the transfer of financial assets.
25.3.3.4
 
Agency
The relationship between the law of agency and the doctrine of privity is an uneasy one.
Parts of the law of agency can be explained in terms which are consistent with privity,
but other parts, particularly the rules relating to undisclosed principals, are very difficult
to reconcile with privity. As we have noted (
25.3.1
), Viscount Haldane in 
Dunlop
Pneumatic Tyre Company Ltd
 
v. 
Selfridge and Company Ltd
 
[1915] AC 847 stated that
a principal not named in a contract may sue upon it if the promisee really contracted as
his agent provided that the principal has given consideration either personally or
through the promisee acting as his agent.
An agent is a person who has authority from another party, his principal, to act on the
principal’s behalf in such a way as to affect the principal’s legal relations with third
parties. Suppose that company X appoints a number of independent brokers to act on its
behalf in selling the company’s products. Company X limits the authority of its brokers
in various ways (for example, no broker can offer a customer a discount greater than 10
per cent without first obtaining approval from head office). One of the brokers, after
disclosing that he is acting as an agent for X, concludes a contract with a third party
under which the third party agrees to buy products from company X. Who are the
parties to the contract for the purchase of these products? The answer is that it is
company X and the third party. The general rule is that once an agent, acting within the
scope of his authority, has concluded a contract with a third party, the agent ‘drops out
of the picture’ so that he can neither sue nor be sued upon the contract (
Wakefield
 
v.
Duckworth
 
[1915] 1 KB 218). More difficult is the case where the agent acts in excess of
his authority in concluding the contract. Suppose that the broker offers the third party a
discount of 15 per cent without first obtaining approval from head office. Is X bound by
this contract? The answer depends on whether or not the agent was acting within the
scope of his authority in entering into the contract on these terms. Obviously the broker
did not have actual authority to conclude the contract but the prohibition or limitation
placed on his authority by X does not necessarily bind the third party. In order to
protect the position of third parties the law adopts a more extensive conception of
authority that extends beyond actual authority to implied authority, apparent authority,
and usual authority. It is not necessary to analyse these concepts in any detail here. It
suffices to state that, where the principal holds out the agent as having certain authority
or a party in the position of the agent would customarily have a certain amount of
authority, the third party is not generally bound by any narrower limit on the authority
of the agent unless the third party has notice of such a limitation. This branch of the law
of agency can generally be explained in terms that are consistent with the doctrine of
privity. In these cases the principal is not a third party intervening on a contract which
he did not make. The agent disclosed to the third party that he was acting on behalf of
the principal and the agent’s function was to bring about a contractual relationship
between the principal and the third party. In these circumstances the proposition that
the principal is a party to, or privy to, the contract is an acceptable one.
Much more difficult to explain is the doctrine of the undisclosed principal. The law
relating to the undisclosed principal was summarized by Lord Lloyd in 
Siu Yin Kwan
 
v.
Eastern Insurance Co Ltd
 
[1994] 2 AC 199, 207 in the following terms:
(1) An undisclosed principal may sue and be sued on a contract made by an agent on his behalf, acting within
the scope of his actual authority. (2) In entering into the contract, the agent must intend to act on the principal’s
behalf. (3) The agent of an undisclosed principal may 
also sue and be sued on the contract. (4) Any defence
which the third party may have against the agent is available against his principal. (5) The terms of the contract
may, expressly or by implication, exclude the principal’s right to sue, and his liability to be sued. The contract
itself, or the circumstances surrounding the contract, may show that the agent is the true and only principal.
In this instance the third party is unaware of the existence of the principal but the
principal is nevertheless entitled to sue, and can be sued, on the contract. As has been
pointed out (
Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency
 
(22nd edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021),
para 8–069), ‘it is difficult to deny that the undisclosed principal is really a third party
intervening on a contract which the principal did not make’. This point was conceded by
Lord Lloyd in 
Siu Yin Kwan
 
when he stated that ‘it seems to be generally accepted that,
while the development of this branch of the law may have been anomalous, since it runs
counter to fundamental principles of privity of contract, it is justified on grounds of
commercial convenience’. The ‘commercial convenience’ of the doctrine has been
disputed on the ground that it can cause hardship to a third party who finds himself
bound by a contract with a party of whose existence he was unaware and to whose
presence he may object (although it should be noted that, where the benefit of the
contract is assignable, the third party does not have the right to choose his contracting
party). True, the law has imposed limits on the entitlement of the principal to intervene
on the contract (see, for example, 
Said
 
v. 
Butt
 
[1920] 3 KB 497) but these limits are of
uncertain scope and may leave the third party bound by a contract with a principal with
whom the third party would never knowingly have contracted (
Dyster
 
v. 
Randall & Sons
[1926] Ch 932). Some of the cases in this area of the law are extremely difficult, if not
impossible to reconcile with the doctrine of privity (see, for example, 
Watteau
 
v.
Fenwick
 
[1893] 1 QB 346). It seems odd that a principal can intervene on a contract
when he is not named and one of the parties objects to his participation in the contract
while the doctrine of privity prevents a third party from intervening on a contract when
the two parties to the contract have expressly stated that the third party is to have the
right to intervene and enforce the contract (as was the case in 
Tweddle
 
v. 
Atkinson
,
25.3.1
). Given its anomalous status, it is unlikely that the undisclosed principal doctrine
will be extended in any way (
VTB Capital plc
 
v. 
Nutritek International Corp
 
[2013]
UKSC 5, [2013] 2 AC 337, [141]).
25.3.3.5
 
Negotiable Instruments
A negotiable instrument has been defined (
Goode and McKendrick on Commercial Law
(6th edn, Penguin, 2020), para 19.04) as an instrument ‘which, by statute or mercantile
usage, may be transferred by delivery and indorsement to a bona fide purchaser for
value in such circumstances that he takes free from defects in the title of prior parties’. It
is important to note that this ‘bona fide purchaser’, known as a holder in due course,
takes ‘free from defects’ and so is in a better position than an assignee because an
assignment takes effect ‘subject to equities’. A cheque is a negotiable instrument. A
person who writes a cheque is known as ‘the drawer’. The cheque is essentially an
instruction by the drawer to his bank, the drawee, to pay a third party a given sum of
money. The third party recipient of the cheque can then present the cheque and demand
payment from the drawer’s bank. Cheques, together with other negotiable instruments
(such as bills of exchange and promissory notes) have for many years played an
important role in the economy and their commercial success has depended, 
in large
part, upon the third party being given a secure right to demand payment from the bank.
While the significance of cheques will diminish in the future, with the development of
new electronic methods of payment, it is important not to lose sight of the benefits that
can be obtained by the use of a negotiable instrument.
25.3.3.6
 
Tort
A claimant who suffers loss as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the
performance of a contract with another party may have a claim against the defendant in
the tort of negligence. This proposition does not excite much controversy where the loss
which the claimant suffers is physical injury or property damage. In the great case of
Donoghue
 
v. 
Stevenson
 
[1932] AC 562 the pursuer (the term used to describe the
claimant in Scotland) alleged that she became ill after drinking ginger beer out of a
bottle which contained the remains of a decomposed snail. The ginger beer was
purchased at a café by the pursuer’s friend and so she did not have a claim in contract
against the café proprietor. So she brought an action in delict (tort) against the
manufacturer of the ginger beer. The manufacturer defended the claim and submitted
that the duty which it owed was to its contracting party and that it could not owe a duty
to a third party with whom it was not in a contractual relationship. The House of Lords
rejected the defender’s submission and held that it could be liable to the pursuer
(provided that she could establish the factual basis of her claim). Lord Atkin stated that:
[a] manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the
ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate
examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the
products will result in an injury to the consumer’s life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that
reasonable care.
More difficult is the case where the claimant suffers economic loss as a result of the
negligence of the defendant in the performance of his contract with a third party. Cases
can be found in which the courts have imposed a duty of care in favour of the claimant
in this situation, although the cases themselves have proved to be extremely
controversial. The most controversial is the decision of the House of Lords in 
Junior
Books Ltd
 
v. 
Veitchi Co Ltd
 
[1983] 1 AC 520 (see 
25.2
). The pursuers entered into a
contract with main contractors for the construction of a factory and the defenders were
employed as sub-contractors by the main contractors (although they were nominated by
the pursuers). The pursuers alleged that the floor had been laid defectively and they
brought an action in delict (tort) against the defenders. Their claim succeeded in the
House of Lords. Normally such claims would be brought in contract: the pursuer would
sue the main contractor and the main contractor would then sue the sub-contractor and
so liability would flow down the chain of contracts. But the effect of 
Junior Books
 
was to
enable the pursuers to jump down the chain of contracts and bring an action directly
against the sub-contractors. The case is open to criticism in so far as it rests on a finding
that the defenders had assumed a responsibility towards the pursuers. Indeed, in
Linklaters Business Services
 
v. 
Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd
 
[2010] EWHC 1145 (TCC),
[2010] BLR 537 Akenhead J went so far as to state (at [27]) that it was now ‘in practice
inconceivable’ that a duty of care would be found to exist on the facts of 
Junior Books
.
The normal construction (and the one adopted in cases such as 
Simaan General
Contracting Co
 
v. 
Pilkington Glass Ltd (No 2)
 
[1988] QB 758) is that the responsibility
assumed by the party in the position of 
the defender is a contractual one owed to its
immediate contracting party and not in tort to a remoter party down the chain of
contracts.
The second case is 
White
 
v. 
Jones
 
[1995] 2 AC 207, a case which the Law Commission in
their Report on 
Privity of Contract
 
(at para 2.14) state is best analysed as ‘allowing a
third party to enforce a contract by pursuing an action in tort’. The defendant solicitor
was instructed by a testator to draw up a new will. The defendant failed to do so before
the testator’s death. The intended beneficiaries under the new will brought an action in
negligence against the defendant on the basis that his negligent failure to draw up the
will had caused them to lose their bequests. By a majority of 3–2 the House of Lords
held that the claimants were entitled to bring an action in negligence against the
defendants. One factor which weighed heavily with their Lordships was that the
beneficiaries were the parties who had suffered the loss and, if they did not have a claim
against the solicitor, there would be a lacuna in the law because, although the estate (as
the contracting party) had a claim against the solicitor, it had suffered no loss and so
had no effective claim. The remedy which their Lordships fashioned in order to avoid
such a lacuna was tortious in form but has the features of a contractual claim in that, as
Lord Goff acknowledged, the solicitor is entitled to rely on any term of the contract with
his client in order to limit or exclude his liability to the beneficiaries in tort. It is
therefore a claim in tort that is subject to the terms of the contract between the solicitor
and his client.
While a claim in tort thus has the potential to outflank the doctrine of privity in this way
it is subject to the obvious limitation that the claimant, in order to succeed, must prove
that the defendant was negligent.
25.3.3.7
 
Statutory Exceptions
Prior to the enactment of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 there were a
number of statutory exceptions to the doctrine of privity. We have already seen, in
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswick
 
(
25.3.2.1
) the use that was made by Lord Denning of section 56(1) of
the Law of Property Act 1925 in an attempt to outflank the doctrine of privity of
contract. The attempt failed because the House of Lords could not discern any intention
in section 56 to effect such a radical change to common law doctrine (see 
25.3.2.1
). But
in other contexts Parliament has intervened with the express purpose of recognizing
third party rights. The significance of these legislative interventions should not be
underestimated. The contracts regulated are important commercial transactions where
tri-partite relationships are common (particularly insurance and shipping contracts).
Thus section 11 of the Married Women’s Property Act 1882 provides:
A policy of assurance effected by any man on his own life and expressed to be for the benefit of his wife, or of his
children, or of his wife and children, or any of them, or by any woman on her own life, and expressed to be for
the benefit of her husband, or of her children, or of her husband and children, or any of them, shall create a
trust in favour of the objects therein named, and the moneys payable under any such policy shall not, so long as
any object of the trust remains unperformed, form part of the estate of the insured, or be subject to his or her
debts.
And section 14(2) of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 provides:
A mortgagee, consignee, or other person having an interest in the subject matter insured may insure on behalf
and for the benefit of other persons interested as well as for his own benefit.
Section 148(7) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 provides:
Notwithstanding anything in any enactment, a person issuing a policy of insurance under section 145 of this Act
shall be liable to indemnify the persons or classes of persons specified in the policy in respect of any liability
which the policy purports to cover in the case of those persons or classes of persons.
Finally, section 2 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 provides that a person who
becomes the lawful holder of a bill of lading shall, by virtue of becoming the holder of
the bill, have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit under the contract of
carriage as if he had been a party to that contract from the outset.
25.3.4
 
Third Parties, Exclusion Clauses, and
Exclusive Jurisdiction Clauses
An issue which has given rise to great difficulty in the case-law is the question whether,
and if so to what extent, a third party may take the benefit of an exclusion or limitation
clause in a contract to which it is not a party. A related issue is whether or not a claimant
can be bound by an exclusion or limitation clause in a contract to which the defendant is
a party but the claimant is not. As we shall see, this issue is not confined to exclusion or
limitation clauses: it can arise in the context of other clauses, notably exclusive
jurisdiction clauses. The cases are both long and complex. Yet their practical significance
has diminished as a result of the enactment of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties)
Act 1999 which provides a much simpler mechanism by which contracting parties can
extend the sphere of application of these clauses. Nevertheless, the Act will not catch all
cases and, in such cases, the courts will have to fall back on the common law rules as set
out in these cases.
The approach that will be adopted in this section is to use one case, 
The Mahkutai
[1996] AC 650, as the vehicle for discussion of these issues. At the outset it must be
acknowledged that there is one drawback in this approach which is that the case
involves an exclusive jurisdiction clause (that is, a clause which requires that legal
proceedings be brought in a particular jurisdiction) rather than an exclusion clause, and
exclusive jurisdiction clauses raise one or two additional complexities in comparison
with exclusion clauses. But this disadvantage is more than outweighed by the clarity and
the elegance of Lord Goff’s analysis of the leading cases (such as 
Elder Dempster & Co
 
v.
Paterson Zochonis & Co
 
[1924] AC 522, 
Scruttons Ltd
 
v. 
Midland Silicones Ltd
 
[1962]
AC 446, 
New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
A M Satterthwaite & Co Ltd (The
Eurymedon)
 
[1975] AC 154, 
Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Ltd
 
v. 
Salmond & Spraggon
(Australia) Pty Ltd (The New York Star)
 
[1981] 1 WLR 138, and 
The Pioneer Container
[1994] 2 AC 324). Before turning to Lord Goff’s judgment three preliminary comments
must be made.
The first relates to the technicality of the language that is used in the judgments. Three
phrases merit further discussion at this point: (i) bill of lading, (ii) bailment on terms,
and (iii) vicarious immunity. A bill of lading and its functions have been described in M
Bridge (ed), 
Benjamin’s Sale of Goods
 
(11th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021), para 18–019
in the following terms:
A bill of lading is traditionally a document issued by a sea carrier and which has three functions, not all of which
are fulfilled by other documents. First, it is a receipt: i.e. it is an acknowledgment by the person issuing it that
he has received goods into his possession and 
generally that he will continue to do so and to deliver them in
accordance with his bailor’s instructions (either back to the bailor or to an authorised third party consignee).
Secondly, it is generally evidence of the terms of a contract between the shipper (and/or subsequent holder) and
the carrier. Thirdly, it is a ‘document of title’, which broadly means that the carrier, who has possession of the
goods, will deliver them to the person lawfully holding the bill and that the holder may transfer the right to
receive possession to another. However, by itself a document does not reveal the origin or the content of legal
rights and obligations relating to the goods; they do not arise merely from possession of, or with reference to,
the document.
Bailment on terms is a little more difficult to describe and indeed the precise meaning of
this phrase is the subject of some debate. Bailment is the term used to describe the
situation where one person (the bailee) is voluntarily in possession of goods that belong
to another (the bailor). Bailment on terms arises where the bailor entrusts goods to the
bailee and, either expressly or impliedly, authorizes the bailee to entrust the goods to a
third party. In such a case the bailor will be bound by the terms of the sub-bailment to
which he has consented or has authorized. Vicarious immunity, on the other hand,
means that an employee or agent who performs a contract is entitled to rely on any
immunity from liability which the contract confers on his employer or principal.
The second point is that it is vital to distinguish the case in which the clause at issue
between the parties is to be found in the main contract from the case in which the clause
at issue is to be found in the sub-contract. These two situations raise different issues,
although it is possible to have a case in which there are two relevant clauses in issue
between the parties, one in the main contract and one in the sub-contract but the
claimant and the defendant are not in a direct contractual relationship (
Scruttons Ltd
 
v.
Midland Silicones Ltd
 
[1962] AC 446 being such a case).
The third point relates to the policy issues at stake. The policy issues in the exclusion
clause cases differ from those that arise in the context of exclusive jurisdiction clauses.
The policy issues in relation to exclusive jurisdiction clauses are raised in Lord Goff’s
judgment in 
The Mahkutai
 
and so here it suffices to mention the conflicting policy
issues that arise in the exclusion clause cases. On the one hand, the courts have, as we
have seen (
Chapter 13
), generally adopted a restrictive approach towards exclusion
clauses. This suggests that they are likely to apply privity strictly and refuse to extend
the benefit of an exclusion clause to a third party. On the other hand, in some of the
cases it seems clear that the intention of all the parties was that the benefit of the
exclusion clause should be enjoyed by the third party (such as an employee) and, in such
cases, the judges are generally unwilling to frustrate the intention of the parties,
particularly in commercial transactions which have been negotiated at arm’s length.
This conflict of policies has been reflected in the different approaches taken by the
judiciary over the years, a point noted by Lord Goff in 
The Mahkutai.
THE MAHKUTAI
[1996] AC 650, Privy Council
Indonesian shipowners chartered their vessel to an Indonesian corporation (‘the
carrier’) who in turn sub-chartered it to Indonesian timber merchants (‘the
shippers’) for the carriage of a cargo of plywood from Jakarta to Shantou in the
People’s Republic of China. The master of the vessel authorized the carrier’s agent
to sign a bill of lading which provided, in condition 
4, that, every servant, agent, or
subcontractor of the carrier was to have the benefit of all ‘exceptions, limitations,
provision, conditions and liberties herein benefiting the carrier as if such provisions
were expressly made for their benefit’. Condition 19 of the bill of lading further
provided that:
the contract evidenced by the bill of lading shall be governed by the law of Indonesia and any dispute
arising hereunder shall be determined by the Indonesian courts according to that law to the exclusion of
the jurisdiction of the courts of any other country.
When the vessel arrived in Shantou it was discovered that the plywood in one of
the holds had been damaged by sea water. The vessel then proceeded to Hong
Kong for the purpose of discharging other cargo. On arrival of the vessel in Hong
Kong the cargo owners issued a writ against the shipowners claiming damages for
breach of contract, breach of duty, or negligence. The shipowners sought to stay
the proceedings in Hong Kong on the ground that the proceedings had been
brought in breach of condition 19, the exclusive jurisdiction clause. Sears J held
that the shipowners were entitled to invoke the exclusive jurisdiction clause and he
ordered that the proceedings in Hong Kong be stayed. The cargo owners appealed
to the Court of Appeal who allowed the appeal. The shipowners then appealed to
the Privy Council. They submitted that they were entitled to rely on the exclusive
jurisdiction clause on the basis of two principles: (i) that established by the Privy
Council in 
New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
A M Satterthwaite & Co Ltd (The
Eurymedon)
 
[1975] AC 154 and 
Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Ltd
 
v. 
Salmond &
Spraggon (Australia) Pty Ltd (The New York Star)
 
[1981] 1 WLR 138 and (ii), in the
alternative, on the basis of the principle of bailment on terms, the origins of which
are to be found in the speech of Lord Sumner in 
Elder Dempster & Co
 
v. 
Paterson
Zochonis & Co
 
[1924] AC 522. The Privy Council held that the shipowners were
not entitled to invoke the exclusive jurisdiction clause against the cargo owners,
that the cargo owners were entitled to bring the action in Hong Kong against the
shipowners, and that the stay had been properly set aside.
Lord Goff of Chieveley
[giving the judgment of the Privy Council set out the facts and continued]
The pendulum of judicial opinion
The two principles which the shipowners invoke are the product of developments
in English law during the present century. During that period, opinion has fluctuated
about the desirability of recognising some form of modification of, or exception to,
the strict doctrine of privity of contract to accommodate situations which arise in
the context of carriage of goods by sea, in which it appears to be in accordance
with commercial expectations that the benefit of certain terms of the contract of
carriage should be made available to parties involved in the adventure who are not
parties to the contract. These cases have been concerned primarily with
stevedores claiming the benefit of exceptions and limitations in bills of lading, but
also with shipowners claiming the protection of such terms contained in charterers’
bills. At first there appears to have been a readiness on the part of judges to
recognise such claims, especially in 
Elder Dempster & Co
 
v. 
Paterson, Zochonis &
Co Ltd
, [1924] AC 522, concerned with the principle of bailment on terms. Opinion
however hardened against them in the middle of the century as the pendulum
swung back in the direction of orthodoxy in 
Midland Silicones Ltd
 
v. 
Scruttons Ltd
[1962] AC 446; but in more recent years it has swung back again to recognition of
their commercial desirability, notably in the 
two leading cases concerned with
claims by stevedores to the protection of a Himalaya clause—
New Zealand
Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
A M Satterthwaite & Co Ltd (The Eurymedon)
 
[1975] AC 154
and 
Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Ltd
 
v. 
Salmond & Spraggon (Australia) Pty Ltd
(The New York Star)
 
[1981] 1 WLR 138.
In the present case shipowners carrying cargo shipped under charterers’ bills of
lading are seeking to claim the benefit of a Himalaya clause in the time charterers’
bills of lading, or in the alternative to invoke the principle of bailment on terms.
However they are seeking by these means to invoke not an exception or limitation
in the ordinary sense of those words, but the benefit of an exclusive jurisdiction
clause. This would involve a significantly wider application of the relevant
principles; and, to judge whether this extension is justified, their Lordships consider
it desirable first to trace the development of the principles through the cases.
The Elder Dempster
 
case [1924] AC 522
The principle of bailment on terms finds its origin in the 
Elder Dempster
 
case. That
case was concerned with a damage to cargo claim in respect of a number of casks
of palm oil which had been crushed by heavy bags of palm kernels stowed above
them in a ship with deep holds but no ‘tween decks to take the weight of the cargo
stowed above. The main question in the case was whether such damage was to
be classified as damage arising from unseaworthiness of the ship due to absence
of ‘tween decks, or as damage arising from bad stowage; in the latter event, no
claim lay under the bills of lading, which contained an exception excluding claims
for bad stowage. The bills of lading were time charterers’ bills, the vessel having
been chartered in by the time charterers as an additional vessel for their West
African line. The House of Lords (on this point differing from a majority of the Court
of Appeal) held that the damage was to be attributed to bad stowage, and as a
result the time charterers were protected by the bill of lading exception; but the
cargo owners had also sued the shipowners in tort, and the question arose
whether the shipowners too were protected by the exception contained in the bill of
lading, to which they were not parties. In the Court of Appeal [1923] 1 KB 420,
441–442, Scrutton LJ (who alone considered that the damage was to be attributed
to bad stowage rather than unseaworthiness) rejected the claim against the
shipowners on a suggested principle of vicarious immunity. This principle was
relied on by the shipowners in argument before the House of Lords [1924] AC 522
and was accepted, at p. 534, by Viscount Cave (with whom Lord Carson, at p. 565,
agreed), and apparently also by Viscount Finlay, at p. 548. But the preferred
reason given by Lord Sumner, at p. 564 (with whom Lord Dunedin, at p. 548, and
Lord Carson, at p. 565, agreed) was that:
‘in the circumstances of this case the obligations to be inferred from the reception of the cargo for
carriage to the United Kingdom amount to a bailment upon terms, which include the exceptions and
limitations of liability stipulated in the known and contemplated form of bill of lading.’
The 
Midland Silicones
 
case [1962] AC 446
This was a test case in which it was sought to establish a basis upon which
stevedores could claim the protection of exceptions and limitations contained in the
bill of lading contract. Here the stevedores had negligently damaged a drum of
chemicals after discharge at London, to which the goods had been shipped from
New York under a bill of lading incorporating the United States Carriage of Goods
by Sea Act 1936, which contained the Hague Rules limitation of liability to £500 per
package or unit. The stevedores sought to claim the benefit of this limit as against
the receivers. They claimed to rely on the principle of bailment 
on terms derived
from the 
Elder Dempster
 
case [1924] AC 522. But they also sought a contractual
basis for their contention on various grounds—that they had contracted with the
receivers through the agency of the shipowners; that they could rely on an implied
contract independent of the bill of lading; or that they could as an interested third
party take the benefit of the limit in the bill of lading contract. All these arguments
failed. The principle of bailment on terms was given a restrictive treatment; and the
various contractual arguments foundered on the doctrine of privity of contract,
Viscount Simonds in particular reasserting that doctrine in its orthodox form: [1962]
AC 446, 467–468. For present purposes, however, three features can be selected
as important.
First, the case revealed, at least on the part of Viscount Simonds … a
remarkable shift from the philosophy which informed the decision in the 
Elder
Dempster
 
case [1924] AC 522. There the point in question was treated very briefly
by the members of the Appellate Committee, apparently because it seemed
obvious to them that the cargo owners’ alternative claim against the shipowners
should fail. It was perceived, expressly by Viscount Finlay, at p. 548, and, it seems,
implicitly by the remainder, that:
‘[i]t would be absurd that the owner of the goods could get rid of the protective clauses of the bill of
lading, in respect of all stowage, by suing the owner of the ship in tort.’
By contrast Fullagar J, in the 
Darling Island
 
case, 95 CLR 43, 71, condemned ‘a
curious, and seemingly irresistible, anxiety to save grossly negligent people from
the normal consequences of their negligence’, a sentiment to be echoed by
Viscount Simonds in the concluding sentence of his speech in the 
Midland
Silicones
 
case [1962] AC 446, 472.
Second, the 
Elder Dempster
 
case [1924] AC 522 was kept within strict bounds.
Viscount Simonds [1962] AC 446, 470 quoted with approval the interpretation
adopted by Fullagar J (with whom Dixon CJ agreed) in the High Court of Australia
in the 
Darling Island
 
case, 95 CLR 43, 78 where he said:
‘In my opinion, what the 
Elder Dempster
 
case decided, and all that it decided, is that in such a case, the
master having signed the bill of lading, the proper inference is that the shipowner, when he receives the
goods into his possession, receives them on the terms of the bill of lading. The same inference might
perhaps be drawn in some cases even if the charterer himself signed the bill of lading, but it is
unnecessary to consider any such question.’
This approach is consistent with that of Lord Sumner in the 
Elder Dempster
 
case
[1924] AC 522. In the 
Midland Silicones
 
case [1962] AC 446, Lord Keith of
Avonholm, at p. 481, and Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, at p. 494, spoke in similar
terms. Lord Reid, at p. 479, treated the decision on the point as: ‘an anomalous
and unexplained exception to the general principle that a stranger cannot rely for
his protection on provisions in a contract to which he is not a party’. Lord Denning
dissented, at pp. 481–492.
It has to be recognised that this reception did not enhance the reputation of the
Elder Dempster
 
case [1924] AC 522, as witness certain derogatory descriptions
later attached to it, for example by Donaldson J in 
Johnson Matthey & Co Ltd
 
v.
Constantine Terminals Ltd
 
[1976] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 215, 219—‘something of a judicial
nightmare’—and by Ackner LJ in 
The Forum Craftsman
 
[1985] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 291,
295—‘heavily comatosed, if not long-interred’.
Third, however, and most important, Lord Reid in the 
Midland Silicones
 
case
[1962] AC 446, while rejecting the agency argument on the facts of the case before
him, nevertheless indicated how it might prove successful in a future case. He
said, at p. 474:
‘I can see a possibility of success of the agency argument if (first) the bill of lading makes it clear that the
stevedore is intended to be protected by the provisions in it which limit liability, 
(secondly) the bill of
lading makes it clear that the carrier, in addition to contracting for these provisions on his own behalf, is
also contracting as agent for the stevedore that these provisions should apply to the stevedore, (thirdly)
the carrier has authority from the stevedore to do that, or perhaps later ratification by the stevedore
would suffice, and (fourthly) that any difficulties about consideration moving from the stevedore were
overcome.’
It was essentially on this passage that the Himalaya clause (called after the name
of the ship involved in 
Adler
 
v. 
Dickson
 
[1955] 1 QB 158) was later to be founded.
The pendulum swings back again
In more recent years the pendulum of judicial opinion has swung back again, as
recognition has been given to the undesirability, especially in a commercial
context, of allowing plaintiffs to circumvent contractual exception clauses by suing
in particular the servant or agent of the contracting party who caused the relevant
damage, thereby undermining the purpose of the exception, and so redistributing
the contractual allocation of risk which is reflected in the freight rate and in the
parties’ respective insurance arrangements. Nowadays, therefore, there is a
greater readiness, not only to accept something like Scrutton LJ’s doctrine of
vicarious immunity (as to which see, e.g., article 4 bis of the Hague-Visby Rules
scheduled to the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971) but also to rehabilitate the
Elder Dempster
 
case [1924] AC 522 itself, which has been described by Bingham
LJ, in 
Dresser UK Ltd
 
v. 
Falcongate Freight Management Ltd
 
[1992] QB 502, 511F
as ‘a pragmatic legal recognition of commercial reality’. Even so, the problem
remains how to discover, in circumstances such as those of the 
Elder Dempster
case [1924] AC 522, the factual basis from which the rendering of the bailment
subject to such a provision can properly be inferred. At all events the present
understanding, based on Lord Sumner’s speech, is that in the circumstances of
that case the shippers may be taken to have impliedly agreed that the goods were
received by the shipowners, as bailees, subject to the exceptions and limitations
contained in the known and contemplated form of bill of lading: see 
The Pioneer
Container
 
[1994] 2 AC 324, 339–340. Their Lordships will however put on one side
for later consideration the question how far the principle of bailment on terms may
be applicable in the present case, and will turn first to consider the principle
developed from Lord Reid’s observations in the 
Midland Silicones
 
case [1962] AC
446, 474, in 
The Eurymedon
 
[1975] AC 154 and 
The New York Star
 
[1981] 1 WLR
138.
The Eurymedon
 
and 
The New York Star
Their Lordships have already quoted the terms of clause 4 (the Himalaya clause)
of the bill of lading in the present case. For the purposes of this aspect of the case,
the essential passage reads as follows:
‘Without prejudice to the foregoing, every such servant, agent and subcontractor shall have the benefit of
all exceptions, limitations, provision, conditions and liberties herein benefiting the carrier as if such
provisions were expressly made for their benefit, and, in entering into this contract, the carrier, to the
extent of these provisions, does so not only on [his] own behalf, but also as agent and trustee for such
servants, agents and subcontractors.’
The effectiveness of a Himalaya clause to provide protection against claims in tort
by consignees was recognised by the Privy Council in 
The Eurymedon
 
[1975] AC
154 and 
The New York Star
 
[1981] 1 WLR 138. In both cases, stevedores were
sued by the consignees for damages in tort, in the first case on the ground that the
stevedores had negligently damaged a drilling machine in the course of unloading,
and in the second on the ground that they 
had negligently allowed a parcel of
goods, after unloading onto the wharf, to be removed by thieves without production
of the bill of lading. In both cases, the bill of lading contract incorporated a one
year time bar, and a Himalaya clause which extended the benefit of defences and
immunities to independent contractors employed by the carrier. The stevedores
relied upon the Himalaya clause to claim the benefit of the time bar as against the
consignees.
In 
The Eurymedon
 
[1975] AC 154 the Privy Council held, by a majority of three
to two, that the stevedores were entitled to rely on the time bar. The leading
judgment was delivered by Lord Wilberforce. … Referring to Lord Reid’s four
criteria in the 
Midland Silicones
 
case [1962] AC 446, 474, he considered it plain
that the first three were satisfied, the only question being whether the requirement
of consideration was fulfilled. He was satisfied that it was. He observed, at p.
167B, that ‘If the choice, and the antithesis, is between a gratuitous promise, and a
promise for consideration … there can be little doubt which, in commercial reality,
this is’. He then proceeded to analyse the transaction in a way which showed a
preference by him for what is usually called a unilateral contract, though he
recognised that there might be more than one way of analysing the transaction.
In 
The New York Star
 
[1981] 1 WLR 138, the Privy Council again upheld (on
this occasion unanimously) the efficacy of a Himalaya clause to confer upon the
stevedores the benefit of defences and immunities contained in the bill of lading,
including a one year time bar. The judgment of the Judicial Committee was again
given by Lord Wilberforce. In the course of his judgment, he stressed, at p. 143:
‘It may indeed be said that the significance of Satterthwaite’s case lay not so much in the establishment
of any new legal principle, as in the finding that in the normal situation involving the employment of
stevedores by carriers, accepted principles enable and require the stevedore to enjoy the benefit of
contractual provisions in the bill of lading.’
He continued, at p. 144:
‘Although, in each case, there will be room for evidence as to the precise relationship of carrier and
stevedore and as to the practice at the relevant port, the decision does not support, and their Lordships
would not encourage, a search for fine distinctions which would diminish the general applicability, in the
light of established commercial practice, of the principle.’
Lord Wilberforce in particular expressed the Board’s approval of the reasoned
analysis of the relevant legal principles in the judgment of Barwick CJ, which in his
opinion substantially agreed with, and indeed constituted a powerful reinforcement
of, one of the two possible bases put forward in the Board’s judgment in 
The
Eurymedon
 
[1975] AC 154. In his judgment in the court below (the High Court of
Australia), Barwick CJ saw no difficulty in finding that the carrier acted as the
authorised agent of the stevedores in making an arrangement with the consignor
for the protection of the stevedores: see [1979] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 298, 304–305. By
later accepting the bill of lading the consignee became party to that arrangement.
He could not read the clauses in the bill of lading as an unaccepted but acceptable
offer by the consignor to the stevedores. However the consignor and the
stevedores were ad idem through the carrier’s agency, upon the acceptance by the
consignor of the bill of lading, as to the protection the stevedores should have in
the event that they caused loss of or damage to the consignment. But that
consensus lacked consideration. He continued, at p. 305:
‘To agree with another that, in the event that the other acts in a particular way, that other shall be entitled
to stated protective provisions only needs performance by the doing of the specified act or acts to
become a binding contract. … The performance of the act or acts at the one moment satisfied the test
for consideration and enacted the agreed terms.’
Such a contract Barwick CJ was prepared, with some hesitation, to describe as a
bilateral contract.
Critique of 
The Eurymedon
 
principle
In 
The New York Star
 
[1981] 1 WLR 138, 144, Lord Wilberforce discouraged ‘a
search for fine distinctions which would diminish the general applicability, in the
light of established commercial practice, of the principle’. He was there, of course,
speaking of the application of the principle in the case of stevedores. It has
however to be recognised that, so long as the principle continues to be understood
to rest upon an enforceable contract as between the cargo owners and the
stevedores entered into through the agency of the shipowner, it is inevitable that
technical points of contract and agency law will continue to be invoked by cargo
owners seeking to enforce tortious remedies against stevedores and others
uninhibited by the exceptions and limitations in the relevant bill of lading contract.
Indeed, in the present case their Lordships have seen such an exercise being
legitimately undertaken by Mr Aikens on behalf of the cargo owners. In this
connection their Lordships wish to refer to the very helpful consideration of the
principle in 
Palmer on Bailment
, 2nd ed. (1991), at pp. 1610–1625, which reveals
many of the problems which may arise, and refers to a number of cases, both in
England and in Commonwealth countries, in which the courts have grappled with
those problems. In some cases, notably but by no means exclusively in England,
courts have felt impelled by the established principles of the law of contract or of
agency to reject the application of the principle in the particular case before them.
In others, courts have felt free to follow the lead of Lord Wilberforce in 
The
Eurymedon
 
[1975] AC 154, and of Lord Wilberforce and Barwick CJ in 
The New
York Star
 
[1981] 1 WLR 138; [1979] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 298, and so to discover the
existence of a contract (nowadays a bilateral contract of the kind identified by
Barwick CJ) in circumstances in which lawyers of a previous generation would
have been unwilling to do so.
Nevertheless there can be no doubt of the commercial need of some such
principle as this, and not only in cases concerned with stevedores; and the bold
step taken by the Privy Council in 
The Eurymedon
 
[1975] AC 154, and later
developed in 
The New York Star
 
[1981] 1 WLR 138, has been widely welcomed.
But it is legitimate to wonder whether that development is yet complete. Here their
Lordships have in mind not only Lord Wilberforce’s discouragement of fine
distinctions, but also the fact that the law is now approaching the position where,
provided that the bill of lading contract clearly provides that (for example)
independent contractors such as stevedores are to have the benefit of exceptions
and limitations contained in that contract, they will be able to enjoy the protection
of those terms as against the cargo owners. This is because (1) the problem of
consideration in these cases is regarded as having been solved on the basis that a
bilateral agreement between the stevedores and the cargo owners, entered into
through the agency of the shipowners, may, though itself unsupported by
consideration, be rendered enforceable by consideration subsequently furnished
by the stevedores in the form of performance of their duties as stevedores for the
shipowners; (2) the problem of authority from the stevedores to the shipowners to
contract on their behalf can, in the majority of cases, be solved by recourse to the
principle of ratification;
 
and (3) consignees of the cargo may be held to be bound
on the principle in 
Brandt
 
v. 
Liverpool, Brazil and River Plate Steam Navigation Co
Ltd
 
[1924] 1 KB 575. Though these solutions are now perceived to be generally
effective for their purpose, their technical nature is all too apparent; and the time
may well come when, in an appropriate case, it will fall to be considered whether
the courts should take what may legitimately be perceived to be the final, and
perhaps inevitable, step in this development, and 
recognise in these cases a fully-
fledged exception to the doctrine of privity of contract, thus escaping from all the
4
technicalities with which courts are now faced in English law. It is not far from their
Lordships’ minds that, if the English courts were minded to take that step, they
would be following in the footsteps of the Supreme Court of Canada: see 
London
Drugs Ltd
 
v. 
Kuehne & Nagel International Ltd
 
(1992) 97 DLR (4th) 261 and, in a
different context, the High Court of Australia: see 
Trident General Insurance Co Ltd
v. 
McNiece Bros Pty Ltd
 
(1988) 165 CLR 107. Their Lordships have given
consideration to the question whether they should face up to this question in the
present appeal. However, they have come to the conclusion that it would not be
appropriate for them to do so, first, because they have not heard argument
specifically directed towards this fundamental question, and second because, as
will become clear in due course, they are satisfied that the appeal must in any
event be dismissed.
Application of 
The Eurymedon
 
principle in the present case
Their Lordships now turn to the application of the principle in 
The Eurymedon
[1975] AC 154 to the facts of the present case. Two questions arose in the course
of argument which are specific to this case. The first is whether the shipowners
qualify as ‘subcontractors’ within the meaning of the Himalaya clause (clause 4 of
the bill of lading). The second is whether, if so, they are entitled to take advantage
of the exclusive jurisdiction clause (clause 19). Their Lordships have come to the
conclusion that the latter question must be answered in the negative. It is therefore
unnecessary for them to answer the first question …
[He then set out the reasoning that led to the conclusion that the exclusive
jurisdiction clause did not fall within the scope of the phrase ‘all exceptions,
limitations, provision, conditions, and liberties herein benefiting the carrier as if
such provisions were expressly made for their benefit’ in the Himalaya clause]
Application of the principle of bailment on terms in the present
case
In the light of the principle stated by Lord Sumner in the 
Elder Dempster
 
case
[1924] AC 522, 564, as interpreted by Fullagar J in the 
Darling Island
 
case, 95 CLR
43, 78, the next question for consideration is whether the shipowners can establish
that they received the goods into their possession on the terms of the bill of lading,
including the exclusive jurisdiction clause (clause 19)—i.e., whether the
shipowners’ obligations as bailees were effectively subjected to the clause as a
term upon which the shipowners implicitly received the goods into their
possession: see 
The Pioneer Container
 
[1994] 2 AC 324, 340, per Lord Goff of
Chieveley. …
Their Lordships feel able to deal with this point very briefly, because they
consider that in the present case there is an insuperable objection to the argument
of the shipowners. This is that the bill of lading under which the goods were
shipped on board contained a Himalaya clause under which the shipowners as
subcontractors were expressed to be entitled to the benefit of certain terms in the
bill of lading but, as their Lordships have held, those terms did not include the
exclusive jurisdiction clause. In these circumstances their Lordships find it
impossible to hold that, by receiving the goods into their possession pursuant to
the bill of lading, the shipowners’ obligations as bailees were effectively subjected
to the exclusive jurisdiction clause as a term upon which they implicitly received
the goods into their possession. Any such implication must, in their opinion, be
rejected as inconsistent with the express terms of the bill of lading.
Commentary
When describing the fluctuations in judicial opinion that have taken place Lord Goff
makes reference to four leading cases, namely 
Elder Dempster
, 
Midland Silicones
, 
The
Eurymedon
, and 
The New York Star
. One or two additional points can be made in
relation to each case.
Elder Dempster
 
was always a troublesome case and, as Lord Goff notes, it received a
distinctly frosty judicial reception in the latter half of the twentieth century. Lord Goff
points out that the case could be explained either on the basis of vicarious immunity or
as an example of bailment on terms. The former doctrine was rejected by the House of
Lords in 
Midland Silicones
 
with the consequence that the case must now be regarded as
an example of bailment on terms.
Midland Silicones
 
is a case in which the defendant stevedores sought to rely both on a
limitation clause in the contract between themselves and the carriers and on a limitation
clause in the contract between the cargo owners and the carriers. Two further aspects of
Midland Silicones
 
are worthy of note. The first is Lord Denning’s dissent. He held that
the cargo owners were bound by the terms of the contract between the carriers and the
stevedores on the basis that they impliedly authorized the carrier to employ the
stevedores on the terms that their liability would be limited. The second is Lord Reid’s
four-stage test (set out earlier in this section) which in many ways formed the basis for
future developments in 
The Eurymedon.
The Eurymedon
 
is an important case because the Privy Council there held, albeit by a
3–2 majority, that the stevedores were entitled to rely on the time bar in order to defeat
the claim brought by the consignors. In both 
The Eurymedon
 
and 
The New York Star
the leading judgment was given by Lord Wilberforce and in both cases he adopted a
rather broad brush approach in finding the existence of a contract between the
stevedores and the consignors which entitled the stevedores to rely on the time bar. The
dissentients in 
The Eurymedon
, while not denying that ‘a suitably drawn document
could bring a consignor and a stevedore into a relationship of obligation’ (p. 183) were
not prepared to paint with such a broad brush. Thus Viscount Dilhorne stated (at p. 175)
that:
clause 1 of the bill of lading was obviously not drafted by a layman but by a highly qualified lawyer. It is a
commercial document but the fact that it is of that description does not mean that to give it efficacy, one is at
liberty to disregard its language and read into it that which it does not say and could have said or construe the
English words it contains as having a meaning which is not expressed and which is not implied.
The clause does not in my opinion either expressly or impliedly contain an offer by the shipper to the carrier
to enter into an agreement whereby if the appellant performed services in relation to the goods the shipper
would give it the benefit of every exemption from and limitation of liability contained in the bill of lading.
So on what basis did Lord Wilberforce conclude that the stevedores and
consignors/shippers were contracting parties? As Lord Goff notes there are two possible
analyses: a unilateral contract or a bilateral contract. Lord Wilberforce himself adopted
a unilateral contract analysis in the following terms (at pp. 167–168):
[The present contract] is one of carriage from Liverpool to Wellington. The carrier assumes an obligation to
transport the goods and to discharge at the port of arrival. The goods are to be carried and discharged, so the
transaction is inherently contractual. It is contemplated that a part of this contract, viz. discharge, may be
performed by independent contractors—viz. the appellant. By clause 1 of the bill of lading the shipper agrees to
exempt from liability the carrier, his servants and independent contractors in respect of the performance of this
contract 
of carriage. Thus, if the carriage, including the discharge, is wholly carried out by the carrier, he is
exempt. If part is carried out by him, and part by his servants, he and they are exempt. If part is carried out by
him and part by an independent contractor, he and the independent contractor are exempt. The exemption is
designed to cover the whole carriage from loading to discharge, by whomsoever it is performed: the
performance attracts the exemption or immunity in favour of whoever the performer turns out to be. There is
possibly more than one way of analysing this business transaction into the necessary components; that which
their Lordships would accept is to say that the bill of lading brought into existence a bargain initially unilateral
but capable of becoming mutual, between the shipper and the appellant, made through the carrier as agent.
This became a full contract when the appellant performed services by discharging the goods. The performance
of these services for the benefit of the shipper was the consideration for the agreement by the shipper that the
appellant should have the benefit of the exemptions and limitations contained in the bill of lading. The
conception of a ‘unilateral’ contract of this kind was recognised in 
Great Northern Railway Co
 
v. 
Witham
(1873) LR 9 CP 16 and is well established. This way of regarding the matter is very close to if not identical to that
accepted by Beattie J in the Supreme Court: he analysed the transaction as one of an offer open to acceptance by
action such as was found in 
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic Smoke Ball Co
 
[1893] 1 QB 256. But whether one describes the
shipper’s promise to exempt as an offer to be accepted by performance or as a promise in exchange for an act
seems in the present context to be a matter of semantics. The words of Bowen LJ in 
Carlill
 
v. 
Carbolic Smoke
Ball Co
 
[1893] 1 QB 256, 268: ‘why should not an offer be made to all the world which is to ripen into a contract
with anybody who comes forward and performs the condition?’ seem to bridge both conceptions: he certainly
seems to draw no distinction between an offer which matures into a contract when accepted and a promise
which matures into a contract after performance, and, though in some special contexts (such as in connection
with the right to withdraw) some further refinement may be needed, either analysis may be equally valid.
The bilateral contract analysis adopted by Barwick CJ in 
The New York Star
 
[1979] 1
Lloyd’s Rep 298, 304–305 was in the following terms:
For my part, I find no difficulty in interpreting the arrangement made by the bill of lading and its acceptance by
the consignor as providing that if, in fact, the appellant stevedored the cargo, leaving aside for the moment what
the stevedoring involved, the appellant should have the benefit of the clauses of the bill including the benefit of
the time limitation expressed in cl. 17 of the bill of lading. I am unable to treat the clauses of the bill of lading as
in any respect an unaccepted but acceptable offer by consignor to stevedore. Indeed, I do not think the bill can
be interpreted as containing an offer at large by the consignor. The consignor and the appellant as stevedore
were ad idem through the carrier’s agency upon the acceptance by the consignor of the bill of lading as to the
protection the stevedore should have in the event that it stevedored the consignment. But this consensus lacked
the essential of consideration. The appellant through the bill of lading made no promise to stevedore the cargo.
Thus, while I would not analyse the situation obtaining on the acceptance of the bill of lading as an exchange of
promises, I would not analyse it as merely the making of an offer susceptible of acceptance by an act of the
stevedore done in purported acceptance of the offer. For this reason I have described the bill of lading in so far
as the carrier there purports to act for the appellant as an arrangement. To agree with another that, in the event
that the other 
acts in a particular way, that other shall be entitled to stated protective provisions only needs
performance by the doing of the specified act or acts to become a binding contract. Whether or not the
arrangement is susceptible of unilateral disavowal before the stated act is done need not be discussed. Here the
act was done. The performance of the act or acts at the one moment satisfied the test for consideration and
enacted the agreed terms. For myself and with due respect to those who find comfort in them, I find the
descriptions ‘unilateral and bilateral’ or ‘mutual’ unhelpful in the resolution of this case. Indeed, the use of them
seems to assume that they are mutually exclusive terms and together cover all possibilities. But I do not think
they do. Indeed, this bill of lading, as I read it, indicates in my opinion that they do not. As I see it, we have here
an arrangement, a compact with agreed conditions to attend the performance of certain acts, which are not
promised to be done. True enough that, until such performance, the consensus has nothing upon which to
operate. But that is its essential characteristic, to provide an agreed consequence to future action should that
action take place: to attach conditions to a relationship arising from conduct. If one desires to use the terms, it
could be said that the arrangement is mutual: it is bilateral: to it there are two parties both agreeing to the terms
of the intended consequence, on the one hand the consignor and on the other the stevedore acting through its
authorised agent, the carrier. The performance of the contemplated act both supplies the occasion for those
conditions to operate and the consideration which makes the arrangement contractual.
Neither solution is free from technical difficulties and, notwithstanding Lord
Wilberforce’s attempt in 
The New York Star
 
to discourage parties from taking technical
points, Lord Goff was surely correct in 
The Mahkutai
 
to state that it is ‘inevitable that
technical points of contract law and agency will continue to be taken’ while this line of
authority remains binding. The unilateral contract analysis is problematic for the
following reasons: (i) it may not be easy to identify the existence of the offer of immunity
by the consignor (the stumbling block for the minority in 
The Eurymedon
 
and for
Barwick CJ in 
The New York Star
); (ii) the third party may not be aware of the existence
of the offer at the time that it performs the act that constitutes the acceptance (an
acceptance performed in ignorance of the offer is not generally valid: see 
3.3.7
); and (iii)
the third party does not enjoy the immunity when it damages the goods when preparing
to undertake the task set out in the main contract (
Raymond Burke Motors Ltd
 
v.
Mersey Docks and Harbour Co
 
[1986] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 155). The latter problem also arises
in the context of the bilateral contract analysis. A further difficulty with the bilateral
contract analysis lies in ascertaining the precise moment in time at which the contract is
concluded. Finally, Professor Treitel states (
Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century
Contract Law
 
(Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 67) that he prefers Lord Wilberforce’s
analysis ‘since it avoids the consequence of the stevedore’s being in breach of a separate
contract with the cargo-owner if he has justifiably terminated his contract with the
carrier on account of the latter’s breach and consequently refused to unload the goods’.
Given these (and other) technical problems with the solutions adopted in 
The
Eurymedon
 
and 
The New York Star
, Lord Goff states in 
The Mahkutai
 
that the time
may come when the courts will develop ‘a fully-fledged exception to the doctrine of
privity of contract, thus escaping from all the technicalities with which courts are now
faced in English law’ (see further 
Homburg Houtimport BV
 
v. 
Agrosin Private Ltd (The
Starsin)
 
[2003] UKHL 12, [2004] 1 AC 715, where the House of Lords once again
discussed these issues in some detail but stopped short of creating a fully fledged
exception to the doctrine of privity). One of the cases to which Lord Goff makes
reference in this context is the decision of the Supreme 
Court of Canada in 
London
Drugs Ltd
 
v. 
Kuehne & Nagel International Ltd
 
(1992) 97 DLR (4th) 261. London Drugs
delivered an electrical transformer to Kuehne & Nagel for storage in a warehouse. The
contract between them contained a limitation clause which stated that ‘the
warehouseman’s liability on any one package is limited to $40 unless the holder has
declared in writing a valuation in excess of $40 and paid the additional charge specified
to cover warehouse liability’. The transformer was damaged as a result of the negligence
of two of Kuehne & Nagel’s employees. London Drugs brought a claim against Kuehne &
Nagel and their two employees. In relation to the claim against the employees, the issue
before the Supreme Court was whether or not the employees were entitled to rely on the
limitation clause, notwithstanding the fact the clause made no express mention of them.
It was held that they were entitled to invoke the benefit of the limitation clause. The
basis for this conclusion was later summarized by Iacobucci J, giving the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Canada in 
Fraser River Pile & Dredge Ltd
 
v. 
Can-Dive Services
Ltd
 
[2000] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 199, 205–206 in the following terms:
In order to distinguish mere strangers to a contract from those in the position of third-party beneficiaries, the
Court first established a threshold requirement whereby the parties to the contract must have intended the
relevant provision to confer a benefit on the third party. In other words, an employer and its customer may
agree to extend, either expressly or by implication, the benefit of any limitation of liability clause to the
employees. In the circumstances of 
London Drugs
, the customer had full knowledge that the storage services
contemplated by the contract would be provided not only by the employer, but by the employees as well. In the
absence of any clear indication to the contrary, the Court held that the necessary intention to include coverage
for the employees was implied in the terms of the agreement. The employees, therefore, as third-party
beneficiaries, could seek to rely on the limitation clause to avoid liability for the loss to the customer’s property.
The Court further held, however, that the intention to extend the benefit of a contractual provision to the
actions of a third-party beneficiary was irrelevant unless the actions in question came within the scope of
agreement between the initial parties. Accordingly, the second aspect of the functional inquiry was whether the
employees were acting in the course of their employment when the loss occurred, and whether in so acting they
were performing the very services specified in the contract between their employer and its customer. Based on
uncontested findings of fact, it was clear that the damage to the customer’s transformer occurred when the
employees were acting in the course of their employment to provide the very storage services specified in the
contract.
Taking all of these circumstances into account, the Court interpreted the term ‘warehouseman’ in the
limitation of liability clause to include coverage for the employees, thereby absolving them of any liability in
excess of Can$40 for the loss that occurred. The Court concluded that the departure from the traditional
doctrine of privity was well within its jurisdiction representing, as it did, an incremental change to the common
law rather than a wholesale abdication of existing principles. Given that the exception was dependent on the
intention stipulated in the contract, relaxing the doctrine of privity in the given circumstances did not frustrate
the expectations of the parties.
The effect of 
London Drugs
 
is, essentially, to introduce into Canadian law a form of
vicarious immunity, a principle rejected, as far as English law is concerned, by the
House of Lords in 
Midland Silicones
. Nevertheless, English cases can be found which
reach a 
similar result to that reached in 
London Drugs
, albeit by a different route. One
such case is 
Norwich City Council
 
v. 
Harvey
 
[1989] 1 WLR 828. Norwich City Council
employed contractors to construct an extension to a swimming pool. Clause 20(c) of the
contract provided that the building was at the sole risk of the employer as regards loss or
damage by fire and that the employer would maintain adequate insurance against those
risks. The contractors sub-contracted the roofing work to the defendants on the same
terms as those contained in the main contract. The property suffered extensive damage
as a result of a fire caused by the negligence of one of the defendants’ employees.
Norwich City Council sued the defendants in tort. The Court of Appeal held, having
regard to the contract structure adopted by the parties, that the defendants did not owe
a duty of care to the council. May LJ stated (at p. 837):
[A]pproaching the question on the basis of what is just and reasonable I do not think that the mere fact that
there is no strict privity between the employer and the subcontractor should prevent the latter from relying
upon the clear basis upon which all of the parties contracted in relation to damage to the employer’s building
caused by fire, even when due to the negligence of the contractors or subcontractors.
Earlier in his judgment May LJ stated (at p. 834) that ‘if in principle the subcontractor
owed no specific duty to the building owner in respect of damage by fire, then neither in
my opinion can any of its employees have done so’. It therefore followed that both the
defendants and their employees were absolved from responsibility for the consequences
of their negligence. The case differs from 
The Eurymedon
 
in that reliance was placed on
the contract structure, not for the purpose of finding the existence of a contract between
the defendants and the council, but for the purpose of negating the duty of care that
otherwise would have been owed by the defendants to the council. The difficulty with
Norwich City Council
 
is that in substance, but not in form, it appears to undermine the
House of Lords’ rejection of vicarious immunity in 
Midland Silicones
. It is therefore
difficult to ascertain the limits of the case. On the one hand it could be confined to its
own facts. On the other hand, it is possible that it could, in combination with cases such
as 
London Drugs
, form the building blocks for the construction of a broader exception
to the doctrine of privity. The merits of such a development are open to question. The
difficult case is one such as 
Adler
 
v. 
Dickson
 
[1955] 1 QB 158 where the plaintiff suffered
severe injuries when the gangway of a ship which she was boarding moved and she fell
from a height of sixteen feet. She brought an action in negligence against the members
of the crew. They sought to rely on the terms of an exclusion clause contained in the
ticket issued by the carrier. The Court of Appeal held that they were not entitled to do so.
The company had excluded its own liability and had not acted as an agent for its
employees. Further, the contract did not expressly exempt the employees from the
consequences of their negligence and the Court of Appeal refused to imply such an
exemption. But how would a case such as 
Adler
 
be decided on the basis of the principle
laid down in 
London Drugs
? The difference between the two cases may lie in the
position of the two plaintiffs. In 
London Drugs
 
the plaintiffs were found to have
accepted that the employees were entitled to rely on the limitation clause, whereas the
Court of Appeal in 
Adler
 
formed the view that the plaintiff had no such intention. If this
is the case, the ability of the employees to take the benefit of the exclusion or limitation
clause will hinge upon the state of knowledge of their employer’s customer, which
seems, at least from their perspective, to 
be a less than satisfactory conclusion. But it is
preferable to the alternative which is to deprive claimants of their rights of action
without their knowledge or assent. This being the case, 
Adler
 
would probably be decided
the same way even if 
London Drugs
 
were subsequently to be imported into English law.
Two other points remain to be made in relation to the judgment of Lord Goff in 
The
Mahkutai
. The first relates to his reference to 
The Pioneer Container
. The latter case is
distinguishable from 
The Mahkutai
 
because there the exclusive jurisdiction clause was
to be found in the sub-contract not the main contract. Thus the issue before the court in
The Pioneer Container
 
was not whether the sub-bailee could take the benefit of a clause
in a contract to which he was not a party (as it was in 
The Mahkutai
), but whether the
head bailor was bound by the terms of a clause in a contract to which he was not a party.
As Lord Goff points out, the latter question must be answered by reference to the
authority given by the head bailor to the intermediate bailor to act on his behalf when
agreeing to the term in the sub-bailment (on which see further Treitel, 
The Law of
Contract
 
(15th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2020, edited by Edwin Peel), para 14–081).
The final point relates to Lord Goff’s conclusion that the shipowners could not invoke
the exclusive jurisdiction clause on the facts of 
The Mahkutai
. His reason for reaching
this conclusion was, essentially, that the exclusive jurisdiction clause, unlike an
exclusion clause, was not a term that operated only for the benefit of the shipowner. It
was a term which created mutual rights and obligations and, while the shipowners,
being Indonesian, were content to be bound by it on the facts of the case, this would not
be so in every case. This being the case, the exclusive jurisdiction clause did not fall
within the scope of the Himalaya clause (whether the case would be decided differently
under the 1999 Act is discussed at 
25.3.6.6
).
25.3.5
 
The Case for Reform
Having considered the doctrine of privity of contract and the various exceptions to it, we
are now in a position to weigh up the arguments advanced both for and against reform
of the common law rule. The case for reform was put forward by the Law Commission
and their report formed the basis of the 1999 Act. They concluded as follows:
LAW COMMISSION, 
PRIVITY OF CONTRACT:
CONTRACTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THIRD PARTIES
(Law Com No 242, 1996), paras 3.1–3.28
1.
 
The Intention of the Original Contracting Parties are Thwarted
3.1 A first argument in favour of reform … is that the third party rule prevents effect
being given to the intention of the contracting parties. If the theoretical justification
for the enforcement of contracts is seen as the realisation of the promises or the
will or the bargain of the contracting parties, the failure of the law to afford a
remedy to the third party where the contracting parties intended that it should have
one frustrates their intentions, and undermines the general justifying theory of
contract.
2.
 
The Injustice to the Third Party
3.2 A second argument focuses on the injustice to the third party where a valid
contract, albeit between two other parties, has engendered in the third party
reasonable expectations 
of having the legal right to enforce the contract
particularly where the third party has relied on that contract to regulate his or her
affairs. In most circumstances this argument complements the above argument
based on the intentions of the contracting parties. For in most circumstances the
intentions of the contracting parties and the reasonable expectations of the third
party are consistent with each other. However, one of the most difficult issues that
we face is the extent to which the contracting parties can vary or discharge the
contract. That issue can be presented as raising the conflict between these two
fundamental arguments for reform. In other words, should the injustice to the third
party trump the intentions of the parties where those intentions change? As will
become clear, we believe that where the injustice to the third party is sufficiently
‘strong’ (that is, where the third party has not merely had expectations engendered
by knowledge of the contract but has relied on the contract or has accepted it by
communicating its assent to the promisor) it should trump the changed intentions
of the contracting parties. That is, the original parties’ right to change their minds
and vary the contract should be overridden once the third party has relied on, or
accepted, the contractual promise.
3.
 
The Person Who Has Suffered the Loss Cannot Sue, While the
Person Who Has Suffered No Loss Can Sue
3.3 In a standard situation, the third party rule produces the perverse, and unjust,
result that the person who has suffered the loss (of the intended benefit) cannot
sue, while the person who has suffered no loss can sue. This can be illustrated by
reference to 
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswic
k. In that case … the House of Lords held that the
widow could not enforce the promise in her personal capacity, since the contract
was one to which she was not privy. However, as administratrix of her husband’s
estate, she was able to sue as promisee, albeit that she could only recover
nominal damages because the uncle, and hence his estate, had suffered no loss
from the nephew’s breach. Hence we see that the widow in her personal capacity,
who had suffered the loss of the intended benefit, had no right to sue, while the
estate, represented by the widow in her capacity as administratrix, who had
suffered no loss, had that right. As it was, a just result was achieved by their
Lordships’ decision that nominal damages were, in this three party situation,
inadequate so that specific performance of the nephew’s obligation to pay the
annuity to the widow should be ordered in respect of the claim by the
administratrix. But where specific performance is not available (for example, where
the contract is not one supported by valuable consideration or where the contract
is one for personal service) the standard result is both perverse and unjust.
4.
 
Even if the Promisee Can Obtain a Satisfactory Remedy for the
Third Party, the Promisee May not be Able to, or Wish to, Sue
3.4 In 
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswick
, the promisee, as represented by the widow as
administratrix, clearly wanted to sue to enforce the contract made for her personal
benefit. However, in many other situations in which contracts are made for the
benefit of third parties, the promisee may not be able to, or wish to, sue, even if
specific performance or substantial damages could be obtained. Clearly the stress
and strain of litigation and its cost will deter many promisees who might fervently
want their contract enforced for the benefit of third parties. Or the contracting party
may be ill or outside the jurisdiction. And if the promisee has died, his or her
personal representatives may reasonably take the view that it is not in the interests
of the estate to seek to enforce a contract for the benefit of the third party.
5.
 
The Development of Non-Comprehensive Exceptions
3.5 A number of statutory and common law exceptions to the third party rule exist.
… Where an exception to the third party rule has been either recognised by case-
law or created by statute, the rule may now not cause difficulty. Self-evidently, this
is not the case where the situation is a novel one in which devices to overcome the
third party rule have not yet been tested. We believe that the existence of
exceptions to the third party rule is a strong justification for reform. This is for two
reasons. First, the existence of so many legislative and common law exceptions to
the rule demonstrates its basic injustice. Secondly, the fact that these exceptions
continue to evolve and to be the subject of extensive litigation demonstrates that
the existing exceptions have not resolved all the problems.

Complexity, Artificiality and Uncertainty
3.6 The existence of this rule, together with the exceptions to it, has given rise to a
complex body of law and to the use of elaborate and artificial stratagems and
structures in order to give third parties enforceable rights. Reform would enable the
artificiality and some of the complexity to be avoided. The technical hurdles which
must be overcome if one is to circumvent the rule in individual cases also lead to
uncertainty, since it will often be possible for a defendant to raise arguments that a
technical requirement has not been fulfilled. Such uncertainty is commercially
inconvenient.

Widespread Criticism Throughout the Common Law World
3.7 … we saw that there had been criticism of the third party rule and calls for its
reform from academics, law reform bodies and the judiciary. We shall see … that
the rule has been abrogated throughout much of the common law world, including
the United States, New Zealand, and parts of Australia. The extent of the criticism
and reform elsewhere is itself a strong indication that the privity doctrine is flawed.

The Legal Systems of Most Member States of the European
Union Allow Third Parties to Enforce Contracts
3.8 A further factor in support of reforming the third party rule in English law is the
fact that the legal systems of most of the member states of the European Union
recognise and enforce the rights of third party beneficiaries under contracts. In
France, for example, the general principle that contracts have effect only between
the parties to them is qualified by Art 1121 of the Code Civil, which permits a
stipulation for the benefit of a third party as a condition of a stipulation made for
oneself or of a gift made to another. The French courts interpreted this as
permitting the creation of an enforceable stipulation for a person in whose welfare
the stipulator had a moral interest. In so doing, they widened the scope of the
Article so as to permit virtually any stipulation for a third person to be enforced by
him or her, where the agreement between the stipulator and the promisor was
intended to confer a benefit on the third person. In Germany, contractual rights for
third parties are created by Art 328 of the 
Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch
 
permitting
stipulations in contracts for performances to third parties with the effect that the
latter acquires the direct right to demand performance, although the precise scope
of these rights depends on the terms and circumstances of the contract itself.
Surveying the member states of the European Union, we are aware that the laws
of France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg, and Greece recognise such rights (as does Scotland), whereas only
the laws of England and Wales (and Northern Ireland) and the Republic of Ireland
do not. With the growing recognition of the need for harmonisation of the
commercial law of the states of the European Union—illustrated most importantly
by the 
work being carried out by the Commission on European Contract Law under
the chairmanship of Professor Ole Lando—it seems likely that there will be ever
increasing pressure on the UK to bring its law on privity of contract into line with
that predominantly adopted in Europe.

The Third Party Rule Causes Difficulties in Commercial Life
3.9 Lest it be erroneously thought that the third party rule nowadays causes no real
difficulties in commercial life, or that the case for reform is purely theoretical rather
than practical, we have chosen two types of contracts—construction contracts and
insurance contracts—to illustrate some of the difficulties caused by the rule. …

Conclusion
3.28 For the reasons articulated above, we believe that a reform of the third party
rule is necessary. Contracting parties may not, under the present law, create
provisions in their contracts which are enforceable directly by a third party unless
they can take advantage of one of the exceptions to the third party rule. Our basic
philosophy for reform is that it should be straightforwardly possible for contracting
parties to confer on third parties the right to enforce the contract.
The arguments are not all one way, however. While most commentators have accepted
the validity of the arguments advanced by the Law Commission, there have been some
critical voices. The most sustained critical analysis of the Law Commission’s arguments
has been provided by Professor Stevens (R Stevens, ‘The Contracts (Rights of Third
Parties) Act 1999’ (2004) 120 
LQR
 
292) who provides a point-by-point response to the
arguments advanced by the Law Commission. In summary his views are as follows.
First, he points out that it is not entirely accurate to state that the denial of a third party
action has the consequence of thwarting the intentions of the original contracting
parties. The promisor’s intention is only thwarted in the sense that he has refused to
carry out the terms of his promise. It is the intention of the promisee which has not been
fulfilled but, as Stevens points out, this lack of fulfilment does not require that the third
party be provided with a remedy. Rather, it demands that the law fashion an effective
remedy for the promisee, to the extent that it has not done so already. He also points out
that ‘intentions have the unfortunate habit of changing’ and that the effect of conferring
a right of action on the third party may be to deny to the original contracting parties the
right to change their minds by taking away the entitlement of the third party.
Secondly, he disputes the proposition that the common law rule results in injustice to
the third party. In his view, ‘it may be queried how deserving of sympathy a party who
relies upon a promise made to someone else is’. The party who has a legitimate
expectation that the promise will be kept is the party to whom the promise was made,
namely the promisee. This is a point to which we shall return.
Thirdly, he challenges the validity of the claim that the person who has suffered the loss
cannot sue, while the person who has suffered no loss can sue. Here his argument turns
in large part on the decision of the House of Lords in 
Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd
v. 
Panatown Ltd
 
[2001] 1 AC 518 (see 
23.3.2
) and the extent to which that decision
plugs any gaps that exist in the law. He notes that the ‘weight of authority would seem to
favour allowing the promisee to recover substantial damages for his own loss in the
situation where the lacuna is said to exist’ and that the ‘keenest supporters of the
[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999] are strongly critical of this approach’.
Further, he points out that, even if there is a lacuna in the law, it does not justify
conferring a cause of action on the third party: it suffices to ‘reform the remedies
available to the promisee’.
Fourthly, while he accepts that the promisee may not be able to sue or wish to sue, he
points out that it is for the promisee to decide whether or not to enforce his rights and, if
he chooses not to do so or is unable to do so, that does not justify the conferral of a right
of action on a third party. It is for the promisee to decide what is to be done with his
rights.
Fifthly, Professor Stevens claims that some of the alleged exceptions to the privity rule
are not in fact true exceptions and, to the extent that they are exceptions, the existence
of the present exceptions does not justify the creation of a further exception.
Sixthly, in so far as the common law is said to be complex, artificial, and uncertain, he
points out that the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 has not simplified the
law; on the contrary, it has made the law more complex. Further, to the extent that the
common law solutions in cases such as 
The Eurymedon
 
[1975] AC 154 can be said to be
artificial, Stevens’ response is to advocate the adoption of a solution which is less
artificial and ‘more readily defensible’. Finally, he points to a number of uncertainties in
the Act itself so that, once again, it cannot be said that the Act has reduced the
uncertainty in the law.
Seventhly, while the existence of widespread criticism of the privity rule throughout the
common law world should give us ‘pause for thought’, it does not ‘necessarily
demonstrate that English law is wrong and other systems are right’.
Eighthly, in relation to the claim that the legal systems of most Member States of the
European Union allow third parties to enforce contracts, he points out that Roman law
did not recognize third party rights arising from contracts and that it is necessary to see
the third party rule in modern European legal systems in their context. In particular,
some European legal systems look to the law of contract to do work which in English law
is done by the law of tort. The reality is that English law, French law, and German law
(for example) recognize the existence of third party rights in different situations so that
it is not true to say that there is a ‘European consensus with which English law is out of
line’.
Finally, he doubts the validity of the claim that privity causes difficulties in commercial
life. He examines the claim that the privity rule causes difficulties in the context of
construction contracts and insurance contracts. In the case of construction contracts, he
concludes that ‘it is unlikely that the Act will have significant impact in the construction
industry’ and in the case of insurance contracts he claims that the Act ‘fails to address
the real source of difficulty’ in that it is likely to be of ‘little assistance to third party
beneficiaries under insurance contracts when in competition with the creditors or the
estate of the insured’.
The heart of the debate relates to the justice of giving a right of action to the third party.
Two principal arguments have been advanced in support of the proposition that justice
does not demand the recognition of a third party right of action. The first is that the
third party is not a promisee and the second is that the third party has not provided any
consideration for the promisor’s promise. The first argument is developed in the
following extract:
SA SMITH, ‘
CONTRACTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THIRD
PARTIES: IN DEFENCE OF THE THIRD-PARTY RULE
’
(1997) 7 
OJLS
 
643, 645–646
Defending the Third Party Rule
A simplified example is helpful in discussing the third-party rule. I will refer to the
following case as the ‘gardening contract’:
A agrees with B that in return for B paying A £100, A will do C’s gardening for
one year (C is B’s sister). A receives the money, does C’s gardening for one
month, and then goes on holiday for the rest of the year.
The effect of the third-party rule is to preclude C (the third party) from
successfully suing A (the promisor) for the value (to C) of A’s promise to B: in other
words, the third-party rule prevents C from enforcing the contract.
How can this result be justified? The justification, it is suggested, flows from the
nature of contractual obligations as voluntary obligations. The specific type of
voluntary obligation (promise, agreement, consent, etc.) to which contractual
obligations give rise is not important for our purposes: for ease of expression I will
adopt conventional terminology and refer to contractual obligations as promissory
obligations. What is important is that voluntary obligations, of whatever stripe, do
not exist in the air: they are obligations undertaken to particular persons, extending
to and only to those persons. A promise is formed by communicating an intention
to undertake an obligation. The communication must be addressed to (and
received by) the person to whom the obligation is undertaken. This is a general
feature of voluntary obligations. In the case of a vow the obligation is addressed to
and undertaken to oneself. In the case of a promise the obligation is undertaken to
the addressee of the promise. The promissory obligation thus created is an
obligation between the person undertaking it, the promisor, and the person to
whom the obligation was given, the promisee. Thus the reason that C in our
example should not be able to enforce A’s promise is the simple but profound fact
that A did not make a promise to C. The promisor A has a duty to perform his
promise, but the duty is owed to B, the promisee, not to C.
That promisees and non-promisees are in a different position vis-à-vis the
enforcement of a promise is a well-recognised feature of ordinary moral reasoning.
Few would dispute that there is a difference between B in our example saying ‘but
you promised me you would do it’ and C saying, ‘but I heard you promise B that
you would do it’. It is because of this difference that we get more upset, and with
good reason, at promise-breakers when the promise broken was made to us than
when it was made to someone else, even if the practical consequences are the
same in each case. Indeed, that promisees and non-promisees are in a different
position regarding the enforceability of a promise is accepted by even the
strongest critics of the third-party rule. No one suggests that just anyone should be
able to sue on a (legally valid) promise and no legal system allows just anyone to
sue. Only some third parties should be able to sue. But if there is a difference
between third parties and promisees, what is it? The difference cannot be merely
that third parties have not provided consideration … no one supposes that were
consideration abolished then just anyone would be able to sue on a promise and in
legal systems without a requirement of consideration this clearly is not the case.
Nor can the difference be that promisees are more likely than third parties to rely
on the promise … the short response to this suggestion is that reliance is not
relevant to the existence of promissory obligation. Promises may bind even when
they have not been relied upon. The only possible significance of the distinction is
the most obvious one: the promisee alone is the person to whom the promissory
duty is owed. Thus only the promisee can complain of the promise qua promise
being broken. This is what it means to be a promisee; and it is why contractual
rights have always been understood, correctly, as personal rights.
The distinction that is drawn here by Smith is between a promisee and a third party.
Thus a third party is a party to whom a promise of performance has not been made. It
follows from this that a third party to whom a promise of performance is made must
have a right to enforce that promise. Thus Smith continues (at p. 648):
in some privity cases one or both of the contracting parties may have communicated to the third party an
intention to undertake an obligation to that party … where such an intention has been communicated the third-
party rule is not a bar to the third party bringing an action in 
contract (the primary bar is consideration). This is
because where one or both of the contracting parties communicate to the third party an intention to be bound to
that party, the requirements for promissory obligation are satisfied. A promise has been made to the third party.
Thus, the third party is not a third party to the agreement made with her, but only to the agreement made
between the other two parties. It remains to add only that it is crucial to distinguish this sort of intention (the
intention to undertake an obligation) from a mere intent to benefit another or to grant another person legal
rights. If X says ‘it is my desire and intention to give Y £100 on 1 December’ no contract has been created (even
ignoring consideration). The same is true if X says ‘I grant Y the right to cross over my property’. Assuming that
X’s words were intended to be understood in their ordinary sense, the reason no contract is created is that while
X has intended to do something (to pay a sum of money, to grant a legal right), he has not communicated an
intention to put himself under an obligation to do something for Y.
The Law Commission respond to this argument in a footnote located at the end of
paragraph 3.1 (extracted earlier). They refer to an article by Kincaid (1994) 8 
JCL
 
51
where Kincaid argues in similar terms that only a promisee can enforce the promise. The
Law Commission respond by stating that ‘in our view, this is to take an unnecessarily
narrow view of the morality of promise-keeping where a promise is intended to benefit a
third party’. Does this answer the points made by Smith and Kincaid?
The second objection is that the third party has not provided any consideration. Thus
Kincaid has argued (‘Third Parties: Rationalising A Right to Sue’ [1989] 
CLJ
 
243, 244–
245):
Although frequently no coherent justification is offered for the proposition that it is unjust not to allow third
parties to sue, when one is given it is usually that the promisor should not be allowed to get away with breaking
his promise. My view is that such an approach is inconsistent with the common-law attitude to civil liability
generally. The common law’s concern in civil liability is to give redress to the plaintiff, not to punish the
defendant. This attitude may be contrasted with the moral flavour of the criminal law, where the focus is on the
wrongdoing of the defendant. To use such a focus as the rationale for third-party rights is to depart radically
from the common law’s approach to promissory liability. If such a departure is desirable, it should be the result
of a conscious choice.
Bargain is the common law’s present general theory which answers the question, who should be able to
enforce promises. The answer is, anyone to whom a promise was made and who has paid the price for it
requested of him by the promisor. The plaintiff establishes his right by showing a change in his ‘condition’
(suffering a detriment as the consideration) and by showing a ‘link’ to the defendant (the request) which makes
it just that the defendant should be responsible for loss suffered by the plaintiff as the result of these two
factors.
Clearly the third party cannot qualify as a plaintiff under the bargain theory. He has suffered no detriment at
the request of the promisor …
Kincaid’s point is not that the third party should not have a right to sue but that
recognition of such a right would entail the development of a new theory of promissory
liability and that theory would have to encompass gratuitous promisees as well as third
parties. But is it the case that the third party is in the same position as a gratuitous
promisee? Does the fact that the promisee has provided consideration not make a
difference? The third party is not seeking to enforce a wholly gratuitous promise. While
it may be gratuitous as far as the third party is concerned, the promisee has paid for the
promise. But this argument would appear 
to lead to the conclusion that the right of
action belongs in truth to the promisee and not to the third party. However that may be,
the arguments of the Law Commission won the day and their report led to the
enactment of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
25.3.6
 
Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act
1999
The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 can now be said to be the principal
source of the law relating to third party rights of action. The Act aims to provide a simple
mechanism by which two contracting parties can give to a third party the right to
enforce a term of their contract. However, the Act is not a straightforward piece of
legislation and it requires careful analysis. It will therefore be set out section by section
and brief comments will follow most sections.

(a)
(b)
Right of third party to enforce contractual term
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person who is not a party to a contract (a ‘third party’) may in
his own right enforce a term of the contract if—
the contract expressly provides that he may, or
subject to subsection (2), the term purports to confer a benefit on him.
Subsection (1)(b) does not apply if on a proper construction of the contract it appears that the parties did
not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party.
The third party must be expressly identified in the contract by name, as a member of a class or as
answering a particular description but need not be in existence when the contract is entered into.
This section does not confer a right on a third party to enforce a term of a contract otherwise than
subject to and in accordance with any other relevant terms of the contract.
For the purpose of exercising his right to enforce a term of the contract, there shall be available to the
third party any remedy that would have been available to him in an action for breach of contract if he
had been a party to the contract (and the rules relating to damages, injunctions, specific performance
and other relief shall apply accordingly).
Where a term of a contract excludes or limits liability in relation to any matter references in this Act to
the third party enforcing the term shall be construed as references to his availing himself of the exclusion
or limitation.
In this Act, in relation to a term of a contract which is enforceable by a third party—
‘the promisor’ means the party to the contract against whom the term is enforceable by the third
party, and
‘the promisee’ means the party to the contract by whom the term is enforceable against the
promisor.
Commentary
Section 1 establishes two separate tests of enforceability, the first to be found in section
1(1)(a) and section 1(3) and the second in section 1(1)(b) and section 1(3). The scope of
these two tests has been set out by Professor Burrows, the Law Commissioner primarily
responsible for the Law Commission report on which the Act was based, in the following
terms:
A BURROWS, ‘
THE CONTRACTS (RIGHTS OF THIRD
PARTIES) ACT AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR
COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS
’
[2000] 
LMCLQ
 
540, 542–546
The first, and simplest [test of enforceability], is in s.1(1)(a) and s.1(3). By s.1(1)(a)
a third party has a right to enforce a term of the contract where the contract
expressly provides that he may. This is satisfied where the contract contains words
such as ‘and C shall have the right to enforce the contract’ or ‘C shall have the
right to enforce terms 25, 26 and 27 of the contract’ or ‘C shall have the right to
sue’. Section 1(3) makes clear that the third party does not have to be named (e.g.
Joe Smith or X Co). Rather it is sufficient if the third party is expressly identified in
the contract as a member of a class (eg, stevedores, subsequent owners,
subsequent tenants) or as answering a particular description (eg, ‘person living at
3 Coronation Street’ or ‘B’s nominee’). And the third party does not need to be in
existence when the contract is made, so that contracting parties may confer rights
on an unborn child, a future spouse, or a company that has not yet been
incorporated.
The first test—as clarified in s.1(6)—also covers ‘negative rights’ (ie, exclusion
and limitation clauses) conferred on expressly identified third parties. So, for
example, in a head building contract between an employer and head-contractor, if
there is a term excluding liability on the part of all subcontractors, and the
employers sue a subcontractor in the tort of negligence for damage to the building,
the subcontractor will be able to rely on the exclusion clause by reason of s.1(1)
(a). Additional words, such as ‘and the third party shall be entitled to rely on that
exclusion or limitation clause’, over and above words clarifying that the clause is
for the third party’s benefit, seem unnecessary. This is because, by definition, an
exclusion or limitation clause is intended to affect the legal rights of beneficiaries of
such clauses. The Act therefore provides a solution to the problems raised by
cases in the construction industry on exclusion clauses, such as 
Norwich City
Council
 
v. 
Harvey
. It also produces a solution to the even-better known ‘Himalaya
clause’ difficulties in contracts for the carriage of goods by sea where stevedores
wish to take advantage of exclusion clauses in the main contract of carriage to
protect them against claims by the owner for negligent damage to the goods in
unloading them. …
Less straightforward, and less clear-cut, is the second test of enforceability,
which is in section 1(1)(b) and 1(3). If s.1(1)(a) is concerned with the express
conferral of rights on a third party, we can say that the second test is concerned
with the implied conferral of rights on a third party.
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
The Act has been criticised in some quarters for including this second test. It
has been argued that everything would have been much more certain if there had
just been the first test. But there are a number of important justifications for
including the second test. I mention here three of them.
Contractual rights as between two parties are not merely a matter of
express rights. Rather they include implied rights through the concept of
implied terms. Just as the normal law of contract would be artificially
restricted if one confined it to express terms, so the same applies to third
party rights. Put another way, if one is seeking to effect parties’ intentions,
these are not necessarily expressed intentions.
Examination of past cases coming before the courts where privity has
caused problems shows that a reform confined to an express conferral of
rights would not solve many of the problems. For example, cases
concerning A contracting with B to pay money to C, such as 
Beswick
 
v.
Beswick
 
and 
Woodar
 
v. 
Wimpey
; the booking of a holiday for family
members or friends, as in 
Jackson
 
v. 
Horizon Holidays
; or the taking out of
liability insurance designed to protect third parties to the contract, as in
Trident General Insurance Co Ltd
 
v. 
McNiece Bros.
 
In all of these well-
known cases, unless the parties included a magic 
formula so as to fall
within the first test (eg, ‘and the third party shall have the right to enforce
the term’), the 1999 Act would not have improved the position of the third
parties.
Closely linked to the second point is that a magic formula within the first test
will only be used in well-drafted contracts. But not all contracts are well
drafted, and in the consumer sphere good legal advice may not be
affordable.
For those sorts of reasons the Act contains a second test of enforceability
according to which a third party will have a right to enforce a term if three
conditions are satisfied: first, the term purports to confer a benefit on him (s.1(1)
(b)); secondly, he is expressly identified by name, class or description (s.1(3));
unless, on a proper construction of the contract the parties did not intend the term
to be enforceable by him (s.1(2)).
The second test therefore uses a rebuttable presumption of intention. … It is
this rebuttable presumption that provides the essential balance between sufficient
certainty for contracting parties and the flexibility required for the reform to deal
fairly with a huge range of different situations. The presumption is based on the
idea that, if you ask yourself, ‘When is it that parties are likely to have intended to
confer rights on a third party to enforce a term, albeit that they have not expressly
conferred that right’, the answer will be: ‘Where the term purports to confer a
benefit on an expressly identified third party’. That then sets up the presumption.
But the presumption can be rebutted if, as a matter of ordinary contractual
interpretation, there is something else indicating that the parties did not intend
such a right to be given.
So, if money is to be paid by A not to B but to an expressly identified third party
C, the presumption is that C has the right to enforce that term. But that
presumption can be rebutted. For example, there may be an express term of the
contract laying down that C shall have no right of enforceability. Or the rebuttal
may occur because of other inconsistent terms. For example, the contract may
prohibit assignment to C of B’s right to enforce the payment without A’s written
consent. That would indicate that the parties did not intend to confer on C an
immediate right of enforceability.
There are two main additional points to make on this second test. First … the
words ‘purport to confer a benefit on’ the third party are designed to ensure that the
presumption is triggered only where the third party is to receive a benefit directly
from the promisor. They are not designed to cover consequential or incidental
benefits stemming from the promisor’s performance. Professor Treitel gives a very
good example. If A were employed by B to ‘cut my (B’s) hedge adjoining C’s land’,
performance by A might benefit C but the term would not purport to confer a benefit
on C. Similarly, a solicitor’s contractual obligation to use reasonable care in
drawing up a will would not, 
vis-à-vis
, the beneficiaries of that will, fall within s.1(1)
(b) because the term does not purport to confer a benefit on the beneficiaries of
the will; the benefit to them derives from the testator not from the solicitor, whose
role is to enable his client, at the client’s discretion, to confer a benefit on the
beneficiaries. …
Secondly, what material can be used in determining the proper construction of
the contract under s.1(2)? The idea was that the normal objective approach to
contractual interpretation should be applied, subject to there being a reversed
burden of proof …
So much, then, for the two tests of enforceability. It can be seen that a contract
draftsman can make the position absolutely certain; either by giving identified third
parties express rights to enforce particular terms so as to fall within the first test; or
by saying that third parties shall not have the right to enforce particular terms or
indeed any terms. If a contract draftsman does not want anything to do with the
1999 Act, a simple standard term, such as the following, can be included: ‘A
person who is not a party to this agreement shall have no right under the Contracts
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms [except and to the
extent that this agreement expressly provides for such Act to apply to any of its
terms]’.
It should be noted that that term seems preferable, generally speaking, to
merely saying: ‘A person who is not a party to this agreement shall have no right to
enforce any of its terms’. This formulation would exclude any right of a third party
which exists apart from the 1999 Act (eg, by assignment or trust of the promise or
existing statutory exceptions) and this may not be what is intended.
The concern has been expressed that, if the contract draftsman does not say
anything expressly one way or the other, the 1999 Act can lead to unintended
liabilities being imposed on the parties. If that were the case it would certainly
contradict the purpose of the second test, which is to give effect to the parties’
intentions, albeit by using a presumption. If applying normal objective rules of
construction, including implied terms, neither contracting party intended to confer a
right on a third party, the presumption would be rebutted and no right would be
conferred on the third party. The real concern, I would suggest, is that one party
(the promisor) might conceivably find itself landed with an obligation to a third party
that it subjectively did not intend to undertake; but unintended liabilities in that
sense are a risk of any contract, given objective interpretation. …
What does the right of enforceability mean? This is laid down in s.1(5). The
third party has the same remedies for breach of the contractual term as if he had
been a party to the contract. He can therefore recover expectation (or reliance)
damages for his own loss (subject to normal restrictions, for example, remoteness
or the duty to mitigate). Or applying analogous rules to those normally applied, the
third party may be awarded specific performance or an injunction.
25.3.6.1.1
 
Expressly identified
A number of points arise here. The first relates to the requirement in section 1(3) that
the third party must be expressly identified in the contract. A failure to identify the third
party has the consequence that the third party cannot rely upon the Act. The word
‘expressly’ is important in this context; it has been held that it precludes identification of
the third party by a process of implication (
Avraamides
 
v. 
Colwill
 
[2006] EWCA Civ
1533, [2007] BLR 76), although it does permit a court to identify the third party by a
process of construction of the contract as a whole (
Chudley
 
v. 
Clydesdale Bank plc
(trading as Yorkshire Bank)
 
[2019] EWCA Civ 344, [2020] QB 284). The requirement
set out in section 1(3) is separate from that to be found in section 1(1)(b) and, while the
requirements of both provisions must be satisfied if the third party is to be entitled to
assert a third party right under the Act, a single term of the contract can in principle
satisfy the requirements of both provisions (
Chudley
).
25.3.6.1.2
 
Purports to confer a benefit
The second relates to the meaning of the words ‘purports to confer a benefit’ on the third
party in section 1(1)(b). It has proved to be a relatively easy test for third parties to
satisfy (see, for example, 
Nisshin Shipping Co Ltd
 
v.

of Appeal subsequently allowed an appeal from the decision of Lindsay J but, on the
view which they took of the 
meaning of the deed, no question arose in relation to the
scope of the 1999 Act: [2008] EWCA Civ 52) the requirements of the subsection are
satisfied if on a true construction of the term in question its sense has the effect of
conferring a benefit on the third party in question. There is no requirement that the
benefit on the third party must be the predominant purpose or intent behind the term or
that the subsection is inapplicable if a benefit is conferred on someone other than the
third party (
Cavanagh
 
v. 
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
 
[2016] EWHC 1136
(QB), [2016] ICR 826). However, a contract does not purport to confer a benefit on a
third party simply because the position of that third party will be improved if the
contract is performed. One of the purposes of the contract must have been to benefit the
third party. The fact that the third party has obtained an incidental benefit as a result of
performance will not suffice (

25.3.6.1.3
 
The scope of section 1(2)
This leads on to the third point, which relates to the scope of section 1(2). A third party
who satisfies the modest requirements of section1(1)(b) may be defeated by section 1(2).
But, in relation to that subsection, the onus of proof is upon the party who alleges that
section 1(1)(b) has been disapplied (
Nisshin Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
Cleaves & Co Ltd
 
[2003]
EWHC 2602 (Comm), [2004] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 38). The easiest way to manifest an
intention that the term is not to be enforceable by the third party is for the contracting
parties to insert an express term to this effect in their contract. But the cases which come
before the courts are cases in which the parties have not resorted to this relatively
simple expedient. The difficulty which they then encounter is that silence is a difficult
basis from which to argue that the contracting parties did not intend to confer a right of
action upon the third party. As Colman J observed in 
Nisshin Shipping
 
at [23], it does
not suffice for the contracting parties to prove that the contract is ‘neutral’: they must
prove that they did not intend third party enforcement in order to negate the existence
of the third party right. In the absence of an express term negating the existence of a
third party right, contracting parties have resorted to two techniques in an attempt to
persuade the court that they did not intend to confer a right of action upon the third
party under the Act.
The first is to assert that the third party already has a right of action so that it is
unnecessary to confer a further right of action under the Act. This technique was
employed in 
Nisshin Shipping
 
where it was argued that the third party did not have a
right of action under the Act because the contracting parties intended to create a trust of
a promise in favour of the third party (on which see 
25.3.3.2
). Colman J rejected this
submission and held that the 1999 Act provided a much simpler method by which the
third party could enforce its rights and, this being the case, it could not be inferred that
the parties had intended to confine the rights of the third party to those arising under
the trust and to deny it the right to rely on the 1999 Act. Thus it cannot be said that it
follows from the fact that the third party has an existing, limited right of action that the
contracting parties intended to exclude the existence of a right of action under the Act.
The second technique is to argue that the recognition of a third party right under the Act
would be inconsistent with the contractual structure which the contracting parties have
set up (on which see 
25.2
). This possibility was recognized by the Law Commission in
paragraph 7.18 of its report where it stated:
[W]e should clarify that … we do not see our second limb as cutting across the chain of sub-contracts that have
traditionally been a feature of [the construction] industry. For example, we do not think that in normal
circumstances an owner would be able to sue a sub-contractor for breach of the latter’s contract with the head-
contractor. This is because, even if the sub-contractor has promised to confer a benefit on the expressly
designated owner, the parties have deliberately set up a chain of contracts which are well understood in the
construction industry as ensuring that a party’s remedies lie against the other contracting party only.
An unsuccessful attempt was made to rely on this passage for the purpose of negating
the existence of a third party right of action in 
Laemthong International Lines Co Ltd
 
v.
Artis (The Laemthong Glory) (No 2)
 
[2005] EWCA Civ 519, [2005] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 688.
The owners of a vessel chartered it to charterers. Cargo was loaded on the vessel and it
was consigned to the receivers. The vessel arrived at its destination before the bill of
lading and so an arrangement was made to deliver the cargo to the receivers in return
for letters of indemnity. The charterers issued a letter of indemnity in favour of the
owners, and the receivers in turn issued one which was addressed to the charterers. The
central issue between the parties was whether the owners were entitled to enforce the
letter of indemnity against the receivers. The receivers sought to prove that the
contracting parties did not intend the terms of the receivers’ letter of indemnity to be
enforceable by the owners by relying upon the ‘chain’ of indemnities which the parties
had created. In essence their submission was that the receivers had given an indemnity
to the charterers and that the charterers had given an indemnity to the owners. In these
circumstances, the receivers submitted, the owners could not jump up the chain of
contracts and enforce the letter of indemnity given by the receivers. The Court of Appeal
rejected this submission. In essence they held (at [52]–[54]) that there was no
established practice of the type found by the Law Commission to exist in the
construction industry which negated the existence of the third party right of action.
Thus the key to the example provided by the Law Commission is probably the
understanding and the practice of the construction industry. Where contracts are linked
sequentially but there is no proven understanding that the sequence of contracts
prevents recourse to a third party right of action, the linked nature of the contracts will
not of itself preclude the existence of a third party right of action under the 1999 Act (see
also 
Great Eastern Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
Far East Chartering Ltd (The Jag Ravi)
 
[2012]
EWCA Civ 180, [2012] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 637).
25.3.6.1.4
 
Applying the Act to case law which pre-dates the Act
Another way of attempting to ascertain the limits of section 1 is to apply it to the facts of
cases decided prior to the enactment of the 1999 Act. This is not always an easy task
because the parties, at the time of these cases, were operating on the assumption that
the law did not recognize a third party right of action of the type contained in the 1999
Act. 
Tweddle
 
v. 
Atkinson
 
(
25.3.1
) would appear to fall within the scope of section 1(1)(a)
because the contract between John Tweddle and William Guy expressly stated that
William Tweddle was to have the right to enforce the contract. On the other hand, 
White
v. 
Jones
 
(
25.3.3.6
) satisfies neither test. The wording of section 1(1)(b) will not stretch to
the 
White
 
v. 
Jones
 
fact situation because the undertaking of the solicitor to exercise
reasonable care and skill does not purport to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. Section
1(6) deals with exclusion and limitation clauses and provides a much simpler
mechanism by which the benefit of such clauses can be extended to third parties (and so
would appear to cover 
The Eurymedon
 
type case, 
25.3.4
).
Slightly more difficult are cases such as 
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswick
 
(
25.3.2.1
) and 
Jackson
 
v.
Horizon Holidays Ltd
 
(
25.3.2.3
). Professor Burrows implies that they would now fall
within the scope 
of the 1999 Act and this is confirmed by the Law Commission report at
paragraphs 7.46 and 7.40 respectively. In relation to 
Beswick
 
the Law Commission state
(at para 7.46):
[T]he provision of old Mr Beswick’s contract with his nephew providing for payment of an annuity to Mrs
Beswick would give Mrs Beswick a presumed right of enforceability under our second limb. The nephew
promised to confer the benefit (the annuity payments) on Mrs Beswick, who was expressly named. The
presumption could only be rebutted if the nephew could demonstrate that, on the proper construction of the
contract, he and old Mr Beswick had no intention at the time of contracting that Mrs Beswick should have the
right to enforce the provision. In our view, the nephew would not be able to satisfy the onus of proof so that Mrs
Beswick would have the right of enforcement.
It is certainly the case that the 1999 Act makes it easier for the parties to confer an
enforceable right of action on the third party. But it does not necessarily follow that
Beswick
 
would now fall within the scope of the Act. Professor Treitel has expressed his
doubts on this score. He points out (
Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract
Law
 
(Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 87) that the agreement concluded between
Peter and John Beswick was drawn up by a solicitor and that ‘it would have been so easy
for the solicitor to have drawn up the agreement so as to confer enforceable rights on
Ruth [i.e., Mrs Beswick]’. It could have been done by, for example, making her a party to
the agreement. Why did the solicitor not confer enforceable rights on Ruth? One
possible answer, which Professor Treitel is reluctant to adopt in the absence of any
evidence, is that the solicitor was negligent. The other possibility suggested by Professor
Treitel is that:
he was simply carrying out his instructions. We have no way of knowing what passed between him and his
clients on 14 March 1962; but there is a possibility of his having told Peter and John (1) that they could create
legally enforceable rights in favour of Ruth but (2) that if they did so, their right to vary their contract would be
lost or limited. Peter and John might not have liked that idea and instructed him accordingly.
This latter possibility is significant in terms of the application of the Act. As Professor
Treitel points out, the requirements of section 1(1)(a) were not satisfied, in that the
agreement did not expressly provide that Mrs Beswick was to have the right to enforce
any term of the contract. But she would have a prima facie right of action under section
1(1)(b) unless the presumption was rebutted under section 1(2). At this point it would be
necessary to discover what was said by the parties in the solicitor’s office on the fateful
day in question and to explore the reasons for the failure of the solicitor to confer an
enforceable right of action upon Mrs Beswick. If he was acting on instructions not to
confer a right of action upon her then the presumption that she was intended to have a
right of enforcement would be rebutted. Of course, as Professor Treitel points out, we
will never know the reason for the failure to confer an enforceable right of action upon
Mrs Beswick but his careful examination of the facts of the case serves as a helpful
reminder of the point that we should not lightly assume that the intention of two
contracting parties is inevitably to confer a right of action on the third party.
Cases such as 
Jackson
 
v. 
Horizon Holidays Ltd
 
probably fall within the scope of section
1(1)(b) provided that the members of the holiday party are identified at the time of entry
into the contract. Thus Treitel states (
The Law of Contract
 
(14th edn, Sweet & Maxwell,
2015, edited by Edwin Peel), para 14–106):
If the person making the booking supplied the names of other members of the family when the contract was
made, those other members would probably acquire rights under subs 1(1); but no such rights are likely to be
acquired if a person simply rented a holiday cottage without giving any information as to the number or names
of the persons with whom he proposed to share the accommodation.
Professor Burrows also suggests that a third party, C, will not acquire a right to enforce a
term of the contract where the contract between A and B contains a term which
prohibits the assignment to C of B’s right to enforce the payment without A’s written
consent. But can one go even further and suggest that a clause that entitles B to assign
his rights to C operates to deny to C the right to enforce the term of the contract under
section 1 of the Act? In such a case C acquires rights as the assignee of B. What useful
purpose is served by conferring on C an additional right of action under the 1999 Act?
Might it not be the case that the intention of the parties in such a case was to confer
upon C one right of action, namely his rights as assignee of B and so negative the
intention to confer a right of action under the Act? Obviously much will depend upon
the facts of the individual case but there must at least be the possibility that a court
would reach such a conclusion.
25.3.6.1.5
 
Drawing the threads together
The general impression which can be gleaned from the case-law to date is that the courts
have on the whole adopted a broad interpretation of section 1, the consequence of which
may be to confer a right of action on a third party which in all probability was not
intended by the parties to the original contract (a possible example being the decision of
the Court of Appeal in 
Chudley
 
v. 
Clydesdale Bank plc (trading as Yorkshire Bank)
[2019] EWCA Civ 344, [2020] QB 284). As Professor Davies has remarked (2021) 137
LQR
 
101, 111–112:
The 1999 Act has been interpreted in a broad manner that favours third parties, so the choice of commercial
parties to exclude the operation of the Act in order to avoid unanticipated outcomes remains justified.
Ironically, the fact that the Act is excluded so frequently may drive the courts towards an expansive
interpretation of the legislation. In 
Chudley
, Longmore LJ emphasised that the parties could have excluded the
third party’s right to enforce the contract but did not do so. Where commercial parties do not make the most of
this option, courts might feel emboldened to interpret the Act broadly in favour of third parties.
In this sense section 1 may be said to give to contracting parties an incentive to make
their intention clear. They can do so either by conferring a right of action upon the third
party or by making it clear that the third party has no such right of action. The initial
reaction in commercial practice, particularly in the construction industry, was to insert
into contracts a clause the effect of which was to exclude the application of the 1999 Act.
This negative response to the Act is still to be found in standard form contracts in the
construction industry. The attitude within commercial practice more generally remains
cautious but the initial hostility is perhaps being replaced by a realization that the Act is
beneficial where the contracting parties do intend to create an enforceable right of
action in the third party. As this realization dawns, one might expect that greater use
will be made of the Act. But in those cases where the intention is not to confer a right of
action on the third party, the safest course remains to say so expressly and to exclude
the operation of the Act.
Four other points can be made in relation to section 1. First, the section makes no
mention of the doctrine of consideration but the effect of the statement that the third
party ‘may in his own right enforce a term of the contract’ is sufficient to make it clear
that the third party has a right to enforce the term notwithstanding the fact that he has
not provided any consideration.
Secondly, as Professor Burrows points out, the third party has the same remedies for
breach of the contractual term as if he had been a party to the contract. Neil Andrews
illustrates the point in the following way (‘Strangers to Justice No Longer: The Reversal
of the Privity Rule Under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999’ [2001] 
CLJ
353, 360):
Suppose A promises B that A will pay C £100,000, and C relies on this promise to the extent of £5,000. The
court must decide whether C is entitled on the facts to £5,000 (the amount of his reliance) or the sum of
£100,000, the latter award fully vindicating C’s expectation of performance by A … The Law Commission clearly
wished third parties to gain satisfaction of their ‘expectation interest’ and not to be fobbed off with protection of
their reliance loss. … It seems likely that the courts will give effect generally to the third party’s expectation
interest unless, in exceptional circumstances, this will lead to injustice. Here we can peer at the future only
through a glass, darkly.
How much do you think C should be entitled to recover in this hypothetical case?
Thirdly, section 1 refers to ‘contracts’ and it is therefore a matter of some doubt whether
or not the Act applies to a deed. The Act is silent on this point. This is unfortunate and is
in marked contrast with section 4 of the New Zealand Contracts (Privity) Act 1982 which
states that ‘where a promise contained in a deed or contract confers, or purports to
confer, a benefit on a person … ’. However, in 
Prudential Assurance Co Ltd
 
v. 
Ayres
[2007] EWHC 775 (Ch), [2007] 3 All ER 946, [27] there was no challenge to the
proposition that a supplemental deed was a contract for the purposes of the Act. The
lack of challenge on the point means that it cannot be taken to have been conclusively
resolved. But the fact that no one challenged the assumption does indicate that the point
was not thought to be seriously open for argument.

Finally, there is no requirement that the third party should have knowledge of its right
to enforce a term of the contract at the time at which the parties entered into the
contract which created the third party right. As Flaux LJ observed in 
Chudley
 
v.
Clydesdale Bank plc (trading as Yorkshire Bank)
 
[2019] EWCA Civ 344, [2020] QB
284, [80], a claim under the Act is not a reliance-based claim. It is a claim for breach of
contract and ‘it is not a requirement of the 1999 Act that a third party who is entitled to
the benefit of a contract was aware of the contract at the time it was made or at any
particular time thereafter’.
25.3.6.2
 
Section 2
Variation and rescission of contract
(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, where a third party has a right under section 1 to enforce a
term of the contract, the parties to the contract may not, by agreement, rescind the contract, or vary it in
such a way as to extinguish or alter his entitlement under that right, without his consent if—
the third party has communicated his assent to the term to the promisor,
the promisor is aware that the third party has relied on the term, or
the promisor can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that the third party would rely on the
term and the third party has in fact relied on it.
The assent referred to in subsection (1)(a)—
may be by words or conduct, and
if sent to the promisor by post or other means, shall not be regarded as communicated to the
promisor until received by him.
Subsection (1) is subject to any express term of the contract under which—
the parties to the contract may by agreement rescind or vary the contract without the consent of
the third party, or
the consent of the third party is required in circumstances specified in the contract instead of
those set out in subsection (1)(a) to (c).
Where the consent of a third party is required under subsection (1) or (3), the court or arbitral tribunal
may, on the application of the parties to the contract, dispense with his consent if satisfied—
that his consent cannot be obtained because his whereabouts cannot reasonably be ascertained,
or
that he is mentally incapable of giving his consent.
The court or arbitral tribunal may, on the application of the parties to a contract, dispense with any
consent that may be required under subsection (1)(c) if satisfied that it cannot reasonably be ascertained
whether or not the third party has in fact relied on the term.
If the court or arbitral tribunal dispenses with a third party’s consent, it may impose such conditions as
(7)
it thinks fit, including a condition requiring the payment of compensation to the third party.
The jurisdiction conferred on the court by subsections (4) to (6) is exercisable by both the High Court
and a county court.
Commentary
The aim of section 2 is to strike a balance between the rights of the third party and the
rights of the original contracting parties. It does so by limiting the right of the parties to
the contract to rescind or to vary the rights of the third party without the latter’s
consent. In this sense the right of the third party may trump the rights of the parties to
the initial contract. The point at which the contracting parties lose the right to rescind or
vary the terms of their contract is either when the third party communicates his assent
to the term to the promisor (section 2(1)(a)) or where he relies on that term and the
promisor is aware of that reliance or ought to have foreseen that reliance (section 2(1)
(b), (c)). From the perspective of the third party, the safest course of action is expressly
to communicate his assent to the promisor. More difficult is the case where the third
party alleges that he has relied on the term. As Andrews has pointed out ([2001] 
CLJ
353, 366) it ‘seems inevitable’ that sections 2(1)(b) and 2(1)(c) ‘will excite litigation’.
But it is important to note that it is open to the contracting parties to reserve to
themselves the right to rescind or vary their contract without obtaining the consent of
the third party provided that they reserve such a power to themselves in their contract
(section 2(3)). In this way the Act preserves the freedom of contract of the contracting
parties. They remain 
entitled to define for themselves the scope of the right which the
third party will acquire but, in the event of their failure to specify the scope of that right
in their contract, they may lose their right to rescind or vary their contract if the third
party satisfies the requirements of section 2(1).
What is the meaning of the word ‘rescind’ in section 2(1)? It clearly encompasses a case
where the two parties to the contract attempt consensually to terminate their contract.
But what happens in the case where the promisor wishes to set aside the contract
because of a repudiatory breach committed by the promisee? Can the promisor
terminate the contract notwithstanding the fact that the third party has satisfied the
requirements of section 2(1)? The word ‘rescind’ was inserted into the Bill by way of an
amendment made in the House of Lords (the word used in the Law Commission draft
Bill being ‘cancel’). Moving the amendment the Lord Chancellor stated that ‘we would
not want a contracting party to be prevented from accepting a repudiation because of
the interests of the third party’ (HL Deb, vol 601, col 1055, 27 May 1999). This being the
case, it would appear that the promisor can elect to terminate the contract in the event
that the promisee commits a repudiatory breach and that the effect of the termination
will be to deprive the third party of his right to enforce the term. This point is of
significance with regard to 
Tweddle
 
v. 
Atkinson
 
(
25.3.1
). In 
Beswick
 
v. 
Beswick
(
25.3.2.1
) Lord Denning pointed out that it would appear that the reason for the failure
of William Tweddle’s claim was that his father had not paid the promised £100. Would
this failure on his father’s part also prevent William Tweddle from bringing a claim
under the Act? It appears that it would. His claim would fail either because William Guy
made a conditional promise to pay William Tweddle (that is, he would pay provided that
John Tweddle also paid) and that condition was never fulfilled or because John
Tweddle’s failure to make the payment was a repudiatory breach of contract which
William Guy accepted, thereby terminating the contract and with it any third party right
previously enjoyed by William Tweddle. A similar result would appear to follow both in
the case where the promisor has a right to set aside the contract against the promisee on
a ground such as misrepresentation, undue influence, etc. and in the case where the
contract is brought to an end as a result of the application of the doctrine of frustration.
This result can be justified either on the ground that the contract has not been rescinded
‘by agreement’ within the meaning of section 2 or on the ground that section 3
(extracted later) entitles the promisor to invoke against the third party any defences that
he would have had to the claim had it been brought by the promisee.
Can the contracting parties confer on the third party a right which is irrevocable from
the moment of its creation? The Law Commission concluded that they could not. They
stated at paragraph 9.46 of their report:
We do not see the attraction, nor the justification, for holding the contracting parties to a contract which the
third party has neither relied upon nor accepted. In our view this would be an unreasonable fetter on the
contracting parties’ freedom of contract which could not be justified by reference to any injustice to another
party. In any event, this would cut across the standard contractual principle that the parties are free to vary any
term of the contract, even a ‘no-variation’ term. We therefore consider that any provision of a contract for the
benefit of a third party which purports to render that contract irrevocable should be as open to variation or
discharge as any other contractual term. Similarly if the parties have expressly laid down a crystallisation test
different from reliance or acceptance, they should be free to vary it prior to reliance or acceptance by the third
party.

Professor Burrows has since stated that this passage is ‘misleading’ ([2000] 
LMCLQ
540, 547 fn. 22) and he concludes that it must give way to the ‘broad wording’ of section
2(3)(b) which, in his view, entitles ‘the parties by an express term to make the contract
irrevocable’, that is to say they can give ‘the third party absolute security irrespective of
the third party’s reliance or communication of intent’. As Andrews has pointed out
([2001] 
CLJ
 
353, 362) it would be ‘unfortunate if the Law Commission’s view were to
prevail because this would create a trap for the third party. Faced by such an ostensibly
irrevocable term, C might wrongly suppose that his rights under A and B’s contract are
indefeasible even if he neither assents to the relevant term nor relies upon it.’ In the
absence of case-law, and given this conflict of opinion, the matter must be regarded as
one of some doubt. This being the case, parties who wish to confer on the third party a
right that is irrevocable from the moment of its creation would be better advised to
create a trust of the contractual right (on which see 
25.3.3.2
).
25.3.6.3
 
Section 3
Defences etc. available to promisor
(1) Subsections (2) to (5) apply where, in reliance on section 1, proceedings for the enforcement of a term
of a contract are brought by a third party.
The promisor shall have available to him by way of defence or set-off any matter that—
arises from or in connection with the contract and is relevant to the term, and
would have been available to him by way of defence or set-off if the proceedings had been
brought by the promisee.
The promisor shall also have available to him by way of defence or set-off any matter if—
an express term of the contract provides for it to be available to him in proceedings brought by
the third party, and
it would have been available to him by way of defence or set-off if the proceedings had been
brought by the promisee.
The promisor shall also have available to him—
by way of defence or set-off any matter, and
by way of counterclaim any matter not arising from the contract, that would have been available
to him by way of defence or set-off or, as the case may be, by way of counterclaim against the
third party if the third party had been a party to the contract.
Subsections (2) and (4) are subject to any express term of the contract as to the matters that are not to
be available to the promisor by way of defence, set-off or counterclaim.
Where in any proceedings brought against him a third party seeks in reliance on section 1 to enforce a
term of a contract (including, in particular, a term purporting to exclude or limit liability), he may not do
so if he could not have done so (whether by reason of any particular circumstances relating to him or
otherwise) had he been a party to the contract.
Commentary
The effect of this section is to protect the position of the promisor in so far as it entitles
the promisor to rely, in an action brought by the third party, on the defences that would
have been available to the promisor had he been sued on the contract by the promisee.
This provision further demonstrates the fact that the third party right of action cannot
be described 
as a right to enforce the promise of performance in that his right is subject
to such rights as the promisor has against the promisee.
However, the entitlement of the promisor to bring into account matters relevant
between himself and the promisee is limited by the terms of section 3(2). First, the
promisor is entitled to rely on a ‘defence or set-off’ but cannot bring into account a
counterclaim against the promisee. The reason for this is essentially to protect the
position of the third party. The effect of a defence or set-off may be to reduce the third
party’s claim to zero but it cannot leave the third party with a liability to the promisor.
However, had the promisor been entitled to rely on a counterclaim which he had against
the promisee, and the size of that counterclaim had exceeded the amount claimed by the
third party, the effect might have been to leave the third party liable to the promisor.
Secondly the matter must have arisen ‘from or in connection with the contract’ and be
‘relevant to the term’.
Section 3(4) takes into account the equities as between the third party and the promisor
in that the third party’s claim is subject to the defences, counterclaims (not arising from
the contract), and set-offs that would have been available to the promisor had the third
party been a party to the contract. This time the promisor is entitled to bring any
counterclaim against the third party into account: the reason for this is that, if the
promisor does have a counterclaim against the third party, the third party cannot be
made worse off by allowing the promisor to bring that counterclaim into account in the
proceedings.
Once again the contracting parties can contract out of this provision either by providing
4.
5.
(a)
(b)
that the promisor may not raise any defence or set-off that would have been available
against the promisee or by making the third party’s claim subject to all defences and set-
offs that the promisor would have had against the promisee whether or not they arose
from or in connection with the contract and were relevant to the term.
25.3.6.4
 
Section 4
Enforcement of contract by promisee
Section 1 does not affect any right of the promisee to enforce any term of the contract.
Commentary
The effect of this section is to preserve the rights of the promisee. It therefore follows
that the rights of the promisee (discussed at 
25.3.2
) are unaffected by the enactment of
the 1999 Act. This being the case, the promisor is now potentially exposed to liability
both to the promisee and the third party. Section 5 of the Act seeks to protect the
promisor against the possibility of double liability.
25.3.6.5
 
Section 5
Protection of promisor from double liability
Where under section 1 a term of a contract is enforceable by a third party, and the promisee has
recovered from the promisor a sum in respect of—
the third party’s loss in respect of the term, or
the expense to the promisee of making good to the third party the default of the promisor, then,
in any proceedings brought in reliance on that section by the third party, the court or arbitral
tribunal shall reduce any award to the third party to such extent as it thinks appropriate to take
account of the sum recovered by the promisee.

Commentary
Section 5 deals with the case where the third party brings an action against the promisor
after the promisee has brought an action against the promisor and has recovered from
the promisor a sum of money in respect of the third party’s loss. In such a case the court
or tribunal shall reduce any award to the third party to the extent that it thinks
appropriate taking account of the sum recovered by the promisee. The section does not
deal with the case where the promisee brings an action against the promisor after the
third party has sued the promisor and recovered damages in respect of its loss. In such a
case the promisee will not be entitled to recover damages in respect of the loss that has
already been made good and will be confined to a claim for its own loss (which is likely
to be nominal in most cases).
25.3.6.6
 
Section 6
Exceptions
(1) Section 1 confers no rights on a third party in the case of a contract on a bill of exchange, promissory
note or other negotiable instrument.
Section 1 confers no rights on a third party in the case of any contract binding on a company and its
members under section 33 of the Companies Act 2006 (effect of company’s constitution).
Section 1 confers no rights on a third party in the case of any incorporation document of a limited
liability partnership or any agreement (express or implied) between the members of a limited liability
partnership, or between a limited liability partnership and its members, that determines the mutual
rights and duties of the members and their rights and duties in relation to the limited liability
partnership.
Section 1 confers no right on a third party to enforce—
any term of a contract of employment against an employee,
any term of a worker’s contract against a worker (including a home worker), or
any term of a relevant contract against an agency worker.
In subsection (3)—
‘contract of employment’, ‘employee’, ‘worker’s contract’, and ‘worker’ have the meaning given by
section 54 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998,
‘home worker’ has the meaning given by section 35(2) of that Act,
‘agency worker’ has the same meaning as in section 34(1) of that Act, and

Section 1 confers no rights on a third party in the case of—
a contract for the carriage of goods by sea, or
a contract for the carriage of goods by rail or road, or for the carriage of cargo by air, which is
subject to the rules of the appropriate international transport convention, except that a third
party may in reliance on that section avail himself of an exclusion or limitation of liability in such
a contract.
In subsection (5) ‘contract for the carriage of goods by sea’ means a contract of carriage—
contained in or evidenced by a bill of lading, sea waybill or a corresponding electronic
transaction, or
under or for the purposes of which there is given an undertaking which is contained in a ship’s
delivery order or a corresponding electronic transaction.
For the purposes of subsection (6)—
‘bill of lading’, ‘sea waybill’ and ‘ship’s delivery order’ have the same meaning as in the Carriage of
Goods by Sea Act 1992, and
a corresponding electronic transaction is a transaction within section 1(5) of that Act which
corresponds to the issue, indorsement, delivery or transfer of a bill of lading, sea waybill or ship’s
delivery order.
In subsection (5) ‘the appropriate international transport convention’ means—
in relation to a contract for the carriage of goods by rail, the Convention which has the force of
law in the United Kingdom under regulation 3 of the Railways (Convention on International
Carriage by Rail) Regulations 2005,
in relation to a contract for the carriage of goods by road, the Convention which has the force of
law in the United Kingdom under section 1 of the Carriage of Goods by Road Act 1965, and
in relation to a contract for the carriage of cargo by air—
the Convention which has the force of law in the United Kingdom under section 1 of the
Carriage by Air Act 1961, or
the Convention which has the force of law under section 1 of the Carriage by Air
(Supplementary Provisions) Act 1962, or
either of the amended Conventions set out in Part B of Schedule 2 or 3 to the Carriage by
Air Acts (Application of Provisions) Order 1967.
Commentary
The aim of this section is to exclude certain types of contract from the scope of the Act.
In the case of subsections (1), (5), (6), (7), and (8) the aim was to avoid a clash with
existing legislative schemes which conferred rights of action upon third parties. In the
case of subsections (2)–(4) the aim was rather different, namely to ensure that the third
party did not have a right of action in the specified circumstances. Section 6(5) provides
7.—
(2)
(3)
(4)
that the Act applies to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea only if the relevant term
is an exclusion or limitation clause (section 1(6) is similarly confined to terms which
exclude or limit liability) and this may suggest that an exclusive jurisdiction clause does
not fall within the scope of the Act on the ground that the Privy Council in 
The Mahkutai
(
25.3.4
) concluded that an exclusive jurisdiction clause was not an exception clause or a
limitation clause because it was a clause which created mutual rights and obligations
between the parties.
25.3.6.7
 
Section 7
Supplementary provisions relating to third party
(1) Section 1 does not affect any right or remedy of a third party that exists or is available apart from this
Act.
Section 2(2) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (restriction on exclusion etc. of liability for
negligence) shall not apply where the negligence consists of the breach of an obligation arising
from a term of a contract and the person seeking to enforce it is a third party acting in reliance on
section 1.
In sections 5 and 8 of the Limitation Act 1980 the references to an action founded on a simple
contract and an action upon a specialty shall respectively include references to an action brought
in reliance on section 1 relating to a simple contract and an action brought in reliance on that
section relating to a specialty.
A third party shall not, by virtue of section 1(5) or 3(4) or (6), be treated as a party to the contract
for the purposes of any other Act (or any instrument made under any other Act).
Commentary
Section 7(1) preserves the existing exceptions to the doctrine of privity. In this sense the
Act does not reduce the complexity of the law. That said, the practical significance of
some of these exceptions is likely to reduce as use is made of the Act. Is it open to the
judiciary to develop further exceptions to the doctrine of privity? The Law Commission
concluded that it was. In their report they stated (at para 5.10):
We should emphasise that we do not wish our proposed legislation … to hamper the judicial development of
third party rights. Should the House of Lords decide that in a particular sphere our reform does not go far
enough and that, for example, a measure of imposed consumer protection is required or that employees (even
8.—
(a)
(b)
(2)
(a)
(b)
though not mentioned in the contract) should be able to rely on exclusion clauses that protect their employers
under a doctrine of vicarious immunity, we would not wish our proposed legislation to be construed as
hampering that development.
It therefore remains open to the judiciary (at least at the level of the Supreme Court) to
take the step mentioned by Lord Goff in 
The Mahkutai
 
(
25.3.4
) of recognizing a ‘fully-
fledged exception to the doctrine of privity of contract’, perhaps by following the lead of
the Supreme Court of Canada in 
London Drugs Ltd
 
v. 
Kuehne & Nagel International
Ltd
 
(
25.3.4
). The Act has reduced the practical need for the courts to take such a step
but the possibility cannot be ruled out.
Section 7(2) is a controversial provision. Its effect is to entitle a promisor to exclude his
liability to the third party for a breach of the promisor’s contractual duty of care without
fear of challenge under section 2(2) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (except where
the third party suffers personal injury or death in which case section 2(1) of the Unfair
Contract Terms Act 1977 continues to offer protection to the third party). The effect of
section 7(2) is therefore to put the third party in an inferior position in comparison with
the promisee in that the promisee can invoke section 2(2) of the Unfair Contract Terms
Act 1977 to challenge the validity of the promisor’s exclusion or limitation clause but the
third party cannot.
25.3.6.8
 
Section 8
Arbitration provisions
(1) Where—
a right under section 1 to enforce a term (‘the substantive term’) is subject to a term providing for
the submission of disputes to arbitration (‘the arbitration agreement’), and
the arbitration agreement is an agreement in writing for the purposes of Part I of the Arbitration
Act 1996, the third party shall be treated for the purposes of that Act as a party to the arbitration
agreement as regards disputes between himself and the promisor relating to the enforcement of
the substantive term by the third party.
Where—
a third party has a right under section 1 to enforce a term providing for one or more descriptions
of dispute between the third party and the promisor to be submitted to arbitration (‘the
arbitration agreement’),
the arbitration agreement is an agreement in writing for the purposes of Part I of the Arbitration
Act 1996, and
(c)
the third party does not fall to be treated under subsection (1) as a party to the arbitration
agreement, the third party shall, if he exercises the right,
be treated for the purposes of that Act as a party to the arbitration agreement in relation to the
matter with respect to which the right is exercised, and be treated as having been so immediately
before the exercise of the right.
Commentary
The Law Commission recommended (para 14.19 of their report) that ‘a third party shall
have no rights of enforceability under our proposed reform in respect of an arbitration
agreement or a jurisdiction agreement’. The Act did not give effect to this
recommendation, at least in so far as it relates to arbitration clauses. Section 8 has its
origins in an amendment made to the Bill at Report Stage in the House of Commons.
Arbitration clauses present a particular challenge for the 1999 Act because, as we have
noted, the Act is concerned with the acquisition of rights by third parties, not the
imposition of liabilities on them. Arbitration clauses straddle that divide in that they
carry burdens as well as confer benefits. The Law Commission foresaw some of the
problems which would follow from the inclusion of arbitration clauses within the Act
and so decided not to include them within its scope. A different view was, however,
taken by the Government and so section 8 was introduced into the Act. The limited case-
law which section 8 has generated has, in the words of Tomlinson LJ, demonstrated that
the fears of the Law Commission ‘were not unfounded’ (
Fortress Value Recovery Fund
LLC
 
v. 
Blue Skye Special Opportunities Fund
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 367, [2013] 1 WLR
3466, [1]).
Section 8 is divided into two subsections. Section 8(1) deals with the more common
situation and it provides that where a third party is given a right to enforce a substantive
term of a contract between two parties and that right is subject to a term requiring the
submission 
of any dispute arising under the term to arbitration, then the third party is
to be treated for these purposes as a party to the arbitration agreement and so must
resort to arbitration if he is to enforce his substantive right under the contract. In this
situation, in order to obtain the benefit of his third party right of action, he must submit
to the condition that he assert it in arbitral proceedings rather than litigation. Section
8(2) by comparison deals with the situation where a third party is given the right to
require that a particular dispute with a promisor be referred to arbitration.
The difference between the two subsections was explained by Toulson LJ in 
Fortress
Value Recovery Fund LLC
 
v. 
Blue Skye Special Opportunities Fund
 
[2013] EWCA Civ
367, [2013] 1 WLR 3466, [44] in the following terms: section 8(1) enables a promisor to
give a third party an enforceable substantive right subject to a procedural condition
(namely arbitration) on which the promisor may but need not insist, while section 8(2)
enables a promisor to give a third party a unilateral, enforceable procedural right (to
refer a dispute to arbitration) which the third party may but need not exercise.
Section 8 has been considered by the courts on two occasions. The first was by Colman J
in 
Nisshin Shipping Co Ltd
 
v. 
Cleaves & Co Ltd
 
[2003] EWHC 2602 (Comm), [2004] 1
Lloyd’s Rep 38 (
25.3.6.1
). One of the issues between the parties was whether or not the
enforcement by Cleaves of their rights was subject to the arbitration agreement in the
charterparties. Colman J held that the case fell within the scope of section 8(1) and that
Cleaves were entitled to and were in fact obliged to refer the disputes to arbitration and
that the arbitrators had jurisdiction to determine them. Thus the enforcement by
Cleaves of their substantive rights was held to be subject to the procedural condition
that the dispute be referred to arbitration.
The second case is the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Fortress Value Recovery Fund
LLC
 
v. 
Blue Skye Special Opportunities Fund
 
[2013] EWCA Civ 367, [2013] 1 WLR 3466
where, on rather complex facts, the central issue was whether third parties were entitled
to rely on an arbitration clause contained in a partnership deed for the purpose of
insisting that the claim brought against them by an assignee of a party to the
partnership deed be referred to arbitration rather than litigation. The Court of Appeal
held that the third parties were not entitled to insist that the dispute be referred to
arbitration. The third parties were not entitled to invoke section 8(2) because the
arbitration clause only applied to ‘the parties hereto’ and so did not extend to third
parties. This suggests that it will be no easy task for a third party to invoke section 8(2)
because it will require clear words to persuade a court that the parties to the contract
intended to include third parties within an arbitration clause. Nor were the third parties
entitled to invoke section 8(1). While certain provisions of the partnership deed did
extend to the third parties (such as the exclusion of liability and the right to certain
indemnities) this did not give them an entitlement to insist that all disputes between the
parties be referred to arbitration. Rather, the requirement to refer the dispute to
arbitration only applied to a dispute arising in connection with the substantive rights
which the third parties had acquired. The dispute in the present case was not one which

related to one of those substantive rights and accordingly the third parties did not have
the right to insist that the dispute be referred to arbitration. As Toulson LJ observed, the
‘fallacy’ in the third parties’ argument was that they had confused ‘the nature of a
procedural qualification of a substantive right’ (namely the requirement to refer a
dispute relating to the enforcement of a substantive right under the contract to
arbitration) with the grant of a ‘positive procedural right’ under section 8(2) (which the
third parties were held not to have).

Third Parties and the Imposition of
Liabilities
As a general rule parties to a contract cannot impose an obligation on a third party
without the latter’s consent. The existence of this general rule is widely accepted and
consequently this area of law has not witnessed the upheaval we have seen in the context
of the acquisition 
of rights by third parties. The general rule is subject to a number of
exceptions and it is important to note that neither the rule nor its exceptions are affected
by the 1999 Act (the Law Commission expressly stated in their report (para 2.1) that
their proposed reforms ‘do not … seek to change the “burden” aspect of the privity
doctrine or the exceptions to it’). Three exceptions to the rule require further comment.
The first is that the existence of a contract imposes an obligation upon third parties in
the sense that it is a tort to induce one party to a contract to break that contract. In this
respect it can be said that third parties must respect the sanctity of contracts to which
they are not a party. Take the case where A and B conclude a contract under which A
agrees to work for B for a period of two years. C wishes to procure the services of A
during that two-year period and so he offers to double A’s salary if A terminates his
contract with B. Does C commit a tort in seeking to persuade A to terminate his contract
with B? The answer depends on whether or not C persuaded A to terminate the contract
lawfully. If C offered A an increase in salary and A gave notice of termination in
accordance with the terms of the contract then C would incur no liability towards B. But
the position is different in the case where C persuades A to breach his contract with B. In
such a case C may be liable in tort to B. Authority for this proposition is to be found in
the case of 
Lumley
 
v. 
Gye
 
(1853) 2 El & Bl 216. The plaintiff and the defendant were
rival theatre owners. Miss Wagner, a famous opera singer, had entered into a contract
with the plaintiff under which she agreed to sing at his theatre for a period of time. The
defendant induced her to break her contract with the plaintiff by promising to pay her
more if she sang at his theatre. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant. He
succeeded on the ground that the defendant had committed a tort in inducing Miss
Wagner to break her contract with the plaintiff. The case has been a source of some
controversy on the ground that it can be argued that the plaintiff should have brought
his claim against Miss Wagner (who had, after all, broken her contract with the plaintiff)
and not against the defendant. According to this view, it should be for a contracting
party to decide whether or not to perform her obligations under the contract and she
must decide whether or not to resist the inducement to breach her contract. But this is
not the view that the courts have taken. Instead they have concluded that it is a tort
intentionally to induce one party to a contract to break it and thereby cause loss to the
other contracting party. It is also a tort to interfere with contractual rights by unlawful
means. The latter tort is, however, clearly distinguishable from the tort of inducing
breach of contract. It is a form of primary liability, whereas the tort of inducing breach
of contract is an example of accessory liability, being dependent upon the primary
wrongful act of the contracting party, namely the breach of contract (
OBG Ltd
 
v. 
Allan
[2007] UKHL 21, [2008] 1 AC 1).
A second exception is the doctrine of bailment on terms, to which reference has already
been made (see 
25.3.4
). The effect of this doctrine is to bind an owner of goods to the
terms of a sub-bailment provided that certain conditions are satisfied (see 
The Pioneer
Container
 
[1994] 2 AC 324 (discussed at 
25.3.4
) and 
Morris
 
v. 
C W Martin & Sons Ltd
[1966] 1 QB 716).
The third and most controversial exception is the extent to which a purchaser of land or
goods is affected by a contract relating to the land or the goods which was entered into
by the vendor prior to the sale of the land or goods to the purchaser. On what basis can
the purchaser be affected by a contract to which he was not a party? One view is that he
is affected because he has notice of the existence of the contract at the time of
acquisition of the land or goods. Authority to this effect can be found in the judgment of
Knight Bruce LJ in 
De Mattos
 
v. 
Gibson
 
(1858) 4 De G & J 276 when he stated (at p.
282):
Reason and justice seem to prescribe that, at least as a general rule, where a man, by gift or purchase,
acquires property from another, with knowledge of a previous contract, lawfully and for valuable consideration
made by him with a third person, to use and employ the property for a particular purpose in a specified manner,
the acquirer shall not, to the material damage of the third person, in opposition to the contract and
inconsistently with it, use and employ the property in a manner not allowable to the giver or seller. This rule,
applicable alike in general as I conceive to moveable and immoveable property, and recognised and adopted, as
I apprehend, by the English law, may, like other general rules, be liable to exceptions arising from special
circumstances; but I see at present no room for any exception in the instance before us.
This statement is open to challenge. The right of the third party is a personal right which
is exercisable against the vendor; it is not a property right which can be asserted and
enforced against third parties, such as the purchaser. And the fact that the purchaser has
notice of the third party’s contractual right against the vendor ought not to be able to
transform the third party’s personal right against the vendor into a property right
binding on the purchaser. Yet the authorities appear to say otherwise.
In relation to the acquisition of land there is long-standing authority to the effect that a
party who acquires property that is, to his knowledge, subject to a restrictive covenant is
bound by the terms of that covenant and may be restrained from acting inconsistently
with the terms of the covenant (
Tulk
 
v. 
Moxhay
 
(1848) 2 Ph 774). But this principle
operates within narrow limits. In particular, the person seeking to enforce the covenant
must show that the covenant was imposed for the benefit of neighbouring land owned
by him.
The position is more complex in relation to the acquisition of goods or chattels. Here we
encounter the statement of principle made by Knight-Bruce LJ in 
De Mattos
 
v. 
Gibson
(extracted earlier). This statement of principle has given rise to difficulty, particularly in
the cases of 
Lord Strathcona Steamship Co Ltd
 
v. 
Dominion Coal Co Ltd
 
[1926] AC 108
and 
Port Line Ltd
 
v. 
Ben Line Steamers Ltd
 
[1958] 2 QB 146. These cases were
summarized and then analysed by Browne-Wilkinson J in 
Swiss Bank Corporation
 
v.
Lloyd’s Bank Ltd
 
[1979] Ch 548, 572–575 in the following terms:
In 
De Mattos
 
v. 
Gibson
, 4 De G & J 276, the plaintiff had chartered a ship from its owner Curry. Curry had
subsequently charged the ship to Gibson, who had actual notice of the charterparty. Curry got into financial
difficulties and was unable to continue the voyage. Gibson was proposing to sell the ship of which he had taken
possession. In the action the plaintiff claimed an injunction against Gibson restraining him from interfering
with the charterparty. The plaintiff applied for an interim injunction which was granted, on appeal. The grounds
for the decision of Knight Bruce LJ were those set out at p. 282, in the passage I have already read. The decision
of Turner LJ at p. 284 was founded entirely on balance of convenience, but one of the three questions he said
would have to be decided at the trial was whether the plaintiff, even if not entitled to specific performance of the
charterparty, was entitled to an injunction to restrain a breach of the charterparty. In due course the action
came on for trial before Page Wood V-C from whose decision there was an appeal to Lord Chelmsford LC. The
Lord Chancellor held that no injunction should be granted against Gibson. He referred expressly to the three
questions posed by Turner LJ, at p. 294, and after holding that the charterparty could not be specifically
performed, said, at p. 299, that Gibson having taken with full knowledge of the charter could be restrained from
doing any act which would have the immediate effect of preventing its performance. But Lord Chelmsford LC
went on to show that on the 
facts there was no real possibility of Curry performing the charterparty whatever
Gibson did, and therefore there was no question of any act by Gibson constituting an interference by Gibson
with the plaintiff’s contractual rights. In my judgment that case is an authority binding on me that a person
taking a charge on property which he knows to be subject to a contractual obligation can be restrained from
exercising his rights under the charge in such a way as to interfere with the performance of that contractual
obligation: in my judgment the 
De Mattos
 
v. 
Gibson
 
principle is merely the equitable counterpart of the tort.
But two points have to be emphasised about the decision in 
De Mattos
 
v. 
Gibson
: first, the ship was acquired
with actual knowledge of the plaintiff’s contractual rights, secondly, that no such injunction will be granted
against the third party if it is clear that the original contracting party cannot in any event perform his contract.
It is this second point which in my judgment accounts for the fact that the 
De Mattos
 
v. 
Gibson
 
principle is not
applicable to restrictive covenants: the original contracting party—even if traceable—could not carry out his
contract relating to the land or the chattel once he had parted with it.
In 
Lord Strathcona Steamship Co Ltd
 
v. 
Dominion Coal Co Ltd
 
[1926] AC 108, the facts were that a ship
which was the subject matter of a charterparty to Dominion was sold to Strathcona expressly subject to the
rights of Dominion under the charterparty. The Privy Council held that an injunction could be granted
restraining Strathcona from interfering with Dominion’s rights under the charterparty. It will be noted that the
Strathcona
 
case is of the type I considered under category (b) above, i.e. Strathcona bought expressly subject to
Dominion’s rights, and certainly one ground of decision is that, in the circumstances, Strathcona was a
constructive trustee: see pp. 124–125. It is not clear to me whether this was the only ground of decision since
the passages in the judgment dealing with 
De Mattos
 
v. 
Gibson
, 4 De G & J 276—which was held to be good law
—certainly seem to proceed on the basis of knowing interference with another’s contract: see p. 119. The Privy
Council accepted that, in order to get an injunction the plaintiff had to have a continuing interest in the
property but undoubtedly held that a bare contractual right, as opposed to a property interest, was a sufficient
interest for this purpose.
There are parts of the judgment in the 
Strathcona
 
case [1926] AC 108 which I find difficult to follow but in
my judgment it certainly decides (a) that 
De Mattos
 
v. 
Gibson
, 4 De G & J 276, is good law and (b) that an
injunction can be granted to restrain a subsequent purchaser of a chattel from using it so as to cause a breach of
a contract of which he has express notice.
In 
Port Line Ltd
 
v. 
Ben Line Steamers Ltd
 
[1958] 2 QB 146 Diplock J—sitting as a judge of first instance—
stated that he thought the 
Strathcona
 
case [1926] AC 108 was wrongly decided and refused to follow it. In that
case Port had chartered a vessel from Silver. Silver then sold to Ben but subject to an immediate re-charter by
Ben to Silver. Under the charterparty between Port and Silver the requisitioning of the vessel did not determine
the charter: under the charterparty between Ben and Silver it did. The vessel was requisitioned and Port was
claiming from Ben compensation received by Ben for the requisition. It is important to notice that Port could
only succeed if it showed either that it had a positive right to possession of the vessel or that Ben was
accountable for the compensation as constructive trustee. Diplock J was not concerned with the question
whether Port was entitled to a negative injunction to restrain the tort.
It is not necessary for me to express any view as to whether the 
Strathcona
 
case was rightly decided so far as
it was a decision based on constructive trusteeship, which was all that Diplock J was concerned with: the
Strathcona
 
case itself decided that there was no right to specific performance of the charterparty. However,
although I of course differ from Diplock J with diffidence, in my judgment the 
Strathcona
 
case was rightly
decided on the basis that Dominion was entitled to an injunction against Strathcona to prevent Strathcona from
interfering with the contract between Dominion and the original charterer. Diplock J at p. 165, explained 
De
Mattos
 
v. 
Gibson
, 4 De G & J 276, on that ground, and at p. 168, gave 
as an alternative ground for his decision
that actual, as opposed to constructive, notice was necessary in such a case. To that extent his decision supports
my own view.
What then are the authorities which suggest that the 
De Mattos
 
v. 
Gibson
 
principle is not good law? In my
judgment apart from the 
Port Line
 
case [1958] 2 QB 146 they are all cases falling within category (a) above
[namely cases involving restrictive covenants affecting land and resale price maintenance conditions affecting
chattels]; that is to say not cases in which the plaintiff sought an injunction to restrain the defendant from
committing the tort but cases where the plaintiff was seeking to make the defendant positively perform a
contract to which he was not a party. In particular, it is in my judgment clear that the remarks of Scrutton LJ in
London County Council
 
v. 
Allen
 
[1914] 3 KB 642 and 
Barker
 
v. 
Stickney
 
[1919] 1 KB 121 are to be read in their
context as cases where the plaintiff was seeking to enforce performance of the contract against the defendant
who was not a party to the contract. So far as I can see, in neither of those cases was there any consideration of
the rights of the plaintiff to a negative injunction restraining the defendant from causing someone else to breach
the contract with the plaintiff.
Therefore, in my judgment the authorities establish the following propositions. (1) The principle stated by
Knight Bruce LJ in 
De Mattos
 
v. 
Gibson
, 4 De G & J 276, is good law and represents the counterpart in equity of
the tort of knowing interference with contractual rights. (2) A person proposing to deal with property in such a
way as to cause a breach of a contract affecting that property will be restrained by injunction from so doing if
when he acquired that property he had actual knowledge of that contract. (3) A plaintiff is entitled to such an
injunction even if he has no proprietary interest in the property: his right to have his contract performed is a
sufficient interest. (4) There is no case in which such an injunction has been granted against a defendant who
acquired the property with only constructive, as opposed to actual, notice of the contract. In my judgment
constructive notice is not sufficient, since actual knowledge of the contract is a requisite element in the tort.
Commentary
This line of cases has generated a considerable academic literature (see, for example, S
Gardner (1982) 98 
LQR
 
279, A Tettenborn [1982] 
CLJ
 
58, N Cohen-Grabelsky (1982) 45
MLR
 
241, and W Swadling in N Palmer and E McKendrick (eds), 
Interests in Goods
(2nd edn, LLP, 1998), ch. 20). The cases give rise to two principal difficulties. The first is
one of principle: what principle is it that demands that the purchaser should be affected
by a contract that had been concluded by the vendor with a third party? The second
relates to the scope of the doctrine. When will the purchaser be affected by the contract
and with what effect? It would appear that the principle can only be invoked where the
purchaser has actual knowledge of the existence of the contract at the time of
acquisition. Further, the only remedy to which the third party is entitled is an injunction
to restrain the purchaser from acting inconsistently with the terms of the contract
between the third party and the vendor. In particular, the third party is not entitled to a
specific performance order requiring the purchaser to give effect to the contract between
the vendor and the third party.

Conclusion
The importance of the 1999 Act should not be underestimated. It provides a relatively
simple mechanism by which contracting parties can confer upon a third party a right to
enforce a term of their contract. The dominant philosophy that underpins the 1999 Act
is one of 
freedom of contract and, this being the case, the success of the Act in practice
will depend upon contracting parties themselves. A review of the Act (Beale, ‘A Review
of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999’ in A Burrows and E Peel (eds),
Contract Formation and Parties
 
(Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 225, 250)
concluded that:
while it is perhaps too soon to claim that the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 has been an
outstanding success, in that as yet its use seems to be limited, I think we can say that it has certainly not been a
failure. Rather I regard is as useful but still underused.
The statement that the Act remains ‘underused’ perhaps reflects a hangover from the
fact that many commercial lawyers were initially hostile to the Act and systematically
excluded its operation. Today a more reflective attitude is apparent and lawyers seem
more willing to invoke the Act where it is appropriate to do so.
While the 1999 Act expressly preserves the exceptions to the doctrine of privity that pre-
dated the Act, it is likely that the significance of these exceptions will diminish over time.
Contracting parties who wish to confer a right of action upon a third party are probably
more likely to make use of the 1999 Act than to rely upon one of the common law or
other statutory exceptions to the doctrine of privity. In many ways the 1999 Act has
given contracting parties an incentive to make their intention clear in relation to the
creation of third party rights of action. Where they make that intention clear, whether in
favour of or against the existence of a third party right of action, the court must respect
and give effect to their choice.
More difficult is the case where the contracting parties do not make their intention clear.
In such a case a court must first decide whether or not the third party has acquired a
right to enforce a term of the contract under section 1(1)(b) of the 1999 Act. Where the
requirements of that subsection are satisfied the Act will determine the rights of the
third party. In the case where the requirements of section 1(1)(b) have not been satisfied,
the court must go on to consider whether the third party has acquired rights by virtue of
one of the common law exceptions to the doctrine of privity or one of the other statutory
exceptions to the doctrine. While the Act expressly preserves the existence of these
exceptions, and indeed preserves the ability of the judiciary to develop still further
exceptions to the doctrine of privity, the willingness of the judges to make use of these
exceptions in the light of the enactment of the 1999 Act remains to be tested. It is
possible that they will be more reluctant to make use of the common law exceptions to
the doctrine of privity on the basis that the parties could have made use of the 1999 Act
but have chosen, for one reason or another, not to do so. On the other hand, they are
directed by the Act itself to continue, where appropriate, to make use of these
exceptions. The precise role of these exceptions, following the Act, remains to be seen
but it is suggested that the fundamental point that has to be grasped is that the 1999 Act
is now the first port of call in any case concerned with third party rights of action and, in
many cases, it is also likely to be the last port of call.

Online Resources: Additional Chapters
As part of the accompanying 
online resources
, two additional chapters are available
to download: ‘
Incapacity
’ and ‘
Illegality
’. These chapters provide complete
coverage for students who wish to explore these areas of contract law. Short summaries
of the two chapters are provided below.
Incapacity
This chapter examines the law relating to contractual capacity. While the vast majority
of the population have full contractual capacity, children and people who suffer from
some mental incapacity have limited contractual capacity. Similarly, companies and
local authorities have limited contractual capacity. In those cases where an individual or
entity has limited contractual capacity, the chapter considers the reasons for restricting
contractual capacity, the extent of the contractual capacity that the individual or entity
enjoys, and the extent to which the contractual restrictions on capacity can be evaded by
resort to the law of unjust enrichment or the law of tort.
Illegality
This chapter examines the circumstances in which a contract may be held void on the
ground that it is tainted by illegality or on the ground that it is otherwise contrary to
public policy. The chapter examines the circumstances in which a contract will be held
to amount to an illegal contract and the impact which such illegality will have on the
rights and duties of the parties to the contract. A similar analysis is conducted in
relation to the role of public policy and its impact on the enforceability of the contract. A
difficult issue which has generated inconsistent case-law is the extent to which the law in
this area should consist of flexible rules which give to the courts discretion to achieve
justice on the facts of the case or whether the courts should apply strict rules of law, the
effect of which is to deprive the contract of effect.
