<p>Filing date</p>
<p>• Priority (international)
  • If A files a patent application for the first time in a Paris Convention member state with a formal patent application and then files another patent application for the same subject matter in another Paris Convention member state, the filing date of A’s later application is the date of his first formal filing in a Paris Convention member state, provided that it is within the specified period.</p>
<p>• Specified Period:
  • Inventions and Utility Models- 12 months
  • Design-6 months</p>
<p>Filing date</p>
<p>• Priority (domestic)
  • A files a patent application of an invention or utility model for the first time in China. Another patent application is filed within 12 months for the same subject matter. The first filing date is deemed to be the filing date of the second application, and the first application is deemed to be automatically withdrawn.</p>
<p>• Implications:
  • Make invention and utility model patent applications interchangeable
  • Consolidation of several applications
  • Re-apply after withdrawal</p>
<p>Prohibition of repeated grant of patent rights</p>
<p><strong>Article 9</strong> One patent shall be granted to one creation. …</p>
<p>Where two or more applicants file applications for a patent for an identical invention, the patent shall be granted to the applicant who is the first to file an application.</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid extension of protection period</li>
<li>Avoiding conflicts between rights holders</li>
</ul>
<p>Prohibition of repeated grant of patent rights</p>
<p>• <strong>Article 9</strong> One patent shall be granted to one creation. However, if a same applicant applied for both a patent for utility model and a patent for invention on a same day, if the patent for the utility model it has previously applied for has not terminated yet and if the applicant declares to waive the patent for utility model, the patent for invention can be granted.</p>

Patent examination

For different creations, China adopts different examination mechanisms.
Invention: Disclosure first, then substantive examination
Utility model and design: preliminary examination

<p>Invention patent application</p>
<p>• Preliminary examination (初步审查)
  • See if the application is filled out in accordance with the rules, whether the content of the request for protection is patentable subject matter
    • Rejection
    • If no reason for rejection
      • The full set of application documents will be made available to the public after 18 months from the date of application, which is called early disclosure, and the applicant can also request earlier disclosure (Art. 34)
      • Within three years from the filing date, the applicant may request the Patent Office to conduct a substantive examination (实质审查) of his or her invention patent application at any time. (Art. 35)
        • Rejection (Art. 38)
        • Granting patent (Art. 39)</p>

<p>Provisional Protection Period （临时保护时期）</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Article 13</strong> After the publication of an application for a patent for invention, the applicant may require the entity or individual exploiting the invention to pay an appropriate fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the applicant is not satisfied with the rejection decision, he can file a reexamination application with the patent reexamination office, that is, he thinks the patent office has made a mistake and asks for a reexamination. (Art. 41)</p>
<p>If the patent reexamination authority makes a decision of non-grant, the applicant can file an administrative lawsuit with the State Intellectual Property Office as the defendant to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court. (Art. 41)</p>
<p>Then if the Beijing IPR Court still finds that the decision made by the patent reexamination body is legal, so it should not be granted. At this time, the applicant can appeal to the Intellectual Property Court of the Supreme People’s Court. The decision by the court is final.</p>
<p>Disputes</p>
<p>• Granting patent
  • After a patent has been granted, if any person believes that the grant is wrong, he or she may request the patent reexamination body established by the State Intellectual Property Office to invalidate the patent right. (Art. 45)
  • Then the party concerned can file an administrative lawsuit with the Beijing Intellectual Property Court against the decision of the reexamination body to invalidate or maintain the validity of the patent. (Art. 46)
  • If a party is not satisfied with the decision, it can appeal to the Intellectual Property Tribunal of the Supreme People&#39;s Court.</p>
<p>Utility model and design patent application</p>
<p>• Preliminary examination (Art. 40)
  • See if the application is filled out in accordance with the rules, whether
    the content of the request for protection is patentable subject matter
    • Rejection
    • If no reason for rejection
      • Granting patent</p>
<p>• Dispute
  • If a utility model and design patent owner sues someone for infringement in a
    lawsuit, the defendant may also challenge the validity of the rights. Then in such
    a case, the right holder may request the Patent Office to issue an evaluation
    report of the patent rights. This is equivalent to requesting the patent office to
    conduct a supplementary substantive examination, the key is to conduct a
    search to see if the same technical solution and design existed before the
    application. If the evaluation report states that the same technical solution
    existed before, the plaintiff will not be able to win the infringement lawsuit.</p>
<p>The elements of patent right</p>
<p>• <strong>Article 11</strong> After the granting of patent for an invention or utility model, unless it is otherwise prescribed by this Law, no entity or individual is entitled to, without permission of the patentee, exploit the patent, that is, to make, use, promise the sale of, sell or import the patented product, or use the patented process and use, promise the sale of, sell or import the product directly obtained from the patented process, for production or business purposes （为生产经营目的）.</p>
<p>• After the granting of a patent for a design, no entity or individual shall, without permission of the patentee, exploit the patent, that is to say, they shall not make, promise to sell, sell, or import the product incorporating its or his patented design, for production and business purposes.</p>
<p>It usually refers to operations within a certain industry, whether for profit or not.</p>
<p>“for production or business purposes”</p>
<ul>
<li>P invented and patented a herbal feed additive for lactation-enhancing cattle.</li>
<li>D, an agricultural research institute, implemented P’s technical solution without permission and promoted the technical solution to numerous farmers.</li>
<li>P sued D for patent infringing the patent right. The defendant defended that its use did not for the purpose of production and operation.</li>
<li>Held: “The patent law will &quot;for the purpose of production and operation&quot; as one of the elements of patent infringement, for the purpose of reasonably balancing the interests of the patentee and the public. In the determination of patent infringement, the understanding of &quot;for the purpose of production and operation&quot; should focus on the specific infringing act being sued, and take into account whether the act belongs to the participation in market activities and whether it affects the market interests of the patentee, etc. The &quot;for the purpose of production and operation&quot; should not be simply equated with &quot;for the actual operation&quot;. It should not simply equate &quot;for the purpose of production and operation&quot; with &quot;actual profit&quot;; nor should it merely determine whether it has the purpose of production and operation according to the nature of the implementation subject. Even if a government agency or institution has the attributes of public service or public welfare and does not have the purpose of production and operation, but it has implemented market activities and harmed the market interests of the patentee, it can still be deemed to have the element of &quot;for the purpose of production and operation&quot;.&quot;</li>

<p>A plurality of spaced, substantially parallel disposed
blades or ribs interconnect two elongated sides of
the frame. The positioning of the blades or ribs is
such that when the banana slicer is laid to rest on a
substantially horizontal flat support surface (not
shown), the blades or ribs are disposed substantially
vertically. In accordance with the invention, the
blades or ribs must be sufficiently thin so as to be
able to serve as cutting tools capable of cutting
through a banana, without having a specially
sharpened wedge shaped cutting edge. On the
other hand, because the blades are preferably made
from plastic, they cannot be so thin or narrow that
their structural integrity would be compromised, or
so thin that they could not be manufactured by
suitable manufacturing processes, such as plastic
molding. For these reasons, the blades or ribs of the
preferred embodiment are approximately 1 mm
wide, although it should be understood that their
width can vary for as long as the foregoing
requirements are met. For example, when the blades
are made from high density polyethylene, their
thickness can be as little 0.9 to 0.8 mm, without
compromising their structural integrity.</p>
