 Question # 2 
 
The wearable health device market is expanding rapidly, yet accurate heart-rate monitoring 
during  physical  activity  remains  a  significant  challenge.  Many  current  devices  rely  on 
single-layer optical sensors that often produce errors when the device shifts  or moves—
errors that may lead to incorrect heart-rate readings. Inaccurate health data can harm users 
by  providing  misleading  information  for  fitness  or  medical  decisions  and  can  ultimately 
damage a company’s reputation in the market. 
 
In response, NovaTech—a startup based in Shenzhen—developed a new sensor system 
designed to overcome these deficiencies. Their technology uses a “multi-layer sensor array” 
together with an adaptive filtering algorithm, aiming to reduce motion errors and provide 
more reliable heart-rate information. This innovation is considered important because it 
offers  potential  benefits  in  both  consumer  fitness  devices  and  clinical  monitoring 
applications. 
NovaTech was founded in early 2020 by a team of engineers led by Ms. Alice Zhang. The 
company  set  out  to  solve  the  problem  of  motion  interference  in  optical  sensors  for 
heart-rate monitoring. In simple terms, NovaTech’s new technology uses several layers of 
light-emitting  diodes  (LEDs)  and  photodiode  detectors  arranged  one  behind  the  other. 
The  idea  is  that  if  one  layer  does  not  capture  the  correct  signal  because  of  movement, 
another layer may still do so correctly. An adaptive algorithm then processes these signals 
to extract a clear heart-rate reading. 
In June 2020, NovaTech filed two types of patent applications with the China National 
Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA): 
1. Invention Patent Application: 
This application explains the core sensor system. It covers a wristband that houses 
a sensor array, a multi-layer arrangement of optical components (with LEDs and 
photodiodes  in  a  stacked  format),  and  a  control  unit  that  runs  the  adaptive 
algorithm to filter noise. 
2. Utility Model Application: 
This application  was  filed  for  the  mechanical  design  of  the  sensor  housing. The 
utility model was granted quickly in early 2021. However, after the invention patent 
 Page  7  of  10 
 
was granted in late 2023, NovaTech decided to abandon the utility model to focus 
on one enforceable patent. The resulting invention patent, identified as 
CN2020-XYZ, will be valid until 2040. 
Excerpts from NovaTech’s Patent Documentation 
Patent Claims (CN2020-XYZ) Excerpts: 
Claim 1: 
A wearable heart-rate monitoring device, comprising: 
(a) a wristband housing to be worn on a user’s arm; 
(b) a sensor array on an inner surface of the housing, the sensor array including optical emitter elements 
(LEDs) and optical detector elements (photodiodes) arranged in a multi-layer format, where the first layer 
is made up of LEDs and the second layer is made up of photodiodes arranged so that the light from the 
LEDs falls on the photodiodes; and 
(c) a control module connected to the sensor array, which uses an adaptive filtering algorithm to process the 
detector signals and produce an accurate heart-rate reading during movement. 
Claim 2: 
The device of Claim 1, wherein the spacing between the layers is set at a predetermined distance to optimize 
the light diffusion and reduce interference between the sensor elements. 
Patent Specification (CN2020-XYZ) Excerpt: 
The  invention  relates  to  an  improved  wearable  heart-rate  monitoring  device  that  functions  well  during 
physical  activity.  Traditional  devices  using  a  single-layer  sensor  are  prone  to  motion  errors.  In  one 
embodiment, the device uses a two-layer sensor array. In this arrangement, the LEDs in the first layer and 
the photodiodes in the second layer are positioned so they overlap, allowing better capture of the light even 
when  the  wearer  moves.  The  adaptive  filtering algorithm  is designed  to  distinguish  the  correct  heart-rate 
signal from the noise generated by motion.1 
DragonBand Pro 
DragonTech Ltd. is a long-established electronics manufacturer based in Guangdong. In 
mid-2023,  DragonTech  launched  its  new  smartwatch  called  the  DragonBand  Pro.  This 
device  is  promoted  as  a  next-generation  wearable  that  features  a  heart-rate  sensor 
comparable to NovaTech’s innovation. Detailed public descriptions of DragonBand Pro 
state that it employs a sensor system consisting of a single layer of LEDs and photodiodes. 
 1  The specification includes diagrams of the sensor array layout and cross-sectional views of the wristband housing, as 
well as block diagrams of the control module. Test data included in the documentation shows a clear improvement in 
signal accuracy compared with one-layer designs.

Unlike NovaTech’s design, DragonBand Pro uses a light-diffusing film placed immediately 
adjacent to the photodiode array. This film is intended to scatter the light from the LEDs, 
thereby  helping  to  counteract  the  effects  of  motion.  The  display  and  overall  design  of 
DragonBand  Pro  are  modern  and  sleek,  with  a  focus  on  user  comfort  and  a  simplified 
internal sensor structure aimed  at reducing production costs. DragonTech’s product 
literature emphasizes that the use of the diffusing film is a novel approach to achieving 
similar performance improvements as the multi-layer system, while being more economical 
to  produce.  Technical  descriptions  available  in  public  product  manuals  explain  that  the 
diffusing  film  is  designed  to  capture  more  evenly  distributed  light  even  during  rapid 
movement, ensuring that the heart-rate measurement remains stable. 
Emergence of the Dispute 
In  early  2022,  NovaTech  and  DragonTech  engaged  in  private  discussions  under  a 
non-disclosure  agreement. NovaTech demonstrated its  sensor  system prototype to 
DragonTech, and both sides exchanged technical documents. However, while initial talks 
appeared promising, DragonTech later expressed concerns about the cost and complexity 
of  manufacturing  a  multi-layer  sensor  array.  With  no  formal  collaboration  reached, 
NovaTech  went  ahead  and  launched  its  fitness  band  featuring  the  patented  sensor 
technology. The product prominently displays patent number CN2020-XYZ and 
highlights the innovative multi-layer design. 
By  mid-2023,  DragonTech  introduced  the  DragonBand  Pro,  which,  based  on  public 
technical briefings and product manuals, seems to offer heart-rate monitoring capabilities 
similar to NovaTech’s device. Although its sensor system appears less complex—with only 
a single layer combined with a light-diffusing film—its performance during movement and 
the overall user experience are described as being very similar to those of NovaTech’s 
device. 
Furthermore, DragonTech has brought forward information suggesting that ideas similar 
to NovaTech’s invention had been described in earlier sources. They have pointed to:

1. A 2018 Academic Article: 
This  article  in  the  Journal  of  Biomedical  Optics  presents  a  wearable  sensor  that 
uses a dual-layer configuration to reduce motion-related measurement errors. The 
article  includes  simple  diagrams  and  data  that  show  improved  accuracy  with  a 
two-layer method. 
2. Earlier Utility Model Patents: 
Several  Chinese  utility  model  patents  from  2016  to  2017  describe  wearable 
heart-rate  sensors  that  use  multiple  optical  elements  arranged  around  a  central 
processing unit to boost performance. These patents outline sensor arrangements 
that appear similar in concept to NovaTech’s multi-layer design. 
3. Industry Publications: 
Industry white papers and technical reports from 2017 describe various methods 
to improve sensor performance, including replacing a physical second sensor layer 
with a light-diffusing film to achieve similar benefits at lower production costs. 
Documents  from  DragonTech  indicate  that  its  engineers  were  aware  of  these  earlier 
disclosures. A message from one DragonTech engineer in October 2022 mentioned that 
a dual-layer sensor could be realized either by stacking sensor elements or by applying a 
diffusing medium as a simpler alternative. 
The Dispute Unfolds 
In January 2024, NovaTech observed that DragonTech’s DragonBand Pro was widely 
available  in  stores  and  online.  Market  research  reports  noted  that  consumers  found  it 
difficult to differentiate between NovaTech’s fitness band and DragonTech’s DragonBand 
Pro. NovaTech’s technical team compiled a record of product images, internal test reports, 
and data from public sources showing that both devices achieve nearly identical heart-rate 
monitoring performance despite their structural differences. 
Soon after, DragonTech initiated administrative proceedings with CNIPA to request the 
invalidation of NovaTech’s patent CN2020-XYZ. In its petition, DragonTech argues that 
the ideas underlying NovaTech’s patent—specifically the use of a multi-layer sensor system 
with an adaptive filtering algorithm—are not sufficiently novel or inventive when viewed 
against  the  backdrop  of  the  academic  article,  earlier  utility  models,  and  industry  reports 
described  above.  DragonTech  also  asserts  that,  because  its  own  design  uses  a  diffusing 
film to achieve similar results, NovaTech’s claims are overly broad. 
At  the  same  time,  NovaTech  has  filed  a  complaint  asserting  that  DragonTech’s 
DragonBand Pro infringes its patent.
