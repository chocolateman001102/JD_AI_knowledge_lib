Frustration and Force Majeure
Central Issues
The doctrine of frustration operates to discharge a contract where,
after the formation of the contract, something occurs which renders
performance of the contract impossible, illegal, or something radically
different from that which was in the contemplation of the parties at the
time of entry into the contract.
While the doctrine of frustration is the subject of considerable analysis
in textbooks, its practical significance is limited. This is so for a
number of reasons. First, the doctrine does not apply where express
provision has been made in the contract for the event that is alleged to
have frustrated the contract. Given that force majeure and hardship
clauses seek to regulate events which may impede or hinder
performance of the contract, the impact of such events is more likely
to be regulated by the terms of the force majeure clause or the
hardship clause than by the doctrine of frustration. Secondly, the
doctrine does not apply where the event alleged to have frustrated the
contract was foreseeable. Thirdly, a contracting party cannot invoke
the doctrine of frustration where the alleged frustrating event was
caused by his own conduct rather than a supervening event. Fourthly,
the consequences of the application of the doctrine are drastic in that
it brings the contract automatically to an end, irrespective of the
wishes of the parties. The Draconian consequences of the application
of the doctrine inhibit its wider use. Finally, the courts have adopted a
restrictive approach to the operation of the doctrine in order to avoid it
becoming an escape route for a party who has entered into a bad
bargain. As Lord Roskill once put it, the doctrine of frustration is ‘not
lightly to be invoked to relieve contracting parties of the normal
consequences of imprudent bargains’ (
The Nema
 
[1982] AC 724, 752).
3.
This chapter has two principal aims. First, it seeks to ascertain the
scope of the doctrine of frustration and to examine the relationship
between the doctrine of frustration and any force majeure or hardship
clause that is to be found in the contract. Secondly, it explores, albeit
briefly, the reasons for the narrow scope of the doctrine of frustration
and contrasts it 
with the more liberal regimes to be found in, for
example, the Principles of European Contract Law. Should English law
follow the model found in the Principles and confer broader powers on
the courts, not only in relation to the circumstances in which they can
intervene but also in terms of their remedial powers when they do
intervene?

Introduction
In 
J Lauritzen AS
 
v. 
Wijsmuller BV
 
(
The
 
‘
Super Servant Two
’) [1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1
(
21.4
), Bingham LJ stated (at p. 8) that the doctrine of frustration has evolved to
‘mitigate the rigour of the common law’s insistence on literal performance of absolute
promises’ and that its object is ‘to give effect to the demands of justice, to achieve a just
and reasonable result, to do what is reasonable and fair, as an expedient to escape from
injustice where such would result from enforcement of a contract in its literal terms
after a significant change in circumstances’. There are three elements to this statement.
The first is the narrow approach initially taken by the common law. Liability for breach
of contract is generally strict; that is to say liability is not dependent upon proof of fault
by the party alleged to be in breach. This being the case, a party who fails to perform his
contractual obligations, for whatever reason, is prima facie in breach of contract. The
common law was generally reluctant to absolve a contracting party from the
consequences of his failure to perform his contractual obligations. The second point is
that the effect of the doctrine of frustration is to provide such an absolving power in that
it brings the contract to an end without imposing a liability in damages on the party who
has failed to perform his contractual obligations as a result of the supervening event.
The third point is that the doctrine only applies where there has been ‘a significant
change in circumstances’ after the making of the contract such that it would not be ‘fair’
to enforce the contract according to its original terms. As we shall see, the definition of a
‘significant change in circumstances’ has proved to be a difficult matter, but the essential
point to grasp at this stage is that the doctrine of frustration operates to discharge a
contract where, after the formation of the contract, something occurs which renders
performance of the contract impossible, illegal, or something radically different from
that which was in the contemplation of the parties at the time of entry into the contract.
The reference made by Bingham LJ to the ‘common law’s insistence on literal
performance of absolute promises’ is an important one. The original common law rule
was a very strict one. As Professor Simpson has pointed out (‘Innovation in Nineteenth
Century Contract Law’ (1975) 91 
LQR
 
247, 270):
In pre-nineteenth-century law the general rule was that a change of circumstances after a promise was made did
not excuse the promisor from performance, even if it made performance impossible; this view came to be
known as the rule in 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
 
(1647) or the rule as to absolute contracts. 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
 
did not
however deal with Acts of God, but with an Act of the King’s enemies, and there remained some scope for the
development of a defence of supervening impossibility through Act of God and this was allowed where death,
the most dramatic Act of God, intervened.
In 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
 
(1647) Aleyn 26 a tenant of a farm was dispossessed for a period of
two years as a result of an act of the King’s enemies. He claimed that he was not liable to
pay the rent for the period for which he had been dispossessed. It was held that he was
liable: he had assumed an obligation to pay the rent and he was bound to make that
obligation good. But, as Professor Simpson points out, the law did not take such an
absolute approach in all cases. An example is provided by the case of the death of a party
to a contract of apprenticeship. The courts held that the effect of the death of either
party was to dissolve the contract without any liability being imposed for the
consequences of a failure to perform the contract in accordance with its terms. Thus,
while the common law approach was very strict, it would not be true to say that it was, in
all cases, absolute.
The law has moved on from the strict approach taken in 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
. The decisive
case is generally considered to be the decision in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
(1863) 3 B & S 826
(extracted later). Its more liberal approach was developed in cases such as 
Jackson
 
v.
Union Marine Insurance Co Ltd
 
(1874) LR 10 CP 125 and 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
 
[1903] 2 KB
740 (
21.5.3
). While it is true to say that the doctrine of frustration is more liberal than
the common law rule to be found in 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
, it is important to stress that the
doctrine continues to operate within very narrow limits. Twentieth-century cases such
as 
Davis Contractors Ltd
 
v. 
Fareham Urban District Council
 
[1956] AC 696 (later in
this section), 
National Carriers Ltd
 
v. 
Panalpina (Northern) Ltd
 
[1981] AC 675 (
21.7
),
and 
J Lauritzen AS
 
v. 
Wijsmuller BV (The
 
‘
Super Servant Two
’) [1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1
(
21.4
) evince a restrictive approach to the scope of the doctrine of frustration. While it is
broader than the original common law rule, it remains a very narrow doctrine.
An introduction to the scope and the basis of the doctrine of frustration can be gleaned
from an examination of two cases. The first is the decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench
in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
(1863) 3 B & S 826 and the second is the decision of the House of
Lords in 
Davis Contractors Ltd
 
v. 
Fareham Urban District Council
 
[1956] AC 696.
Taylor
 
has been chosen because it is regarded as the origin of the modern doctrine of
frustration, while 
Davis
 
has been selected because it sets out the test that is generally
applied by the modern courts when deciding whether or not a contract has been
frustrated.
TAYLOR V. CALDWELL
(1863) 3 B & S 826, Queen’s Bench
The facts are set out in the judgment of Blackburn J.
Blackburn J
[gave the judgment of the court]
In this case the plaintiffs and defendants had, on the 27th May, 1861, entered
into a contract by which the defendants agreed to let the plaintiffs have the use of
The Surrey Gardens and Music Hall on four days then to come, viz. the 17th June,
15th July, 5th August and 19th August, for the purpose of giving a series of four
grand concerts, and day and night fetes at the Gardens and Hall on those days
respectively; and the plaintiffs agreed to take the Gardens and Hall on those days,
and pay 100l. for each day.
The parties inaccurately call this a ‘letting’, and the money to be paid a ‘rent’ but
the whole agreement is such as to shew that the defendants were to retain the
possession of the Hall and 
Gardens so that there was to be no demise of them,
and that the contract was merely to give the plaintiffs the use of them on those
days. Nothing however, in our opinion, depends on this. The agreement then
proceeds to set out various stipulations between the parties as to what each was
to supply for these concerts and entertainments, and as to the manner in which
they should be carried on. The effect of the whole is to shew that the existence of
the Music Hall in the Surrey Gardens in a state fit for a concert was essential for
the fulfilment of the contract,—such entertainments as the parties contemplated in
their agreement could not be given without it.
After the making of the agreement, and before the first day on which a concert
was to be given, the Hall was destroyed by fire. This destruction, we must take it
on the evidence, was without the fault of either party, and was so complete that in
consequence the concerts could not be given as intended. And the question we
have to decide is whether, under these circumstances, the loss which the plaintiffs
have sustained is to fall upon the defendants. The parties when framing their
agreement, evidently had not present to their minds the possibility of such a
disaster, and have made no express stipulation with reference to it, so that the
answer to the question must depend upon the general rules of law applicable to
such a contract.
There seems no doubt that where there is a positive contract to do a thing, not
in itself unlawful, the contractor must perform it or pay damages for not doing it,
although in consequence of unforeseen accidents, the performance of his contract
has become unexpectedly burthensome or even impossible. … But this rule is only
applicable when the contract is positive and absolute, and not subject to any
condition either express or implied: and there are authorities which, as we think,
establish the principle that where, from the nature of the contract, it appears that
the parties must from the beginning have known that it could not be fulfilled unless
when the time for the fulfilment of the contract arrived some particular specified
thing continued to exist, so that, when entering into the contract, they must have
contemplated such continuing existence as the foundation of what was to be done;
there, in the absence of any express or implied warranty that the thing shall exist,
the contract is not to be construed as a positive contract, but as subject to an
implied condition that the parties shall be excused in case, before breach,
performance becomes impossible from the perishing of the thing without default of
the contractor.
There seems little doubt that this implication tends to further the great object of
making the legal construction such as to fulfil the intention of those who entered
into the contract. For in the course of affairs men in making such contracts in
general would, if it were brought to their minds, say that there should be such a
condition.
Accordingly, in the Civil law, such an exception is implied in every obligation of
the class which they call 
obligatio de certo corpore
. … The examples are of
contracts respecting a slave, which was the common illustration of a certain
subject used by the Roman lawyers, just as we are apt to take a horse; and no
doubt the propriety, one might almost say necessity, of the implied condition is
more obvious when the contract relates to a living animal, whether man or brute,
than when it relates to some inanimate thing (such as in the present case a
theatre) the existence of which is not so obviously precarious as that of the live
animal, but the principle is adopted in the Civil law as applicable to every obligation
of which the subject is a certain thing. The general subject is treated by Pothier,
who in his 
Traité des Obligations
, partie 3, 
chap. 6
, art. 3, § 668 states the result to
be that the debtor corporis certi is freed from his obligation when the thing has
perished, neither by his act, nor his neglect, and before he is in default, unless by
some stipulation he has taken on himself the risk of the particular misfortune which
has occurred.
Although the Civil law is not of itself authority in an English Court, it affords
great assistance in investigating the principles on which the law is grounded. And it
seems to us that the common law authorities establish that in such a contract the
same condition of the continued existence of the thing is implied by English law.
There is a class of contracts in which a person binds himself to do something
which requires to be performed by him in person; and such promises, e.g.
promises to marry, or promises to serve for a certain time, are never in practice
qualified by an express exception of the death of the party; and therefore in such
cases the contract is in terms broken if the promisor dies before fulfilment. Yet it
was very early determined that, if the performance is personal, the executors are
not liable … It seems that in those cases the only ground on which the parties or
their executors, can be excused from the consequences of the breach of the
contract is, that from the nature of the contract there is an implied condition of the
continued existence of the life of the contractor. … These are instances where the
implied condition is of the life of a human being, but there are others in which the
same implication is made as to the continued existence of a thing. For example,
where a contract of sale is made amounting to a bargain and sale, transferring
presently the property in specific chattels, which are to be delivered by the vendor
at a future day; there, if the chattels, without the fault of the vendor, perish in the
interval, the purchaser must pay the price and the vendor is excused from
performing his contract to deliver, which has thus become impossible. … The
principle seems to us to be that, in contracts in which the performance depends on
the continued existence of a given person or thing, a condition is implied that the
impossibility of performance arising from the perishing of the person or thing shall
excuse the performance. In none of these cases is the promise in words other than
positive, nor is there any express stipulation that the destruction of the person or
thing shall excuse the performance; but that excuse is by law implied, because
from the nature of the contract it is apparent that the parties contracted on the
basis of the continued existence of the particular person or chattel. In the present
case, looking at the whole contract, we find that the parties contracted on the basis
of the continued existence of the Music Hall at the time when the concerts were to
be given; that being essential to their performance. We think, therefore, that the
Music Hall having ceased to exist, without fault of either party, both parties are
excused, the plaintiffs from taking the gardens and paying the money, the
defendants from performing their promise to give the use of the Hall and Gardens
and other things. Consequently the rule must be absolute to enter the verdict for
the defendants. Rule absolute.
Commentary
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
is a case of enormous significance in the development of this area of
the law. As Professor Treitel has stated (
Frustration and Force Majeure
 
(3rd edn, Sweet
& Maxwell, 2014), para 2–022):
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
is generally regarded as a turning point in this branch of the law, as the case in which the law
moved away from the doctrine of absolute contracts to the modern doctrine of discharge by supervening events.
This change was brought about by the familiar judicial technique of deducing a general principle from a series
of particular examples. In 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
, Blackburn J relies on three … mitigations of the doctrine of
absolute contracts …: cases in which death or permanent incapacity prevent performance of a contract for
personal services, cases in which specific goods are sold and perish after the property in them has passed to the
buyer, and cases in which the subject-matter of a bailment was destroyed without any default on the part of the
bailee. From these examples, he deduces the general principle which applies where ‘from the nature of the
contract, it appears that the parties must … have known that it could not be fulfilled unless … some particular
specified thing continued to exist’.
Taylor
 
is another example of an English court drawing upon civilian influences in the
development of the common law. The process of learning from other systems is no
modern phenomenon.
The general principle to be found in 
Taylor
 
is narrowly drawn. There are a number of
elements to it. First the Music Hall was ‘essential’ to the performance of the contract;
secondly, the Music Hall ‘ceased to exist’; thirdly, its destruction was not attributable to
the fault of either party; finally, the consequence of the destruction of the Music Hall
was to ‘excuse’ both parties from their obligation to perform. In confining the principle
to cases in which the subject matter of the contract ceased to exist, Blackburn J was able
to avoid a direct conflict with 
Paradine
 
v. 
Jane
 
(where the subject matter of the contract
had not ceased to exist). But this ground of distinction was not to last. While cases in
which the subject matter of the contract has ceased to exist may be at the core of the
doctrine of frustration, the doctrine extends beyond such cases to cases in which,
although the subject matter of the contract still exists, it is either not available for use
during the period of the contract or its use in the changed circumstances would be
something radically different from that which was in the contemplation of the parties at
the time of entry into the contract (
Jackson
 
v. 
Union Marine Insurance Co Ltd
 
(1874)
LR 10 CP 125).
The claim brought by the plaintiffs in 
Taylor
 
was one to recover the expenses which they
had incurred in advertising and making preparations for the concerts. Were the facts of
Taylor
 
to recur today the plaintiffs might attempt to recover these expenses from the
defendants under the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 (see 
21.6
) but the
claim would probably fail on the ground that the plaintiffs would not be able to establish
that the defendants had obtained a ‘valuable benefit’ as a result of their work in
advertising the concerts.
Finally, it is important to note that the technique used by the court was the implication
of a condition into the contract in order to give effect to what was claimed to be the
intention of the parties. As Professor Ibbetson has commented (
A Historical
Introduction to the Law of Obligations
 
(Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 224), the
nineteenth-century judges developed ‘rules of law behind a façade of party intention’.
He continues:
Thus in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
it was held that no action would lie for the breach of an agreement to allow the
plaintiffs the use of the defendants’ music hall when the music hall burned to the ground before the contract fell
due to be performed. The analysis of Blackburn J is revealing. Purporting to follow Roman texts to the effect
that there would be no liability on a 
stipulatio
 
to transfer property if it were accidentally destroyed before the
due date of transfer, he held that no liability arose in English law either, on the grounds that there was an
implied condition that the property should continue to exist; where Roman law had applied a rule, English law
construed—or imposed—an intention.
While implication of a term was the original technique used by the court to justify the
setting aside of the contract, modern courts no longer rely on this technique, as the next
case demonstrates:
DAVIS CONTRACTORS LTD V. FAREHAM URBAN
DISTRICT COUNCIL
[1956] AC 696, House of Lords
Davis Contractors Ltd was a firm of building contractors. They submitted a tender
to Fareham Urban District Council in relation to a building scheme at Gudgeheath
Lane, Fareham. Attached to the tender was a letter dated 18 March 1946 which
stated that the tender was 
subject to adequate supplies of labour being available
as and when required. The tender was successful and Davis and Fareham entered
into a contract in July 1946 under which Davis was to build seventy-eight houses
for Fareham within eight months for £94,425. Without fault on the part of Davis or
Fareham, adequate supplies of labour were not available and the work took
twenty-two months to complete at a cost to Davis of £115,233. Fareham paid Davis
the contract price. Davis claimed that they were entitled to be paid more than the
contract price. They advanced their claim on two separate grounds. First, they
submitted that the contract was subject to the conditions set out in their letter of 18
March so that the contract price was subject to the overriding condition that there
would be an adequate supply of labour. Secondly, they submitted that the delay
attributable to the shortage of labour had frustrated the contract. The House of
Lords rejected both submissions. It held that the letter of 18 March had not been
incorporated into the contract made in July 1946 and that the delay had not been
sufficient to frustrate the contract. The extracts that follow do not deal with the
incorporation point: they only deal with the doctrine of frustration.
Lord Reid
Frustration has often been said to depend on adding a term to the contract by
implication. … I find great difficulty in accepting this as the correct approach
because it seems to me hard to account for certain decisions of this House in this
way. … I may be allowed to note an example of the artificiality of the theory of an
implied term given by Lord Sands in 
James Scott & Sons Ltd
 
v. 
Del Sel
 
1922 SC
592, 597:
‘A tiger has escaped from a travelling menagerie. The milkgirl fails to deliver the
milk. Possibly the milkman may be exonerated from any breach of contract; but,
even so, it would seem hardly reasonable to base that exoneration on the ground
that “tiger days excepted” must be held as if written into the milk contract.’
I think that there is much force in Lord Wright’s criticism in 
Denny, Mott &
Dickson Ltd
 
v. 
James B Fraser & Co Ltd
 
[1944] AC 265, 275:
‘The parties did not anticipate fully and completely, if at all, or provide for what
actually happened. It is not possible, to my mind, to say that, if they had thought of
it, they would have said: “Well, if that happens, all is over between us.” On the
contrary, they would almost certainly on the one side or the other have sought to
introduce reservations or qualifications or compensations.’
It appears to me that frustration depends, at least in most cases, not on adding
any implied term, but on the true construction of the terms which are in the contract
read in light of the nature of the contract and of the relevant surrounding
circumstances when the contract was made.
Lord Radcliffe
Before I refer to the facts I must say briefly what I understand to be the legal
principle of frustration. It is not always expressed in the same way, but I think that
the points which are relevant to the decision of this case are really beyond dispute.
The theory of frustration belongs to the law of contract and it is represented by a
rule which the courts will apply in certain limited circumstances for the purpose of
deciding that contractual obligations, ex facie binding, are no longer enforceable
against the parties. The description of the circumstances that justify the application
of the rule and, consequently, the decision whether in a particular case those
circumstances exist are, I think, necessarily questions of law.
It has often been pointed out that the descriptions vary from one case of high
authority to another. Even as long ago as 1918 Lord Sumner was able to offer an
anthology of different tests directed to the factor of delay alone, and delay, though
itself a frequent cause of the principle of frustration being invoked, is only one
instance of the kind of circumstance to which the law attends (see 
Bank Line Ltd
 
v.
Arthur Capel & Co
 
[1919] AC 435, pp. 457, 460). A full current anthology would
need to be longer yet. But the variety of description is not of any importance so
long as it is recognized that each is only a description and that all are intended to
express the same general idea. I do not think that there has been a better
expression of that general idea than the one offered by Lord Loreburn in 
FA
Tamplin Steamship Co Ltd
 
v. 
Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co Ltd
 
[1916] 2
AC 397, at pp. 403, 404. It is shorter to quote than to try to paraphrase it:
‘ … a court can and ought to examine the contract and the circumstances in which it was made, not of
course to vary, but only to explain it, in order to see whether or not from the nature of it the parties must
have made their bargain on the footing that a particular thing or state of things would continue to exist.
And if they must have done so, then a term to that effect will be implied, though it be not expressed in
the contract … no court has an absolving power, but it can infer from the nature of the contract and the
surrounding circumstances that a condition which is not expressed was a foundation on which the
parties contracted.’
So expressed, the principle of frustration, the origin of which seems to lie in the
development of commercial law, is seen to be a branch of a wider principle which
forms part of the English law of contract as a whole. But, in my opinion, full weight
ought to be given to the requirement that the parties ‘must have made’ their
bargain on the particular footing. Frustration is not to be lightly invoked as the
dissolvent of a contract.
Lord Loreburn ascribes the dissolution to an implied term of the contract that
was actually made. This approach is in line with the tendency of English courts to
refer all the consequences of a contract to the will of those who made it. But there
is something of a logical difficulty in seeing how the parties could even impliedly
have provided for something which ex hypothesi they neither expected nor
foresaw; and the ascription of frustration to an implied term of the contract has
been criticized as obscuring the true action of the court which consists in applying
an objective rule of the law of contract to the contractual obligations that the parties
have imposed upon themselves. So long as each theory produces the same result
as the other, as normally it does, it matters little which theory is avowed (see 
British
Movietonews Ltd
 
v. 
London and District Cinemas Ltd
 
[1952] AC 166, 184 per
Viscount Simon). But it may still be of some importance to recall that, if the matter
is to be approached by way of implied term, the solution of any particular case is
not to be found by inquiring what the parties themselves would have agreed on
had they been, as they were not, forewarned. It is not merely that no one can
answer that hypothetical question: it is also that the decision must be given
‘irrespective of the individuals concerned, their temperaments and failings, their
interest and circumstances’ (
Hirji Mulji
 
v. 
Cheong Yue Steamship Co Ltd
 
[1926] AC
497, 510). The legal effect of frustration ‘does not depend on their intention or their
opinions, or even knowledge, as to the event’ (ibid at p. 509). On the contrary, it
seems that when the event occurs
‘the meaning of the contract must be taken to be, not what the parties did intend (for they had neither
thought nor intention regarding it), but that which the parties, as fair and reasonable men, would
presumably have agreed upon if, having such possibility in view, they had made express provision as to
their several rights and liabilities in the event of its occurrence’ (
Dahl
 
v. 
Nelson
 
(1881) 6 App Cas 38 at p.
59, per Lord Watson).
By this time it might seem that the parties themselves have become so far
disembodied spirits that their actual persons should be allowed to rest in peace. In
their place there rises the figure of the fair and reasonable man. And the
spokesman of the fair and reasonable man, who represents after all no more than
the anthropomorphic conception of justice, is and must be the court itself. So
perhaps it would be simpler to say at the outset that frustration occurs whenever
the law recognizes that without default of either party a contractual obligation has
become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which
performance is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which
was undertaken by the contract. 
Non haec in foedera veni
. It was not this that I
promised to do.
There is, however, no uncertainty as to the materials upon which the court must
proceed. ‘The data for decision are, on the one hand, the terms and construction of
the contract, read in the light of the then existing circumstances, and on the other
hand the events which have occurred’ (
Denny, Mott & Dickson Ltd
 
v. 
James B
Fraser & Co Ltd
 
[1944] AC 265, 274, 275 per Lord Wright). In the nature of things
there is often no room for any elaborate inquiry. The court must act upon a general
impression of what its rule requires. It is for that reason that special importance is
necessarily attached to the occurrence of any unexpected event that, as it were,
changes the face of things. But, even so, it is not hardship or inconvenience or
material loss itself which calls the principle of frustration into play. There must be
as well such a change in the significance of the obligation that the thing
undertaken would, if performed, be a different thing from that contracted for.
I am bound to say that, if this is the law, the appellants’ case seems to me a
long way from a case of frustration. Here is a building contract entered into by a
housing authority and a big firm of contractors in all the uncertainties of the post-
war world. Work was begun shortly before the formal contract was executed and
continued, with impediments and minor stoppages but without actual interruption,
until the 78 houses contracted for had all been built. After the work had been in
progress for a time the appellants raised the claim, which they repeated more than
once, that they ought to be paid a larger sum for their work than the contract
allowed; but the respondents refused to admit the claim and, so far as appears, no
conclusive action was taken by either side which would make the conduct of one
or the other a determining element in the case.
That is not in any obvious sense a frustrated contract …
Two things seem to me to prevent the application of the principle of frustration
to this case. One is that the cause of the delay was not any new state of things
which the parties could not reasonably be thought to have foreseen. On the
contrary, the possibility of enough labour and materials not being available was
before their eyes and could have been the subject of special contractual
stipulation. It was not made so. The other thing is that, though timely completion
was no doubt important to both sides, it is not right to treat the possibility of delay
as having the same significance for each. The owner draws up his conditions in
detail, specifies the time within which he requires completion, protects himself both
by a penalty clause for time exceeded and by calling for the deposit of a guarantee
bond and offers a certain measure of security to a contractor by his escalator
clause with regard to wages and prices. In the light of these conditions the
contractor makes his tender, and the tender must necessarily take into account the
margin of profit that he hopes to obtain upon his adventure and in that any
appropriate allowance for the obvious risks of delay. To my mind, it is useless to
pretend that the contractor is not at risk if delay does occur, even serious delay.
And I think it a misuse of legal terms to call in frustration to get him out of his
unfortunate predicament.

Commentary
Davis
 
is a case of alleged commercial impracticability rather than impossibility. It was
clearly not impossible for Davis to carry out their contractual obligations. Indeed, they
did carry them out and had been paid the contract price for so doing. Their submission
was, in essence, that it was not fair to hold them to the contract price in these changed
circumstances. Some jurisdictions in the world, such as the United States, recognize the
existence of a doctrine of commercial impracticability. 
Davis
 
can be interpreted as a
case that is hostile to the existence of such a doctrine. But this may be to go too far. As
Professor Treitel points out (
Frustration and Force Majeure
 
(3rd edn, Sweet & Maxwell,
2014), para 6–025):
The case may be indicative of the English attitude towards ‘impracticability’ but the outcome does not reveal
any actual difference between the English and the American approaches; for in an almost contemporaneous
similar American case the court reached the same result and did so for similar reasons. Moreover, the
percentage by which costs had increased in the 
Davis Contractors
 
case was relatively low: it amounted to less
than 23 per cent. of the contract price and such an increase would not have come even close to bringing the
American doctrine of discharge by impracticability into play.
Secondly, it is worth noting that the contractors in 
Davis
 
did attempt to make provision
for the consequences of a possible shortage of labour but failed to ensure that the term
was incorporated into the contract. This demonstrates the importance not only of
drafting an appropriate clause to deal with the impact of events which may make
performance more onerous or difficult but also of ensuring that that term is
incorporated into the contract (see further 
9.1
). The fact that labour shortages had been
in the contemplation of the parties at the time of entry into the contract also made it
more difficult for the contractors to argue that a shortage of labour frustrated the
contract (on the significance of foreseeability, see 
21.3
).
Thirdly, it should be noted that this was a contract which had been performed according
to its terms in that the contractors had done the work and the employers had paid the
contract price. The reason for the reliance by the contractors on the doctrine of
frustration was that it was necessary for them to set aside the original contract if they
were to succeed in their aim of recovering a sum in excess of the contract price. But their
attempt failed. Here one can see how frustration can be invoked by a party who wishes
to escape from what has turned out to be a bad bargain. The House of Lords were,
however, alert to this danger and they refused to invoke the doctrine of frustration for
the purpose of enabling the contractors to escape from their original bargain.
Two final points should be noted about 
Davis
 
and they can be taken together. The first is
that the judgments demonstrate a reluctance to invoke the doctrine of frustration. Thus
Lord Radcliffe stated that it was not mere hardship which caused the doctrine to be
applicable and that frustration was not lightly to be invoked as the dissolvent of a
contract. The second point is that the House of Lords rejected the implied term theory of
frustration which had found favour with the court in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
(earlier in this
section). It was, in the view of both Lord Reid and Lord Radcliffe, unrealistic to impute
the existence of the doctrine to the intention of the parties. Instead, the emphasis was
placed upon the construction of the contract and whether ‘the thing undertaken would,
if performed, be a different thing from that contracted for’. This obviously requires the
court to carry out a comparative exercise. The court must first ascertain what it is that
the contract requires of the parties and then it must compare the performance in the
changed circumstances with that originally 
undertaken. It is only in the case where there
is a radical difference between the original contractual obligation and performance in
the changed circumstances that the doctrine of frustration comes into play.
While the test set out by Lord Radcliffe may be described as the ‘overall test’ which the
English courts apply when deciding whether or not a contract has been frustrated, it
should not be thought that there is any one factor which the courts regard as ‘critical’ in
every case. The approach which the court adopts has been described as ‘multi-factorial’
(
Edwinton Commercial Corporation, Global Tradeways Ltd
 
v. 
Tsavliris Russ
(Worldwide Salvage & Towage) Ltd (The ‘Sea Angel’)
 
[2007] EWCA Civ 547, [2007] 2
Lloyd’s Rep 517, [111]). According to this view, regard should be had to a range of factors
when deciding whether or not a contract has been frustrated. Rix LJ summarized this
approach in his judgment in 
The Sea Angel
 
in the following way (at [111]):
Among the factors which have to be considered are the terms of the contract itself, its matrix or context, the
parties’ knowledge, expectations, assumptions and contemplations, in particular as to risk, as at the time of
contract, at any rate so far as these can be ascribed mutually and objectively, and then the nature of the
supervening event, and the parties’ reasonable and objectively ascertainable calculations as to the possibilities
of future performance in the new circumstances. Since the subject matter of the doctrine of frustration is
contract, and contracts are about the allocation of risk, and since the allocation and assumption of risk is not
simply a matter of express or implied provision but may also depend on less easily defined matters such as ‘the
contemplation of the parties’, the application of the doctrine can often be a difficult one. In such circumstances,
the test of ‘radically different’ is important: it tells us that the doctrine is not to be lightly invoked; that mere
incidence of expense or delay or onerousness is not sufficient; and that there has to be as it were a break in
identity between the contract as provided for and contemplated and its performance in the new circumstances.
In 
Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines
 
v. 
Steamship Mutual Underwriting
Association (Bermuda) Ltd
 
[2010] EWHC 2661 (Comm), [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 195, [105]
Beatson J divided these factors into two groups. The first, consisting of the terms of the
contract, its matrix or context, and the parties’ knowledge, expectations, assumptions,
and contemplations, in particular as to risk, as at the time of entry into the contract so
far as these can be ascribed mutually and objectively, he labelled ‘
ex ante
 
factors’. The
others (the nature of the supervening event and the parties’ reasonable and objectively
ascertainable calculations as to the possibility of future performance in the new
circumstances) he stated were ‘post-contractual’.
One consequence of the narrow approach to the doctrine of frustration is that it has
become a doctrine of limited practical significance. This is so for a number of reasons.
First, it does not apply where express provision has been made in the contract for the
event that is alleged to have frustrated the contract (see 
21.2
). Given that force majeure
and hardship clauses seek to regulate events which may impede or hinder performance
of the contract, the impact of such events is more likely to be regulated by the terms of
the force majeure clause or the hardship clause than by the doctrine of frustration.
Secondly, the doctrine does not apply where the event alleged to have frustrated the
contract was foreseeable (
21.3
). Thirdly, a contracting party cannot invoke the doctrine
of frustration where the alleged frustrating event was caused by his own conduct rather
than a supervening event (
21.4
). Fourthly, the courts have adopted a restrictive
approach to the operation of the doctrine in order to avoid it becoming an escape route
for a party who has entered into a bad bargain (
21.5
). As Lord Roskill once put it, the
doctrine of frustration is ‘not lightly to be invoked to 
relieve contracting parties of the
normal consequences of imprudent bargains’ (
The Nema
 
[1982] AC 724, 752). Finally,
the consequences of the application of the doctrine are drastic in that it brings the
contract automatically to an end, irrespective of the wishes of the parties (
21.6
). The
Draconian consequences of the application of the doctrine inhibit its wider use.
21.2
 
Construction of the Contract
The starting point in any case in which it is alleged that the contract has been frustrated
must be the terms of the contract itself. This is so for two reasons. The first is that it is
necessary to ascertain the extent of the obligations undertaken in the contract in order
to decide whether performance in the changed circumstances is something radically
different from the obligation initially assumed. In other words, one must ascertain the
obligations that have been assumed by the contracting parties before deciding whether
or not the contract has been frustrated. The second reason is a rather different one and
that is to ascertain whether or not the contract makes provision for the events which
have occurred. If the contract does make provision for that event then it is the contract
that will regulate the impact that the event will have on the obligations contained in the
contract and not the doctrine of frustration. Many modern contracts are drafted in
elaborate terms and the likelihood that the contract will make provision for the events
which have occurred is rather high. This is particularly so where the contract contains a
force majeure clause (see 
12.3.5
) or a hardship clause (see 
12.3.9
). In 
J Lauritzen AS
 
v.
Wijsmuller BV (The ‘Super Servant Two’)
 
[1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1 (
21.4
) one of the events
listed in the force majeure clause was ‘the closure of the Suez or Panama Canal’.
Suppose that performance of the contract became more onerous for one party as a result
of the closure of the Suez Canal. Such an event could not frustrate the contract because
the contract itself has made provision for the closure of the Suez Canal and, this being
the case, it is the contract that regulates the consequences of the closure of the Suez
Canal and not the doctrine of frustration.
Yet it is unlikely that the presence of a force majeure clause will suffice of itself to
exclude any possibility of reliance upon the doctrine of frustration (although in 
Bremer
Handelsgesellschaft mbH
 
v. 
Vanden Avenne-Izegem PVBA
 
[1977] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 133,
163 Mocatta J thought that there was ‘much to be said’ for the submission that ‘there
was no room for the doctrine of frustration to apply’ as a result of the elaborate force
majeure clauses to be found in the contract). While a force majeure clause (or a hardship
clause) does not suffice of itself to shut out the doctrine of frustration, the clause may be
relied upon for the purpose of showing that the parties have made express provision for
the event that has occurred. And, where the parties have made such provision, the
contract cannot be frustrated (except in the case of subsequent illegality, 
21.5.2
, where
overriding considerations of public policy prevent effect being given to the terms of the
contract: see 
Ertel Bieber and Co
 
v. 
Rio Tinto Co Ltd
 
[1918] AC 260). Why does the
presence of a force majeure clause not have the automatic effect of excluding the
operation of the doctrine of frustration? The answer is that a force majeure clause is
primarily intended to cover events which are capable of resolution within a relatively
short time-frame and a court is therefore likely to conclude that it does not, as a matter
of construction, extend to catastrophic events which render further performance
obviously impossible.
An example is provided by 
Metropolitan Water Board
 
v. 
Dick Kerr and Co
 
[1918] AC
119. Contractors agreed in 1914 to construct a reservoir to be completed within six years.
In 1916 the contractors were required by Government Order to stop the work and sell
their plant. 
In these circumstances the contractors claimed that the contract had been
frustrated. The Water Board denied that the contract had been frustrated and, for this
purpose, placed reliance on condition 32 of the contract which, after setting out the
obligations of the contractors, continued:
Provided always that if by reason of any additional works or enlargements of the works (which additions or
enlargements the engineer is hereby authorised to make), or for any other just cause arising with the Board or
with the engineer, or in consequence of any unusual inclemency of the weather, or general or local strikes, or
combination of workmen, or for want or deficiency of any orders, drawings or directions, or by reason of any
difficulties, impediments, obstructions, oppositions, doubts, disputes, or differences, whatsoever and
howsoever occasioned, the contractor shall, in the opinion of the engineer (whose decision shall be final), have
been unduly delayed or impeded in the completion of this contract, it shall be lawful for the engineer, if he shall
so think fit, to grant from time to time, and at any time or times by writing under his hand, such extension of
time either prospectively or retrospectively, and to assign such other day or days for or as for completion, as to
him may seem reasonable, without thereby prejudicing or in any manner affecting the validity of the contract,
or the adequacy of the contract price, or the adequacy of the sums or prices mentioned in the third schedule;
and any and every such extension of time shall be deemed to be in full compensation and satisfaction for, and in
respect of, any and every actual or probable loss or injury sustained or sustainable by the contractor in the
premises, and shall in like manner exonerate him from any claim or demand on the part of the Board, for and in
respect of the delay occasioned by the cause or causes in respect of which any and every such extension of time
shall have been granted, but no further or otherwise, nor for or in respect of any delay continued beyond the
time mentioned in such writing or writings respectively.
The Water Board pointed out that this condition applied to delay ‘whatsoever and
howsoever occasioned’ and they submitted that the events which had occurred were
regulated by condition 32 and not by the doctrine of frustration. The House of Lords
rejected this submission and held that the contract had been frustrated. Lord Finlay LC
stated (at pp. 125–126):
It is admitted that the prosecution of the works became illegal in consequence of the action of the Minister of
Munitions. It became illegal on February 21, 1916, and remains illegal at the present time. This is not a case of a
short and temporary stoppage, but of a prohibition in consequence of war, which has already been in force for
the greater part of two years, and will, according to all appearances, last as long as the war itself, as it was the
result of the necessity of preventing the diversion to civil purposes of labour and material required for purposes
immediately connected with the war. Condition 32 provides for cases in which the contractor has, in the opinion
of the engineer, been unduly delayed or impeded in the completion of his contract by any of the causes therein
enumerated or by any other causes, so that an extension of time was reasonable. Condition 32 does not cover
the case in which the interruption is of such a character and duration that it vitally and fundamentally changes
the conditions of the contract, and could not possibly have been in the contemplation of the parties to the
contract when it was made.
Thus the magnitude of the event was such that it took it outside the scope of the clause,
notwithstanding the use of the words ‘whatsoever and howsoever occasioned’. On the
same reasoning, a force majeure clause which includes in the list of force majeure events
‘strikes’ and ‘wars’ may be held, as a matter of interpretation, not to cover a protracted
national strike, 
such as a general strike, or a war of the magnitude of the First or Second
World War (see 
Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna
 
v. 
Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd
[1943] AC 32, 40–41). Such catastrophic events are, however, comparatively rare. Most
of the events that occur will fall within the scope of an appropriately drafted force
majeure or hardship clause. As contracts make provision for the occurrence of a greater
range of events, so the scope for the application of the doctrine of frustration
diminishes. In most cases the inquiry will start and finish with the terms of the contract
itself.
21.3
 
Foreseeable Events
A further factor which limits the operation of the doctrine of frustration is the general
rule that an event which was foreseeable, and therefore within the contemplation of the
parties at the time of entry into the contract, does not operate to frustrate a contract. A
frustrating event is one that was not foreseen and was not foreseeable by the parties. The
difficulty with this formula is the obvious one, namely identifying what is and what is
not foreseeable at the moment of entry into the contract. Events such as wars and
earthquakes are foreseeable in the sense that we are all aware that they may take place.
But in some parts of the world they are more foreseeable than in others. Take
earthquakes as an example: some parts of the world are at greater risk of earthquakes
than others. How foreseeable does the event have to be before it prevents reliance being
placed upon the doctrine of frustration? This is a difficult question to answer because it
is a question of degree and the Court of Appeal has warned against the ‘over-refinement’
of the concept of foreseeability in this context (
The ‘Sea Angel’
 
[2007] EWCA Civ 547,
[2007] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 517, [127]). The most that can be said is that the less that an event
in its type and impact is foreseeable, the more likely it is to be a factor which, depending
on the facts and circumstances of the case, may lead to the frustration of a contract. A
rather more robust view was, however, taken by Lord Denning in the following case:
OCEAN TRAMP TANKERS CORPORATION V. V/O
SOVFRACHT, THE EUGENIA
[1964] 2 QB 226, Court of Appeal
On 8 September 1956 the defendants chartered the vessel the 
Eugenia
 
for a ‘trip
out to India via the Black Sea’. At the time at which they entered into the
agreement both parties were aware of the possibility that the Suez Canal might be
closed as a result of the build-up of military activity in the area. The parties were
unable to reach agreement on a clause to deal with the possibility of the Canal
being closed and so the contract was silent on the point. A war clause in the
contract prohibited the charterers from sailing into a zone which was ‘dangerous as
the result of any actual or threatened act of war’ etc. The vessel arrived at Port
Said at a time when Egyptian anti-aircraft guns were firing and the zone was a
‘dangerous’ one within the meaning of the war clause. Notwithstanding this, the
vessel proceeded to enter the Suez Canal on 31 October 1956 where she became
trapped and was not released until January 1957. On 4 January 1957 the
charterers claimed that the charterparty had been frustrated by the events which
had occurred. The owners denied that the contract had been frustrated and
brought a claim for damages for breach of contract against the charterers. Their
claim succeeded. It was held that the defendants were in breach of the war clause
in entering the Suez Canal and that the effect of the closure of the Suez Canal had
not been to frustrate the contract between the parties.
Lord Denning MR
The second question is whether the charterparty was frustrated by what took
place. The arbitrator has held it was not. The judge has held that it was. Which is
right? One thing that is obvious is that the charterers cannot rely on the fact that
the 
Eugenia
 
was trapped in the canal; for that was their own fault. They were in
breach of the war clause in entering it. They cannot rely on a self-induced
frustration, see 
Maritime National Fish Ltd
 
v. 
Ocean Trawlers Ltd
 
[1935] AC 524.
But they seek to rely on the fact that the canal itself was blocked. They assert that
even if the 
Eugenia
 
had never gone into the canal, but had stayed outside (in
which case she would not have been in breach of the war clause), nevertheless
she would still have had to go round by the Cape. And that, they say, brings about
a frustration, for it makes the venture fundamentally different from what they
contracted for. The judge has accepted this view. He has held that on November
16, 1956, the charterparty was frustrated …
This means that once again we have had to consider the authorities on this
vexed topic of frustration. But I think the position is now reasonably clear. It is
simply this: if it should happen, in the course of carrying out a contract, that a
fundamentally different situation arises for which the parties made no provision—
so much so that it would not be just in the new situation to hold them bound to its
terms—then the contract is at an end. It was originally said that the doctrine of
frustration was based on an implied term; in short, that the parties, if they had
foreseen the new situation, would have said to one another: ‘If that happens, of
course, it is all over between us’. But the theory of an implied term has now been
discarded by everyone, or nearly everyone, for the simple reason that it does not
represent the truth. The parties would not have said: ‘It is all over between us’.
They would have differed about what was to happen. Each would have sought to
insert reservations or qualifications of one kind or another. Take this very case. The
parties realised that the canal might become impassable. They tried to agree on a
clause to provide for the contingency. But they failed to agree. So there is no room
for an implied term.
It has frequently been said that the doctrine of frustration only applies when the
new situation is ‘unforeseen’ or ‘unexpected’ or ‘uncontemplated’, as if that were an
essential feature. But it is not so. The only thing that is essential is that the parties
should have made no provision for it in their contract. The only relevance of it
being ‘unforeseen’ is this: If the parties did not foresee anything of the kind
happening, you can readily infer they have made no provision for it: whereas, if
they did foresee it, you would expect them to make provision for it. But cases have
occurred where the parties have foreseen the danger ahead, and yet made no
provision for it in the contract. Such was the case in the Spanish Civil War when a
ship was let on charter to the republican government. The purpose was to
evacuate refugees. The parties foresaw that she might be seized by the
nationalists. But they made no provision for it in their contract. Yet, when she was
seized, the contract was frustrated, see 
WJ Tatem Ltd
 
v. 
Gamboa
 
[1939] 1 KB 132.
So here the parties foresaw that the canal might become impassable: it was the
very thing they feared. But they made no provision for it. So there is room for the
doctrine to apply if it be a proper case for it.
We are thus left with the simple test that a situation must arise which renders
performance of the contract ‘a thing radically different from that which was
undertaken by the contract’, see 
Davis Contractors Ltd
 
v. 
Fareham Urban District
Council
 
[1956] AC 696, 729 by Lord Radcliffe. To see if the doctrine applies, you
have first to construe the contract and see whether the parties have themselves
provided for the situation that has arisen. If they have provided for it, the contract
must govern. There is no frustration. If they have not provided for it, then you have
to compare the new situation with the situation for which they did provide. Then
you must see how different it is. The fact that it has become more onerous or more
expensive for one party than he thought is not sufficient to bring about a frustration.
It must be more than merely more onerous or more expensive. It must be
positively unjust to hold the parties bound. It is often difficult to draw the line. But it
must be done. And it is for the courts to do it as a matter of law: see 
Tsakiroglou &
Co Ltd
 
v. 
Noblee Thorl GmbH
 
[1962] AC 93, 116, 119 by Lord Simonds and by
Lord Reid.
Applying these principles to this case, I have come to the conclusion that the
blockage of the canal did not bring about a ‘fundamentally different situation’ such
as to frustrate the venture. My reasons are these: (1) The venture was the whole
trip from delivery at Genoa, out to the Black Sea, there load cargo, thence to India,
unload cargo, and redelivery. The time for this vessel from Odessa to Vizagapatam
via the Suez Canal would be 26 days, and via the Cape, 56 days. But that is not
the right comparison. You have to take the whole venture from delivery at Genoa to
redelivery at Madras. We were told that the time for the whole venture via the Suez
Canal would be 108 days and via the Cape 138 days. The difference over the
whole voyage is not so radical as to produce a frustration. (2) The cargo was iron
and steel goods which would not be adversely affected by the longer voyage, and
there was no special reason for early arrival. The vessel and crew were at all times
fit and sufficient to proceed via the Cape. (3) The cargo was loaded on board at the
time of the blockage of the canal. If the contract was frustrated, it would mean, I
suppose, that the ship could throw up the charter and unload the cargo wherever
she was, without any breach of contract. (4) The voyage round the Cape made no
great difference except that it took a good deal longer and was more expensive for
the charterers than a voyage through the canal.

Commentary
The difficulty with this decision lies in Lord Denning’s rejection of the proposition that
the doctrine of frustration applies only to events which are ‘unforeseen’, ‘unexpected’, or
‘uncontemplated’. In his view, the test to be applied is whether or not provision has been
made for the event which has occurred, and the foreseeability of the event is merely a
factor to be taken into account when deciding whether or not one would expect parties
to make provision for the event which has occurred. Professor Treitel (
Frustration and
Force Majeure
 
(3rd edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2014), para 13–014) has criticized this aspect
of Lord Denning’s judgment on the following ground:
[T]hese remarks are 
obiter
 
and it is respectfully submitted that this aspect of the decision can be explained on
other grounds. At the time of contracting, the risk of the Canal’s being closed for a 
very considerable time
 
was
not foreseen; nor was it foreseeable on the high standard of foreseeability required to exclude frustration. To the
extent that the parties did foresee the risk, they seem to have allocated it by the terms of the charterparty. This
took the form of a ‘time charter trip’, which provided that the voyage was to be paid for by the time it took, and
so indicated an intention to throw the risk of delay on the charterers. There seems to be no reason why the court
should, by applying the doctrine of frustration to foreseen events, reverse such an allocation of risks deliberately
made by the contracting parties. [Emphasis in the original.]
The result in 
The Eugenia
 
seems to be correct but the reasoning is suspect. There is
authority to support the proposition that a contract is not frustrated when the event
which has occurred is a foreseeable one (see, for example, 
Walton Harvey Ltd
 
v. 
Walker
& Homfrays Ltd
 
[1931] 1 Ch 274). Much is likely to turn on the meaning of
‘foreseeability’ in this context. Professor Treitel has suggested that foreseeability is
relevant to the question whether or not a party has assumed the risk of the occurrence of
the event in question (see to similar effect 
The ‘Sea Angel’
 
[2007] EWCA Civ 547, [2007]
2 Lloyd’s Rep 517, [127]–[128]). Thus he states (
Frustration and Force Majeure
 
(3rd
edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2014), para 13–012) that:
‘Foreseeability’ will support the inference of risk-assumption only where the supervening event is one which any
person of ordinary intelligence would regard as likely to occur, or … the contingency must be ‘one which the
parties could reasonably be thought to have foreseen as a real possibility’. The distinction is between cases in
which parties can reasonably be expected to foresee the occurrence of the event as no more than a possibility,
and those in which they can be so expected to foresee it as a real likelihood. The inference of risk assumption
will be drawn only in cases of the latter kind; and even then it may be displaced by [other factors].
A second point worth noting about 
The Eugenia
 
is the conclusion that the closure of the
Suez Canal did not result in the frustration of the contract between the parties. Those
responsible for the drafting of force majeure clauses have taken notice of this fact and it
is now common practice to include the closure of the Suez Canal in the list of events that
trigger the operation of a force majeure clause.
21.4
 
Self-Induced Frustration
The doctrine of self-induced frustration has been described in H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on
Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021, para 26–091, footnotes omitted) in the
following terms:
‘The essence of frustration is that it should not be due to the act or election of the party seeking to rely on it’.
Thus, a contracting party cannot rely on ‘self-induced frustration, that is, on frustration due to his own conduct
or to the conduct of those for whom he is responsible’. Although the concept of self-induced frustration is
clearly established as a matter of general principle, the precise limits of the doctrine have not been clearly
established. It is merely a ‘label’ which has been used to describe ‘those situations where one party has been
held by the Courts not to be entitled to treat himself as discharged from his contractual obligations’. Thus
frustration has been held to be ‘self-induced’ where the alleged frustrating event was caused by a breach or
anticipatory breach of contract by the party claiming that the contract has been frustrated, where an act of the
party claiming that the contract has been frustrated broke the chain of causation between the alleged frustrating
event and the event which made performance of the contract impossible, and where the alleged frustrating
event was not a supervening event or ‘something altogether outside the control of the parties’. A party who has
been at fault or whose act was deliberate will generally be unable to invoke frustration because of the difficulty
which such a party will inevitably face in showing the existence of a supervening event which is outside his
control.
The leading modern case on self-induced frustration is the decision of the Court of
Appeal in 
J Lauritzen AS
 
v. 
Wijsmuller BV (The ‘Super Servant Two’)
 
[1990] 1 Lloyd’s
Rep 1. The case is an important one for three reasons. First, it demonstrates the width of
the doctrine 
of self-induced frustration; secondly, the judgment of Bingham LJ contains
a modern definition of the doctrine of frustration; and thirdly, it demonstrates the
crucial role played by force majeure clauses in commercial contracts today.
J LAURITZEN AS V. WIJSMULLER BV (THE ‘SUPER
SERVANT TWO’)
[1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1, Court of Appeal
The defendants, Wijsmuller, agreed to carry the plaintiffs’ drilling rig, named the
Dan King
, from Japan to Rotterdam. The contract, dated 7 July 1980, provided that
the rig would be delivered between 20 June and 20 August 1981 and that it would

Super Servant One
 
or

at Wijsmuller’s
option. Both of these vessels were large, self-propelled, semi-submersible barges
built for carrying large loads such as the rig. Clause 17 of the contract (which is set
out in full in the judgment of Bingham LJ) gave Wijsmuller the right to cancel the
contract in the event of force majeure or any other circumstance which reasonably
prevented the performance of the contract. The defendants claimed that by
November 1980 they had made an internal decision, which they admitted was not
irrevocable, to schedule

to transport the plaintiffs’ rig and to
allocate 
Super Servant One
 
to the performance of other concluded contracts. On
29 January 1981 
Super Servant Two
 
sank while transporting another rig. On 16
February 1981 Wijsmuller told Lauritzen that it could not carry the rig using either
Super Servant One
 
or 
Super Servant Two
. It could not use 
Super Servant One
because it was required for the performance of other contracts and it could not use
Super Servant Two
 
because it had sunk. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants’
failure to transport the rig in the agreed manner was a breach of contract so that
the defendants were liable for the additional costs that had been incurred in
transporting the rig by another method. The defendants pleaded that the contract
had been frustrated and they also relied on clause 17 as a defence to the claim
brought by the plaintiffs.
Four issues were ordered to be tried, namely:
whether the defendants were entitled to cancel the contract under clause
17
If the loss of the 
Super Servant Two
 
occurred without the negligence
of the Defendants, their servants or agents.
If the loss of the 
Super Servant Two
 
was caused by the negligence
of the Defendants, their servants or agents.
whether the contract was frustrated
If the loss of the 
Super Servant Two
 
occurred without the negligence
of the Defendants, their servants or agents.
If the loss of the 
Super Servant Two
 
was caused by the negligence
of the Defendants, their servants or agents.
Mr Justice Hobhouse answered ‘yes’ to question 1(a) and ‘no’ to questions 1(b),
2(a), and 2(b). The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal against the
conclusion of Hobhouse J in relation to questions 1(b), 2(a), and 2(b). The Court of
Appeal dismissed the appeal. Consequently the defendants were unable to invoke
the doctrine of frustration and were only able to rely on clause 17 if the loss of
Super Servant Two
 
occurred without the negligence of the defendants.
Bingham LJ
The contract of carriage was expressly governed by English law and not many of
its terms are germane to these preliminary issues. …
Clause 17 was the subject of two issues argued before the Judge, one of which
remains in contention on appeal. I should recite its … terms:
17.
 
Cancellation
17.1. Wijsmuller has the right to cancel its performance under this Contract
whether the loading has been completed or not, in the event of force majeur (sic),
Acts of God, perils or danger and accidents of the sea, acts of war, warlike-
operations, acts of public enemies, restraint of princes, rulers or people or seizure
under legal process, quarantine restrictions, civil commotions, blockade, strikes,
lockout, closure of the Suez or Panama Canal, congestion of harbours or any other
circumstances whatsoever, causing extra-ordinary periods of delay and similar
events and/or circumstances, abnormal increases in prices and wages, scarcity of
fuel and similar events, which reasonably may impede, prevent or delay the
performance of this contract.
[He set out the facts of the case and the four issues ordered to be tried and
continued]
Question 1(b)
The learned Judge answered question 1(a) in favour of Wijsmuller because he
rejected Lauritzen’s argument that cl. 17 did not apply before arrival of the carrying
vessel at the loading site. It was not disputed that the loss of 
Super Servant Two
was capable of being a circumstance which might reasonably impede or delay the
performance of the contract within the meaning of cl. 17. The question for decision
is whether, on a proper construction of cl. 17 read in the context of the contract as
a whole and of relevant background circumstances, Wijsmuller were entitled to
cancel the contract under cl. 17 if the loss of 
Super Servant Two
 
was caused by
1.
their (or their servants’ or agents’) negligence before the time for performance had
arrived. It was common ground that the Court’s task is to elicit the parties’
intentions from the contract they made according to familiar principles of
construction …
[He concluded that the expression ‘perils or dangers and accidents of the sea’
could not be read alone but had to be read as part of the contract as a whole. He
stated that, although clause 17 did not attempt to exclude liability for negligence, it
conferred upon the defendants a ‘right exercisable in a very wide range of
circumstances to nullify the contractual bargain made between the parties at no
cost to [the defendants] and regardless of the loss’ to the plaintiffs. Therefore he
concluded that the ‘broad approach’ adopted by the Privy Council in 
Canada
Steamship
 
v. 
The King
 
[1952] AC 192 was applicable to the construction of clause
17. Applying the three rules of construction derived from 
Canada Steamship
 
[on
which see 
13.2.1
] Bingham LJ held that clause 17.1 did not expressly cover
negligence on the part of the defendants. At the second stage he held that clause
17 was wide enough on its ordinary construction to cover negligence on the part of
the defendants. But at the third stage he held that clause 17 was not ‘deprived of a
sensible application’ if it was confined to events which were not brought about by
the negligence of the defendants, their employees, or agents. Almost all of the
events listed in clause 17 were events which were beyond the direct or indirect
control of the defendants. This being the case, clause 17 did not provide the
defendants with protection in the event that 
Super Servant Two
 
sank as a result of
the negligence of the defendants.]
Question 2: general
The argument in this case raises important issues on the English law of frustration.
Before turning to the specific questions I think it helpful to summarize the
established law so far as relevant to this case. …
Certain propositions, established by the highest authority, are not open to
question:
The doctrine of frustration was evolved to mitigate the rigour of the common
law’s insistence on literal performance of absolute promises … The object
of the doctrine was to give effect to the demands of justice, to achieve a just
and reasonable result, to do what is reasonable and fair, as an expedient to
2.
3.
4.
5.
escape from injustice where such would result from enforcement of a
contract in its literal terms after a significant change in circumstances …
Since the effect of frustration is to kill the contract and discharge the parties
from further liability under it, the doctrine is not to be lightly invoked, must
be kept within very narrow limits and ought not to be extended …
Frustration brings the contract to an end forthwith, without more and
automatically …
The essence of frustration is that it should not be due to the act or election
of the party seeking to rely on it … A frustrating event must be some outside
event or extraneous change of situation.
A frustrating event must take place without blame or fault on the side of the
party seeking to rely on it.
Question 2(a)
The doctrine of frustration depends on a comparison between circumstances as
they are or are assumed to be when a contract is made and circumstances as they
are when a contract is, or would be, due to be performed. It is trite law that
disappointed expectations do not of themselves give rise to frustrated contracts. To
frustrate, an event must significantly change—
‘ … the nature (not merely the expense or onerousness) of the outstanding contractual rights and/or
obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of [the contract’s]
execution … [
National Carriers Ltd
 
sup., at p. 700, per Lord Simon of Glaisdale].
Had the 
Dan King
 
contract provided for carriage by 
Super Servant Two
 
with no
alternative, and that vessel had been lost before the time for performance, then
assuming no negligence by Wijsmuller (as for purposes of this question we must), I
feel sure the contract would have been frustrated. The doctrine must avail a party
who contracts to perform a contract of carriage with a vessel which, through no
fault of his, no longer exists. But that is not this case. The 
Dan King
 
contract did
provide an alternative. When that contract was made one of the contracts
eventually performed by 
Super Servant One
 
during the period of contractual
carriage of 
Dan King
 
had been made, the other had not, at any rate finally.
Wijsmuller have not alleged that when the 
Dan King
 
contract was made either
vessel was earmarked for its performance. That, no doubt, is why an option was
contracted for. Had it been foreseen when the 
Dan King
 
contract was made that
Super Servant Two
 
would be unavailable for performance, whether because she
had been deliberately sold or accidentally sunk, Lauritzen at least would have
thought it no matter since the carriage could be performed with the other. I
accordingly accept [the] submission [of counsel for the plaintiffs] that the present
case does not fall within the very limited class of cases in which the law will relieve
one party from an absolute promise he has chosen to make.
But I also accept [counsel for the plaintiffs’] submission that Wijsmuller’s
argument is subject to other fatal flaws. If, as was argued, the contract was
frustrated when Wijsmuller made or communicated their decision on Feb. 16, it
deprives language of all meaning to describe the contract as coming to an end
automatically. It was, indeed, because the contract did not come to an end
automatically on Jan. 29, that Wijsmuller needed a fortnight to review their
schedules and their commercial options. I cannot, furthermore, reconcile
Wijsmuller’s argument with the reasoning or the decision in 
Maritime National Fish
Ltd
. In that case the Privy Council declined to speculate why the charterers
selected three of the five vessels to be licensed but, as I understand the case,
regarded the interposition of human choice after the allegedly frustrating event as
fatal to the plea of frustration. If Wijsmuller are entitled to succeed here, I cannot
see why the charterers lost there. The cases on frustrating delay do not, I think,
help Wijsmuller since it is actual and prospective delay (whether or not recognized
as frustrating by a party at the time) which frustrates the contract, not a party’s
election or decision to treat the delay as frustrating. I have no doubt that force
majeure clauses are, where their terms permit, to be construed and applied as in
the commodity cases on which Wijsmuller relied, but it is in my view inconsistent
with the doctrine of frustration as previously understood on high authority that its
application should depend on any decision, however reasonable and commercial,
of the party seeking to rely on it.
I reach the same conclusion as the Judge for the reasons which he lucidly and
persuasively gave.
Question 2(b)
The issue between the parties was short and fundamental: what is meant by
saying that a frustrating event, to be relied on, must occur without the fault or
default, or without blame attaching to, the party relying on it?
[Counsel for the defendant’s] answer was that a party was precluded from
relying on an event only when he had acted deliberately or in breach of an
actionable duty in causing it. Those conditions were not met here since it was not
alleged Wijsmuller sank 
Super Servant Two
 
deliberately and at the material time
Wijsmuller owed Lauritzen no duty of care.
[Counsel for the plaintiffs] argued for a less restrictive approach …
[The defendant’s] test would, in my judgment, confine the law in a legalistic
strait-jacket and distract attention from the real question, which is whether the
frustrating event relied upon is truly an outside event or extraneous change of
situation or whether it is an event which the party seeking to rely on it had the
means and opportunity to prevent but nevertheless caused or permitted to come
about. A fine test of legal duty is inappropriate; what is needed is a pragmatic
judgment whether a party seeking to rely on an event as discharging him from a
contractual promise was himself responsible for the occurrence of that event.
Lauritzen have pleaded in some detail the grounds on which they say that
Super Servant Two
 
was lost as a result of the carelessness of Wijsmuller, their
servants or agents. If those allegations are made good to any significant extent
Wijsmuller would (even if my answer to Question 2(a) is wrong) be precluded from
relying on their plea of frustration.
I would answer this question also as the Judge did and would therefore dismiss
the appeal.
Dillon LJ
Issues 2(a) and (b) are concerned with frustration. Was the contract frustrated by
the sinking of 
Super Servant Two
 
or by that event coupled with the subsequent
election by the defendants to use 
Super Servant One
 
on other voyages and not for
carrying the 
Dan King
? 
The important factor, common to both issues, is that under
the contract the defendants could have satisfied their obligation by using 
Super
Servant One
 
to carry the rig, after 
Super Servant Two
 
had sunk, but they elected
not to do so.
In this respect, the present case appears to be a direct parallel to that
described by Lord Wright in 
Maritime National Fish Ltd
 
v. 
Ocean Trawlers Ltd
[1935] AC 524 at pp. 529–530 where he said:
‘ … in [their Lordships] judgment the case could be properly decided on the simple conclusion that it was
the act and election of the appellants which prevented the St. Cuthbert being licensed for fishing with an
otter trawl. It is clear that the appellants were free to select any three of the five trawlers they were
operating and could, had they willed, have selected the St. Cuthbert as one, in which event a licence
would have been granted to her. It is immaterial to speculate why they preferred to put forward for
licences the three trawlers which they actually selected nor is it material, as between the appellants and
the respondents, that the appellants were operating other trawlers to three of which they gave the
preference. What matters is that they could have got a licence for the St. Cuthbert if they had so minded.
If the case be figured as one in which the St. Cuthbert was removed from the category of privileged
trawlers, it was by the appellant’s hand that she was so removed because it was their hand that guided
the hand of the Minister in placing the licences where he did and thereby excluding the St. Cuthbert. The
essence of “frustration” is that it should not be due to the act or election of the party.’
The parallel seems to be even closer, if, as some of the documents seem to
suggest, the defendants, after the loss of the 
Super Servant Two
, negotiated extra
fees with the parties with whom they had other contracts of carriage before finally
allocating the 
Super Servant One
 
to perform those other contracts.
It is the view of Professor Treitel, expressed both in his own book on the Law of
Contract—see the 7th edn at pp. 674–675 and 700–701—and in the current
editions of well-known textbooks of which he is editor or an editor, that where a
party has entered into a number of contracts with other parties and an
uncontemplated supervening event has the result that he is deprived of the means
of satisfying all those contracts, he can, provided he acts ‘reasonably’ in making
his election, elect to use such means as remains available to him to perform some
of the contracts, and claim that the others, which he does not perform, have been
frustrated by the supervening event. The reasoning depends on the proposition
that if it is known to those concerned that the party will have entered into
commitments with others and if he acts ‘reasonably’ in his allocation of his
remaining means to his commitments, the chain of causation between the
uncontemplated supervening event and the non-performance of those of his
contracts which will not have been performed will not have been broken by the
election to apply his remaining means in a ‘reasonable’ way. Similar reasoning
was, as my Lord has pointed out, used by Mr Justice Robert Goff in relation to an
exceptions clause in the unreported case of 
Westfälische Central-Genossenschaft
GmbH
 
v. 
Seabright Chemicals Ltd
.
Such an approach is however inconsistent to my mind with the view expressed
by Lord Wright in that passage in 
Maritime National Fish
 
which I have already
cited, where he said:
‘It is immaterial to speculate why they preferred to put forward for licences the three trawlers which they
actually selected.’
It is also, as my Lord has pointed out, inconsistent with the long accepted view that
frustration brings the contract to an end forthwith, without more ado automatically.
Plainly the 
sinking of 
Super Servant Two
 
did not do that, since even after that
sinking the defendants could have used 
Super Servant One
 
to perform the
contract.
We in this Court should apply 
Maritime National Fish
 
and the other authorities
to which my Lord has referred. Accordingly I agree with my Lord and the learned
Judge that issues 2(a) and (b) should be answered in the negative.
Commentary
The 
Super Servant Two
 
is a case of considerable significance. This is so for a number of
reasons. First, it demonstrates the practical significance of force majeure clauses. The
defendants found some protection in clause 17 but not in the doctrine of frustration.
Indeed, in many ways the narrowness of the doctrine of frustration can be explained on
the basis that it is open to the parties to protect their own position by an appropriately
drafted force majeure clause (see 
12.3.5
). Secondly, it is an important case in relation to
the interpretation of force majeure clauses in that it demonstrates that the courts are
unlikely to conclude, in the absence of very clear words, that a force majeure clause is
apt to encompass events caused by the negligence of the party relying upon the clause.
The reason for this is that the events listed in the clause are generally events that are
beyond the control of the parties (such as ‘acts of God’, ‘wars’, etc.) and, this being the
case, the court is likely to presume that all events listed in the clause are beyond their
control.
Thirdly, the case demonstrates that a party who has been at fault will generally not be
entitled to invoke the doctrine of frustration. The defendants in 
Super Servant Two
argued that it was only when they had acted deliberately or were in breach of a duty of
care which they owed to the plaintiffs that they would be precluded from relying upon
the doctrine of frustration. Bingham LJ rejected this submission on the ground that it
would ‘confine the law in a legalistic strait-jacket’. The view adopted by the Court of
Appeal was that a frustrating event must, by definition, take place ‘without blame or
fault on the side of the party seeking to rely’ upon the doctrine of frustration. So, if the
sinking of Super Servant Two occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendants,
that of itself would have sufficed to prevent the defendants from relying upon
frustration.
The final point relates to the fact that the defendants had a choice as to the allocation of
Super Servant One. In the view of the Court of Appeal the fact that the defendants had a
choice meant that the alleged frustrating event was brought about by their own act or
election and not by a supervening event. Adopting a strict approach to the interpretation
of the decision of the Privy Council in 
Maritime National Fish Ltd
 
v. 
Ocean Trawlers
Ltd
 
[1935] AC 524, the Court of Appeal held that it was irrelevant that the defendants in
Super Servant Two
 
had no 
real
 
choice as to the allocation of Super Servant One in that
it was impossible to allocate it to the performance of all concluded contracts. Cases
relied upon to support the proposition that the defendants could invoke the doctrine of
frustration if they had acted reasonably in their allocation of Super Servant One were
distinguished on the ground that they were concerned with the interpretation of force
majeure clauses and not with the doctrine of frustration. This conclusion would appear
to leave a party in the position of the defendants in this case in a very difficult position.
Two practical steps can be taken to mitigate the rigours of the decision. The first is to
eliminate any choice on the part of the defendants. Bingham LJ stated that, had the
contract been to perform the contract with Super Servant Two, the sinking of that vessel,
without negligence on the part of the defendants, would 
have entitled the defendants to
seek relief under the doctrine of frustration. The second step is to insert an
appropriately drafted force majeure clause into the contract. This takes us back to our
first point, namely the crucial role played by force majeure clauses in modern
commercial contracts.
21.5
 
Frustrating Events
It is only in the rare case where (i) the contract does not make provision for the event
that has occurred, (ii) the event was not foreseen by the parties and was not sufficiently
foreseeable, and (iii) the alleged frustrating event was not ‘self-induced’ that a court has
to decide whether or not a contract has been frustrated. Cases involving frustrated
contracts can be divided into three groups.
21.5.1
 
Impossibility
The classic example of a frustrated contract is a contract that has become impossible to
perform. 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
(
21.1
) falls into this category. 
Taylor
 
was a case of partial
rather than total impossibility in that it was still possible for the parties to make use of
the Surrey Gardens. But use of the Gardens only would have been a very different
contract from that which had originally been concluded by the parties. A contract of
employment is frustrated on the death of the employee. More difficult is the case where
the employee becomes incapacitated. Much depends upon the extent of the incapacity;
the greater it is, both in extent and duration, the more likely it is that the contract of
employment will be frustrated. A contract may also be frustrated where the subject
matter of the contract is unavailable for use in the performance of the contract (
Jackson
v. 
Union Marine Insurance Co Ltd
 
(1874) LR 10 CP 125, where the charter of a ship
which subsequently ran aground was held to have been frustrated as a result of the
unavailability of the vessel for the contracted voyage). Where the unavailability is partial
only (that is to say it is only unavailable for a proportion of the contract period) the
court must have regard to the extent of the unavailability. The greater the extent, in
relation to the time-scale of the contract, the more likely it is that the contract will be
frustrated (
The Nema
 
[1982] AC 724).
21.5.2
 
Illegality
The second group of cases concerns contracts that have become illegal after the date of
formation. These cases differ from cases where the illegality affected the contract from
the outset. Cases that fall within this section are contracts that were valid when formed
but have become illegal as a result of the occurrence of events subsequent to the making
of the contract. An example is provided by the case of 
Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna
 
v.
Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd
 
[1943] AC 32. A contract to sell machinery to
buyers in Poland was frustrated when Poland was occupied by Germany in the Second
World War (it being illegal to trade with the enemy in times of war). Public policy
considerations operate very strongly in this area (
Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping
Lines
 
v. 
Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association (Bermuda) Ltd
 
[2010] EWHC
2661 (Comm), [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 195, [100]). In cases involving subsequent illegality,
the operation of the doctrine of frustration cannot be excluded by an express term of the
contract (
Ertel Bieber and Co
 
v. 
Rio Tinto Co Ltd
 
[1918] 
AC 260) nor can it be excluded
on the ground that the supervening illegality was foreseen by the contracting parties.
The reason for this is that public policy considerations will generally deny to contracting
parties the entitlement to provide that the agreement is to be performed
notwithstanding any illegality. In other words, public policy here trumps the autonomy
of the contracting parties. A contract governed by English law is not, as a general rule,
affected by the validity of the contract according to the law of another jurisdiction unless
performance has become illegal by the law of the jurisdiction where performance is to
take place (a rule affirmed by Marcus Smith J in 
Canary Wharf (BP4) T1 Ltd
 
v.
European Medicines Agency
 
[2019] EWHC 335 (Ch), 183 Con LR 167).
Difficult questions can arise where the supervening illegality affects part only of the
contract. These cases involve questions of degree. The court must examine the impact of
the illegality on the contract. Where the illegality affects the contract in a substantial or a
fundamental way then the contract is likely to be frustrated (
Denny, Mott & Dickson
 
v.
James B Fraser & Co Ltd
 
[1944] AC 265). Conversely, where its impact is insubstantial
the contract will not be frustrated (
Cricklewood Property & Investment Trust Ltd
 
v.
Leightons Investment Trust Ltd
 
[1945] AC 221).
21.5.3
 
Frustration of Purpose
The most difficult cases are those in which it is alleged that the purpose of the contract
has been frustrated. The courts have exercised considerable caution in order to ensure
that frustration does not become a convenient escape route for a party who discovers
that he has entered into a bad bargain. More often than not, attempts to invoke the
doctrine of frustration in this context have failed (see, for example, 
Davis Contractors
Ltd
 
v. 
Fareham Urban District Council
 
[1956] AC 696, 
21.1
; 
Amalgamated Investment
& Property Co Ltd
 
v. 
John Walker & Sons Ltd
 
[1977] 1 WLR 164; and 
Canary Wharf
(BP4) T1 Ltd
 
v. 
European Medicines Agency
 
[2019] EWHC 335 (Ch), 183 Con LR 167).
The case that gives rise to difficulty is the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Krell
 
v.
Henry
 
[1903] 2 KB 740. It gives rise to difficulty on two grounds. First, why did the
Court of Appeal conclude that the contract had been frustrated? Secondly, what is the
difference between 
Krell
 
(where the contract was frustrated) and the decision of the
Court of Appeal in 
Herne Bay Steam Boat Company
 
v. 
Hutton
 
[1903] 2 KB 683, later in
this section (where the contract was not frustrated)? It is important to examine 
Krell
and 
Hutton
 
together (alongside the example given by Vaughan Williams LJ in 
Krell
 
of
the cab driver who agrees to take a passenger to Epsom on Derby Day). The commentary
will therefore follow the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Hutton.
KRELL V. HENRY
[1903] 2 KB 740, Court of Appeal
Krell owned a flat on the third floor at 56A Pall Mall. As it had been announced that
the King’s coronation procession would pass along Pall Mall on 26 and 27 June
1902, Henry agreed to hire Krell’s flat on those days. On 20 June Krell and Henry
entered into a written contract which made no reference to the coronation
processions or to any other purpose for which the flat was taken. The agreement
stated that Henry was to have ‘the entire use of these rooms during the days (but
not the nights)’. Henry paid a deposit of £25 and 
agreed to pay the balance of £50
on 24 June. The King became seriously ill and the coronation procession did not
take place. Henry refused to pay the balance and Krell brought an action to
recover it. Henry counterclaimed for the return of the £25. The trial judge held that
Henry was not liable to pay the £50 and that he was entitled to the return of the
£25. Krell appealed to the Court of Appeal who dismissed the appeal and held that
he was not entitled to demand the balance of £50 on the ground that the contract
between the parties had been frustrated.
Vaughan Williams LJ
The real question in this case is the extent of the application in English law of the
principle of the Roman law which has been adopted and acted on in many English
decisions, and notably in the case of 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
3 B & S 826 … English law
applies the principle not only to cases where the performance of the contract
becomes impossible by the cessation of existence of the thing which is the subject
matter of the contract, but also to cases where the event which renders the
contract incapable of performance is the cessation or non-existence of an express
condition or state of things, going to the root of the contract, and essential to its
performance. It is said, on the one side, that the specified thing, state of things, or
condition the continued existence of which is necessary for the fulfilment of the
contract, so that the parties entering into the contract must have contemplated the
continued existence of that thing, condition, or state of things as the foundation of
what was to be done under the contract, is limited to things which are either the
subject matter of the contract or a condition or state of things, present or
anticipated, which is expressly mentioned in the contract. But, on the other side, it
is said that the condition or state of things need not be expressly specified, but that
it is sufficient if that condition or state of things clearly appears by extrinsic
evidence to have been assumed by the parties to be the foundation or basis of the
contract, and the event which causes the impossibility is of such a character that it
cannot reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the
contracting parties when the contract was made. In such a case the contracting
parties will not be held bound by the general words which, though large enough to
include, were not used with reference to a possibility of a particular event rendering
performance of the contract impossible. I do not think that the principle of the civil
law as introduced into the English law is limited to cases in which the event
causing the impossibility of performance is the destruction or non-existence of
some thing which is the subject matter of the contract or of some condition or state
of things expressly specified as a condition of it. I think that you first have to
ascertain, not necessarily from the terms of the contract, but, if required, from
necessary inferences, drawn from surrounding circumstances recognised by both
contracting parties, what is the substance of the contract, and then to ask the
question whether that substantial contract needs for its foundation the assumption
of the existence of a particular state of things. If it does, this will limit the operation
of the general words, and in such case, if the contract becomes impossible of
performance by reason of the non-existence of the state of things assumed by
both contracting parties as the foundation of the contract, there will be no breach of
the contract thus limited. Now what are the facts of the present case?
[He set out the facts and continued]
In my judgment the use of the rooms was let and taken for the purpose of
seeing the Royal procession. It was not a demise of the rooms, or even an
agreement to let and take the rooms. It is a licence to use rooms for a particular
purpose and none other. And in my judgment the taking place of those processions
on the days proclaimed along the proclaimed 
route, which passed 56A, Pall Mall,
was regarded by both contracting parties as the foundation of the contract; and I
think that it cannot reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of
the contracting parties, when the contract was made, that the coronation would not
be held on the proclaimed days, or the processions not take place on those days
along the proclaimed route; and I think that the words imposing on the defendant
the obligation to accept and pay for the use of the rooms for the named days,
although general and unconditional, were not used with reference to the possibility
of the particular contingency which afterwards occurred. It was suggested in the
course of the argument that if the occurrence, on the proclaimed days, of the
coronation and the procession in this case were the foundation of the contract, and
if the general words are thereby limited or qualified, so that in the event of the non-
occurrence of the coronation and procession along the proclaimed route they
would discharge both parties from further performance of the contract, it would
follow that if a cabman was engaged to take some one to Epsom on Derby Day at
a suitable enhanced price for such a journey, say 10l., both parties to the contract
would be discharged in the contingency of the race at Epsom for some reason
becoming impossible; but I do not think this follows, for I do not think that in the cab
case the happening of the race would be the foundation of the contract. No doubt
the purpose of the engager would be to go to see the Derby, and the price would
be proportionately high; but the cab had no special qualifications for the purpose
which led to the selection of the cab for this particular occasion. Any other cab
would have done as well. Moreover, I think that, under the cab contract, the hirer,
even if the race went off, could have said, ‘Drive me to Epsom; I will pay you the
agreed sum; you have nothing to do with the purpose for which I hired the cab’,
and that if the cabman refused he would have been guilty of a breach of contract,
there being nothing to qualify his promise to drive the hirer to Epsom on a
particular day. Whereas in the case of the coronation, there is not merely the
purpose of the hirer to see the coronation procession, but it is the coronation
procession and the relative position of the rooms which is the basis of the contract
as much for the lessor as the hirer; and I think that if the King, before the
coronation day and after the contract, had died, the hirer could not have insisted
on having the rooms on the days named. It could not in the cab case be
reasonably said that seeing the Derby race was the foundation of the contract, as it
was of the licence in this case. Whereas in the present case, where the rooms
were offered and taken, by reason of their peculiar suitability from the position of
the rooms for a view of the coronation procession, surely the view of the
coronation procession was the foundation of the contract, which is a very different
thing from the purpose of the man who engaged the cab—namely, to see the race
—being held to be the foundation of the contract. Each case must be judged by its
own circumstances. In each case one must ask oneself, first, what, having regard
to all the circumstances, was the foundation of the contract? Secondly, was the
performance of the contract prevented? Thirdly, was the event which prevented the
performance of the contract of such a character that it cannot reasonably be said
to have been in the contemplation of the parties at the date of the contract? If all
these questions are answered in the affirmative (as I think they should be in this
case), I think both parties are discharged from further performance of the contract.
Romer LJ
With some doubt I have also come to the conclusion that this case is governed by
the principle on which 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
was decided, and accordingly that the
appeal must be dismissed. The doubt I have felt was whether the parties to the
contract now before us could be said, under the circumstances, not to have had at
all in their contemplation the risk that for some reason or other the coronation
processions might not take place on the days fixed, or, if the 
processions took
place, might not pass so as to be capable of being viewed from the rooms
mentioned in the contract; and whether, under this contract, that risk was not
undertaken by the defendant. But on the question of fact as to what was in the
contemplation of the parties at the time, I do not think it right to differ from the
conclusion arrived at by Vaughan Williams LJ.
Stirling LJsaid he had an opportunity of reading the judgment delivered by
Vaughan Williams LJ, with which he entirely agreed. Though the case was one of
very great difficulty, he thought it came within the principle of 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell

HERNE BAY STEAM BOAT COMPANY V. HUTTON
[1903] 2 KB 683, Court of Appeal
The Herne Bay Steam Boat Company owned a steamboat called 
Cynthia
. Early in
1902 it was announced that there would be a Royal naval review at Spithead on 28
June 1902. Hutton, the defendant, wanted to charter 
Cynthia
 
to carry passengers
to see the review. Herne Bay and Hutton signed an agreement on 23 May 1902,
which stated that 
Cynthia
 
would be at the disposal of Hutton on 28 June ‘for the
purpose of viewing the naval review and for a day’s cruise round the fleet’ and on
29 June ‘for similar purposes’. Hutton paid a deposit of £50 and agreed to pay the
balance of £200 before 
Cynthia
 
left Herne Bay. On 25 June the naval review was
cancelled. On the same day Herne Bay wired Hutton for instructions, stating that
Cynthia
 
was ready to start, but received no reply. On 28 and 29 June Herne Bay
used 
Cynthia
 
for its own purposes and made a profit of £90. On 29 June, Hutton
called Herne Bay and stated that, as the naval review had been cancelled, he no
longer required 
Cynthia
 
and would not pay the balance of £200. Herne Bay
brought an action to recover £110. Hutton counterclaimed for the return of his £50
deposit. The judge held that Herne Bay was not entitled to the £110 but that Hutton
was not entitled to the £50. The Court of Appeal allowed Herne Bay’s appeal. It
held that the contract between the parties had not been frustrated and that Herne
Bay was accordingly entitled to recover £110 from Hutton by way of damages for
his breach of contract.
Vaughan Williams LJ
Mr Hutton, in hiring this vessel, had two objects in view: first, of taking people to
see the naval review, and, secondly, of taking them round the fleet. Those, no
doubt, were the purposes of Mr Hutton, but it does not seem to me that because,
as it is said, those purposes became impossible, it would be a very legitimate
inference that the happening of the naval review was contemplated by both parties
as the basis and foundation of this contract, so as to bring the case within the
doctrine of 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
3 B & S 826. On the contrary, when the contract is
properly regarded, I think the purpose of Mr Hutton, whether of seeing the naval
review or of going round the fleet with a party of paying guests, does not lay the
foundation of the contract within the authorities …
I see nothing that makes this contract differ from a case where, for instance, a
person has engaged a brake to take himself and a party to Epsom to see the races
there, but for some reason or other, such as the spread of an infectious disease,
the races are postponed. In such a case it could not be said that he could be
relieved of his bargain. So in the present case it is sufficient to say that the
happening of the naval review was not the foundation of the contract.
Romer LJ
This case is not one in which the subject matter of the contract is a mere licence to
the defendant to use a ship for the purpose of seeing the naval review and going
round the fleet. In my opinion, as my Lord has said, it is a contract for the hiring of
a ship by the defendant for a certain voyage, though having, no doubt, a special
object, namely, to see the naval review and the fleet; but it appears to me that the
object was a matter with which the defendant, as hirer of the ship, was alone
concerned, and not the plaintiffs, the owners of the ship.
The case cannot, in my opinion, be distinguished in principle from many
common cases in which, on the hiring of a ship, you find the objects of the hiring
stated. Very often you find the details of the voyage stated with particularity, and
also the nature and details of the cargo to be carried. If the voyage is intended to
be one of pleasure, the object in view may also be stated, which is a matter that
concerns the passengers. But this statement of the objects of the hirer of the ship
would not, in my opinion, justify him in saying that the owner of the ship had those
objects just as much in view as the hirer himself. The owner would say, ‘I have an
interest in the ship as a passenger or cargo carrying machine, and I enter into the
contract simply in that capacity; it is for the hirer to concern himself about the
objects’.
… The ship (as a ship) had nothing particular to do with the review or the fleet
except as a convenient carrier of passengers to see it: any other ship suitable for
carrying passengers would have done equally as well. Just as in the case of the
hire of a cab or other vehicle, although the object of the hirer might be stated, that
statement would not make the object any the less a matter for the hirer alone, and
would not directly affect the person who was letting out the vehicle for hire. In the
present case I may point out that it cannot be said that by reason of the failure to
hold the naval review there was a total failure of consideration. That cannot be so.
Nor is there anything like a total destruction of the subject matter of the contract.
Nor can we, in my opinion, imply in this contract any condition in favour of the
defendant which would enable him to escape liability. A condition ought only to be
implied in order to carry out the presumed intention of the parties, and I cannot
ascertain any such presumed intention here. It follows that, in my opinion, so far as
the plaintiffs are concerned, the objects of the passengers on this voyage with
regard to sight-seeing do not form the subject matter or essence of this contract.
Stirling LJ
It is said that, by reason of the reference in the contract to the ‘naval review’, the
existence of the review formed the basis of the contract, and that as the review
failed to take place the parties became discharged from the further performance of
the contract, in accordance with the doctrine of 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
3 B & S 826. I
am unable to arrive at that conclusion. It seems to me that the reference in the
contract to the naval review is easily explained; it was inserted in order to define
more exactly the nature of the voyage, and I am unable to treat it as being such a
reference as to constitute the naval review the foundation of the contract so as to
entitle either party to the benefit of the doctrine in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
. I come to this
conclusion the more readily because the object of the voyage is not limited to the
naval review, but also extends to a cruise round the fleet. The fleet was there, and
passengers might have been found willing to go round it. It is true that in the event
which happened the object of the voyage became limited, but, in my opinion, that
was the risk of the defendant whose venture the taking the passengers was. For
these reasons I am unable to agree with the learned judge in holding that in the
contemplation of the parties the taking place of the review was the basis for the
performance of the contract, and I think that the defendant is not discharged from
its performance.
Commentary
Krell
 
is a difficult case: it has its supporters and its critics. It has never been overruled
but, at the same time, the courts have been reluctant to apply it in other contexts. What
is the difference between 
Krell
 
and 
Hutton?
 
And why is a contract to hire a room for the
purpose of viewing the coronation frustrated on the cancellation of the coronation when
a contract to pay a cab driver a suitably enhanced price to take a passenger to Epsom on
Derby Day is not frustrated on the cancellation of the Derby? The most extensive judicial
analysis of these questions as a matter of English law is to be found in the judgment of
Marcus Smith J in 
Canary Wharf (BP4) T1 Ltd
 
v. 
European Medicines Agency
 
[2019]
EWHC 335 (Ch), 183 Con LR 167 in the following terms:
37 (1) The reason Vaughan Williams LJ considered [his example] of the hire of the cab to Epsom on Derby Day
to be such a clear example of a non-frustrating event is because the cab driver’s price was simply a reflection of
an excess of demand for cabs over their supply, with the cab driver’s price being correspondingly high as a
result. In short, the high price was simply a reflection of market forces, with the cab driver being entirely
indifferent as to the purpose of the journey and indeed its destination, whilst the passenger would be concerned
not with the identity of the cab driver, but merely with the objective of securing a cab—any cab—to go to the
stated destination. The high price, in other words, is nothing to do with a common purpose, but entirely a
reflection of the opposing interests of cab driver and passenger, mediated through the market forces of supply
and demand. In the case of this example, the market forces enabled the cab driver to charge a premium: the fact
that, the premium having been agreed, the passenger’s underlying purpose of the journey fell away, would be a
matter of indifference to the cab driver.
(2) The point could be tested in the following way: suppose the passenger wanted to make the journey for an
altogether different purpose (to visit a relative in Epsom), but was forced to pay a higher price because of the
coincidence of the timing of the visit to the relative and the Epsom races. The cancellation of the race might well
have an effect on market price (demand for cabs would fall), but one could surely not say that the ‘purpose’ of
the contract had been undermined by the cancellation of the race: the relative would still be in Epsom to be
visited. Conversely, if the relative became unavailable to be visited, but the races still went on, the passenger
(whose purpose would have been thwarted) would still be held to the contract.
(3) In the 
Herne Bay
 
case … the defendant was taking advantage of the review (occasioned by the
Coronation) to make a profit through his own venture. No doubt he paid more for hiring the vessel than he
would have done but for the Coronation; but, equally, would have more passengers and/or be able to charge
more to the passengers for the same reason. The risk of an absence of high demand for the trips he was offering
was the defendant’s. The cancellation of the review doubtless meant that fewer people would want to buy tickets
from the defendant. But the venture was always possible: it is simply that one factor adversely affecting demand
arose subsequent to the contract. As the Court of Appeal said, the venture was the defendant’s alone, as was the
risk of the venture failing. As in the case of the cab driver, the interests and purposes of the parties to the
contract were in essence opposed: each, in his own way, was trying to make a profit out of the occasion.
(4) In 
Krell v. Henry
 
… what the parties were buying and selling was, quite literally, a room with a view.
Their common purpose was just that: whilst the parties surely would have been in opposition in bargaining on
price, the thing that they were bargaining about was predicated on the procession taking place. Matters would
have been very different had the room been a 
hotel room charging a higher rate because of the higher demand
for rooms on that particular day due to the Coronation.
38.
 
The coronation cases show that where the supervening event causes one party to appreciate—with the
benefit of hindsight—that he or she has made a bad bargain, there will be no frustration of a common purpose.
If the only effect of the supervening event is to cause the price for the bargain to appear—in hindsight—to be too
high, the contract will not be frustrated. (By ‘price’ I should stress that I mean more than simply the
consideration agreed to be paid, but all of the terms that go to define the benefit one party to the contract
confers on the other.) That was the position both in the case of Vaughan Williams LJ’s cab driver and in the
facts of the 
Herne Bay
 
case. In both of those cases, one party paid more due to market conditions that
subsequently changed: the passenger paid more because of the high demand due to the races; the defendant in
Herne Bay
 
paid more because of the naval review. In each case, were the price bargained for to be adjusted in
the light of the new, supervening, market conditions, neither party would be able to complain. That
demonstrates that there was, in these cases, no common purpose to be frustrated: one party was simply
complaining that he had made what was, in retrospect, a bad bargain. By contrast, even if the price paid by the
licensee in 
Krell v. Henry
 
were to be dramatically reduced, the purpose of the contract would still be
undermined. In 
Krell v. Henry
, the point of the contract was the purchase and sale of a room with a view: the
view never came to pass.
One difficulty with this analysis lies in the claim that the ‘price’ charged is simply a
reflection of the operation of market forces rather than a reflection of the importance
which the parties have attached to performance taking place at the agreed time and on
the agreed terms. Thus a passenger may be willing to pay an ‘enhanced’ price for a
service not because of the operation of market forces but because he or she wishes to
ensure that a particular purpose is achieved (and the acceptance of the higher price by
the service provider may evidence his or her acceptance of that purpose so that it
becomes the ‘common’ purpose of the parties).
On the facts of 
Canary Wharf (BP4) T1 Ltd
 
v. 
European Medicines Agency
 
the EMA
claimed that the effect of Brexit would be to frustrate a twenty-five-year underlease into
which it had entered with the claimant in 2014. The EMA’s primary case was that, as an
agency of the EU, it could no longer lawfully occupy premises outside of the EU so that
the effect of Brexit would be to frustrate the underlease by supervening illegality. This
claim was rejected because it was found that there was no relevant supervening
illegality. The EMA’s secondary case was that the effect of Brexit was to frustrate the
common purpose of the underlease, which was that the EMA would occupy the premises
as its permanent headquarters through to 2039. Marcus Smith J held (at [244]–[245])
that the parties had no such common purpose. The fact that the underlease contained
provisions permitting assignment and sub-letting of the premises in limited
circumstances was fatal to the claim that the parties’ intention was that the EMA would
occupy the premises for the entirety of the term of the underlease. Further, there was
held to be no common purpose beyond the purpose to be derived from the terms of the
underlease. Outside the terms of the underlease the purposes of the parties were held to
be ‘divergent’ rather than common because the EMA was focused on ‘bespoke premises,
with the greatest flexibility as to term, and the lowest rent’, while the claimant landlords
were focused on ‘long-term cash flow, at the highest rate’ and they were prepared to
allow the EMA to influence the configuration of the building, provided that this was not
adverse to their own interests. This being the case, the underlease was not the outcome
of the parties’ common purpose but was the product of ‘rival negotiations driven by
different
 
objectives 
([218(2)]). It was therefore an arm’s length bargain where the
parties were looking after their own interests, and the only common purpose was to be
found in the terms of the underlease. The fact that, with the benefit of hindsight, the
agreement turned out to be a poor one for the EMA (both in relation to the term of the
underlease and the restrictions on its ability to assign the underlease or sub-let the
premises) was held to be insufficient to amount to a case of frustration. It was thus held
not to be a case which was analogous to 
Krell
.
A more convincing analysis of 
Krell
 
has been provided by Professor Treitel (
Frustration
and Force Majeure
 
(3rd edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2014), para 7–014) in the following
terms:
The contract in [
Krell
] was not simply one which granted a licence to use the rooms at an unusually high price.
It was a contract to provide facilities for viewing the coronation processions or, as Lord Phillips MR has stated,
one for a ‘room with a view’. There was not, indeed, any undertaking in it that the processions would take place,
or that they could be viewed from the rooms. In this respect, the contract differed from the contract that is made
by buying a theatre or concert ticket: performance of such a contract would become impossible if supervening
events led to the cancellation of the play or concert. In 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
 
there was no such impossibility. … But it
was the common purpose of both parties that facilities for viewing the processions should be provided: in the
words of Vaughan Williams LJ, the provision of such facilities was the crucial point ‘as much for the lessor as
the hirer’. In the other examples, there was either no such common purpose … or the common purpose was not
wholly defeated. The latter point reflects a recurrent feature of the cases on frustration of purpose, which shows
that the approach of the law to partial frustration of purpose differs from that which it adopts to partial
impossibility. In cases of partial impossibility, a contract can be discharged if its 
main
 
purpose can no longer be
achieved; but in cases of frustration of purpose the courts have applied the more rigorous test of asking whether
any
 
part of the contractual purpose (other than a part which was wholly trivial) could still be achieved: if so,
they have refused to apply the doctrine of discharge. … In [the 
Herne Bay
 
case,] naval review may have formed
the hirer’s principal inducement to enter into the contract, but the continued presence of the fleet at Spithead
also provided a considerable and unusual attraction, and it was one of the purposes of the contract to give the
hirer the opportunity of taking advantage of this attraction for commercial purposes. In 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
, by
contrast, it was no part of the contractual purpose that Mr Henry should be able to look out of the window to
watch the ordinary London traffic which continued to pass down Pall Mall on the two days in question. 
Krell
 
v.
Henry
 
seems, with respect, to have been correctly decided on the basis that it was the common purpose of both
parties that facilities for watching the processions were to be provided under the contract, and the cancellation
of the processions had prevented the achievement of that common purpose (although literal performance of the
contract had not become impossible). This emphasis on the requirement that the purpose of 
both
 
parties must
be frustrated is found also in other English and American cases. It means that the supervening event must
prevent one party from supplying, and the other from obtaining, what the former had contracted to provide and
the latter to acquire under the contract. In this sense, formulations of the doctrine in terms of the frustration of
the purpose of 
both
 
parties are preferable to those (occasionally found) which refer to the frustration of the
purpose of 
one
 
party only. The point can be illustrated by supposing that, in 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
, the coronation had
taken place as planned but Mr Henry had fallen ill and so been unable to watch the processions. In that case, his
purpose might have been frustrated, but the same could not have been said of Mr Krell’s purpose: that purpose,
being the provision of viewing facilities, would have been accomplished. Accordingly it is submitted that on
such facts, the contract should not have been discharged. [Emphasis in the original.]
On this basis 
Krell
 
is a very narrow decision indeed. Provided that the focus is kept on
the purpose of both parties to the contract the decision should be kept within limits and
not become an escape route for parties looking for a way out of a bad bargain.
An alternative explanation of 
Krell
 
has been provided by Posner CJ in 
Northern Indiana
Public Service Co
 
v. 
Carbon County Coal Co
, 799 F 2d 265. He stated (at p. 277):
The leading case on frustration remains 
Krell
 
v. 
Henry
 
[1903] 2 KB 740 (CA). Krell rented Henry a suite of
rooms for watching the coronation of Edward VII, but Edward came down with appendicitis and the coronation
had to be postponed. Henry refused to pay the balance of the rent and the court held that he was excused from
doing so because his purpose in renting had been frustrated by the postponement, a contingency outside the
knowledge, or power to influence, of either party. The question was, to which party did the contract (implicitly)
allocate the risk? Surely Henry had not intended to insure Krell against the possibility of the coronation’s being
postponed, since Krell could always relet the room, at the premium rental, for the coronation’s new date. So
Henry was excused.
Professor Treitel points out (para 7–012) that this rationalization of 
Krell
 
is not ‘wholly
compelling’. The ‘insurance’ argument runs into the difficulty that neither party may
have considered the possibility of insuring on the facts of the case. And the argument
that Mr Krell could always have relet the room encounters the factual difficulty that the
route of the procession which actually took place differed in some respects from the
cancelled procession. Professor Treitel also points out that the argument in relation to
the possibility of reletting the room seems to ‘involve a paradox in so far as it suggests
that Mr Krell’s claim for the balance of £50 would have been strengthened if (to imagine
the unthinkable) the coronation had been wholly cancelled because a Republic had been
declared’.
21.6
 
The Effects of Frustration
The effect of frustration is to discharge the contract automatically (
Hirji Mulji
 
v. 
Cheong
Yue Steamship Co Ltd
 
[1926] AC 497). Both parties are then released from their
obligations to perform the contract after the date of discharge without incurring any
liability for breach of contract in respect of their failure to perform these obligations.
Discharge is a drastic sanction. The parties may prefer to suspend the contract while
they wait to see what impact the event (such as a war) will have on the contract or they
may prefer to adjust the contract so that one party does not suffer undue hardship as a
result of the occurrence of the unexpected event. Parties who wish to make provision for
the suspension or adjustment of the contract should insert an appropriate clause in the
contract to that effect (a force majeure clause if suspension is the desired remedy and a
hardship clause if adjustment of the contract is the wished-for outcome).
The law of contract does not attempt to regulate the financial consequences of the
discharge of the contract on the ground of frustration. In the absence of a breach of
contract, there can be no action for damages for breach. Regulation of the financial
consequences of the frustration of a contract is a matter for the law of restitution (or, if
one prefers, the law of unjust enrichment). The law is now to be found largely in the Law
Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943. The Act has generated very little case-law.
There is, however, one notable exception and that is the litigation between BP
Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd and Mr Hunt. Although the case was appealed all the way up
to the House of Lords, the leading 
judicial exposition of the Act is to be found in the
judgment of the judge at first instance, Robert Goff J. Before examining the Act and the
case-law it is necessary to say something about the common law rules which pre-dated
the Act.
The development of the common law rules can be divided into two distinct stages. The
first stage was associated with the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Chandler
 
v.
Webster
 
[1904] 1 KB 493. 
Chandler
 
was another of the coronation cases. The principal
issue in 
Chandler
 
was the financial consequences of the frustration of the contract
between the parties. The Court of Appeal held that money paid under a contract prior to
it being frustrated could be recovered upon a total failure of consideration. But,
crucially, they held that, in order to constitute a total failure of consideration, the
contract had to be set aside 
ab initio
. Frustration does not have such a consequence. The
contract is set aside from the moment of the occurrence of the frustrating event but the
termination is not retrospective in its effect. This being the case, the party who paid the
money could not recover it because he could not demonstrate that there had been a total
failure of consideration. The loss therefore lay where it fell. A similar principle was
applicable in the case where services were performed prior to the frustration of the
contract. In 
Cutter
 
v. 
Powell
 
(1795) 6 TR 320 Mr Powell employed Mr Cutter as second
mate on a ship that was to sail from Jamaica to Liverpool. The level of pay offered by Mr
Powell was generous but the contract stated that the money was only payable after the
ship arrived in Liverpool provided that Mr Cutter had done his duty as second mate on
the journey. Mr Cutter died before the ship arrived in Liverpool. His death frustrated the
contract between the parties. His widow brought an action to recover the wages which
she alleged were due to her deceased husband in respect of the services he performed
prior to his death. Her claim failed. Mr Cutter was only entitled to payment on
completion of the voyage and, having failed to do so, he was not entitled to make any
claim for work done prior to the termination of the contract on his death.
The second stage in the development of the common law was the decision of the House
of Lords in 
Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna
 
v. 
Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd
 
[1943] AC
32. The House of Lords overruled 
Chandler
. While they affirmed that money paid was
recoverable upon a total failure of consideration, they rejected the proposition that it is
necessary to set aside the contract 
ab initio
 
in order to create such a total failure. In
order to establish a total failure of consideration the payor simply has to show that the
basis upon which he had paid the money has totally failed. An illustration of such a total
failure is provided by the facts of 
Fibrosa
 
itself. The respondents agreed to manufacture
machines for the appellants and to deliver them to Gdynia in Poland but, before delivery
could be effected, the contract was frustrated when Poland was occupied by the German
army. The House of Lords held that the appellants were entitled to recover their
prepayment of £1,000 on the ground that it had been paid for a consideration which had
wholly failed. The money had been paid for machinery and they had not received any
part of the machinery as a result of the outbreak of war. Not having received any part of
the performance for which they had contracted, they were entitled to recover their
money as on a total failure of consideration.
While 
Fibrosa
 
was an improvement upon 
Chandler
 
it still left the law in an
1.—
(2)
unsatisfactory state. First, money paid was only recoverable upon a 
total
 
failure of
consideration. Had the appellants in 
Fibrosa
 
received any part of the performance for
which they had contracted they would not have been entitled to recover their
prepayment. Secondly, the law did little to protect the interest of the recipient of the
money. It is likely that the respondents in 
Fibrosa
 
had acted to their detriment in
manufacturing the machinery for the appellants but any such detrimental reliance did
not give the respondents a claim against the appellants nor did it entitle them to set-off
their expenditure against the appellants’ claim to recover the 
prepayment they had
made. Thirdly, 
Fibrosa
 
did nothing to improve the position of the party who has
performed services prior to the frustration of the contract. The House of Lords was only
dealing with money claims and did not purport to deal with the case where the benefit
conferred on the other party took a form other than the payment of money.
Prior to 
Fibrosa
 
a Law Revision Committee report had been produced on the rule laid
down in 
Chandler
. While 
Fibrosa
 
solved some of the problems generated by 
Chandler
 
it
did not solve them all. Parliament therefore proceeded to enact legislation in the form of
the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943. For our purposes the principal
provisions are sections 1(2) and 1(3). Section 1(2) deals with the recovery of money,
while section 1(3) deals with recovery in respect of non-money benefits. The Act is a
short one and it is set out in full. The Act is then followed by an extract from the
judgment of Robert Goff J in 
BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd
 
v. 
Hunt (No 2)
 
[1979] 1
WLR 783. The opening part of that judgment is a very clear exposition of the central
provisions of the Act.

(a)
(b)
(4)
(5)
time of discharge’) shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from
him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums
were paid, and, in the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable:
Provided that, if the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable
incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the
performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so
having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as
the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or
payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.
Where any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any
other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract,
obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which the
last foregoing subsection applies) before the time of discharge, there shall
be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not
exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court
considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case and, in
particular,—
the amount of any expenses incurred before the time of discharge
by the benefited party in, or for the purpose of, the performance of
the contract, including any sums paid or payable by him to any other
party in pursuance of the contract and retained or recoverable by
that party under the last foregoing subsection, and
the effect, in relation to the said benefit, of the circumstances giving
rise to the frustration of the contract.
In estimating, for the purposes of the foregoing provisions of this section,
the amount of any expenses incurred by any party to the contract, the court
may, without prejudice to 
the generality of the said provisions, include such
sum as appears to be reasonable in respect of overhead expenses and in
respect of any work or services performed personally by the said party.
In considering whether any sum ought to be recovered or retained under
the foregoing provisions of this section by any party to the contract, the
court shall not take into account any sums which have, by reason of the
circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract, become payable
to that party under any contract of insurance unless there was an obligation
(6)

to insure imposed by an express term of the frustrated contract or by or
under any enactment.
Where any person has assumed obligations under the contract in
consideration of the conferring of a benefit by any other party to the
contract upon any other person, whether a party to the contract or not, the
court may, if in all the circumstances of the case it considers it just to do so,
treat for the purposes of subsection (3) of this section any benefit so
conferred as a benefit obtained by the person who has assumed the
obligations as aforesaid.
Provision as to application of this Act
(1) This Act shall apply to contracts, whether made before or after the
commencement of this Act, as respects which the time of discharge is on or
after the first day of July, nineteen hundred and forty-three, but not to
contracts as respects which the time of discharge is before the said date.
This Act shall apply to contracts to which the Crown is a party in like
manner as to contracts between subjects.
Where any contract to which this Act applies contains any provision which,
upon the true construction of the contract, is intended to have effect in the
event of circumstances arising which operate, or would but for the said
provision operate, to frustrate the contract, or is intended to have effect
whether such circumstances arise or not, the court shall give effect to the
said provision and shall only give effect to the foregoing section of this Act
to such extent, if any, as appears to the court to be consistent with the said
provision.
Where it appears to the court that a part of any contract to which this Act
applies can properly be severed from the remainder of the contract, being a
part wholly performed before the time of discharge, or so performed except
for the payment in respect of that part of the contract of sums which are or
can be ascertained under the contract, the court shall treat that part of the
contract as if it were a separate contract and had not been frustrated and
shall treat the foregoing section of this Act as only applicable to the
remainder of that contract.
This Act shall not apply—
(a)
(b)
(c)
to any charterparty, except a time charterparty or a charterparty by
way of demise, or to any contract (other than a charterparty) for the
carriage of goods by sea; or
to any contract of insurance, save as is provided by subsection (5)
of the foregoing section; or
to any contract to which section 7 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979
(which avoids contracts for the sale of specific goods which perish
before the risk has passed to the buyer) applies, or to any other
contract for the sale, or for the sale and delivery, of specific goods,
where the contract is frustrated by reason of the fact that the goods
have perished.
BP EXPLORATION CO (LIBYA) LTD V. HUNT (NO 2)
[1979] 1 WLR 783, Queen’s Bench Division
Mr Hunt was the owner of an oil concession granted by the Libyan government. He
did not have the resources to develop the concession himself, so he entered into a
joint venture with BP under which BP were to carry out the exploration and
development of the site and they also agreed to transfer to Mr Hunt certain ‘farm-
in’ contributions in cash and in oil. In return Mr Hunt agreed to grant BP a half
share of the concession and further agreed to repay, over a period of time, 125 per
cent of BP’s ‘farm-in’ contributions and his half share of the expenditure incurred in
the exploration and development of the fields. Payment was to be made in the
form of three-eighths of Mr Hunt’s share of the oil produced from the field until such
time as the reimbursement was complete. A giant oil field was discovered and the
field came on stream in 1967. Once the field came on stream it was agreed that
the costs of production would be divided equally between the parties. In 1971 BP’s
interest in the oil field was expropriated by the Libyan government and, in 1973, Mr
Hunt’s interest was also expropriated. At this point BP had received approximately
one-third of their reimbursement oil. BP claimed that the expropriation of the
interests in the oil field had frustrated the contract between the parties and that
they were entitled to the award of a ‘just sum’ under section 1(3) of the Law
Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943. The extract that follows concentrates on
(a)
(b)
(c)
the analysis of the Act itself. The application of the Act to the facts of the case will
be dealt with in the commentary that follows the extract.
Robert Goff J
(1)
 
The principle of recovery
The principle, which is common to both section 1(2) and (3), and indeed is
the fundamental principle underlying the Act itself, is prevention of the
unjust enrichment of either party to the contract at the other’s expense. …
Although section 1 (2) and (3) is concerned with restitution in respect of
different types of benefit, it is right to construe the two subsections as
flowing from the same basic principle and therefore, so far as their different
subject matters permit, to achieve consistency between them. Even so, it is
always necessary to bear in mind the difference between awards of
restitution in respect of money payments and awards where the benefit
conferred by the plaintiff does not consist of a payment of money. Money
has the peculiar character of a universal medium of exchange. By its
receipt, the recipient is inevitably benefited; and (subject to problems
arising from such matters as inflation, change of position and the time value
of money) the loss suffered by the plaintiff is generally equal to the
defendant’s gain, so that no difficulty arises concerning the amount to be
repaid. The same cannot be said of other benefits, such as goods or
services. By their nature, services cannot be restored; nor in many cases
can goods be restored, for example where they have been consumed or
transferred to another. Furthermore the identity and value of the resulting
benefit to the recipient may be debatable. From the very nature of things,
therefore, the problem of restitution in respect of such benefits is more
complex than in cases where the benefit takes the form of a money
payment; and the solution of the problem has been made no easier by the
form in which the legislature has chosen to draft section 1(3) of the Act.
The Act is not designed to do certain things: (i) It is not designed to
apportion the loss between the parties. There is no general power under
either section 1(2) or section 1(3) to make any allowance for expenses
incurred by the plaintiff (except, under the proviso to section 1(2), to enable
him to enforce pro tanto payment of a sum payable but unpaid before
(d)
frustration); and expenses incurred by the defendant are only relevant in so
far as they go to reduce the net benefit obtained by him and thereby limit
any award to the plaintiff. (ii) It is not concerned to put the parties in the
position in which they would have been if the contract had been performed.
(iii) It is not concerned to restore the parties to the position they were in
before the contract was made. A remedy designed to prevent unjust
enrichment may not achieve that result; for expenditure may be incurred by
either party under the contract which confers no benefit on the other, and in
respect of which no remedy is available under the Act.
An award under the Act may have the effect of rescuing the plaintiff from an
unprofitable bargain. This may certainly be true under section 1(2), if the
plaintiff has paid the price in advance for an expected return which, if
furnished, would have proved unprofitable; if the contract is frustrated
before any part of that expected return is received, and before any
expenditure is incurred by the defendant, the plaintiff is entitled to the return
of the price he has paid, irrespective of the consideration he would have
recovered had the contract been performed. Consistently with section 1(2),
there is nothing in section 1(3) which necessarily limits an award to the
contract consideration. But the contract consideration may nevertheless be
highly relevant to the assessment of the just sum to be awarded under
section 1(3); this is a matter to which I will revert later in this judgment.
(2)
 
Claims under section 1(2)
Where an award is made under section 1(2), it is, generally speaking, simply an
award for the repayment of money which has been paid to the defendant in
pursuance of the contract, subject to an allowance in respect of expenses incurred
by the defendant. It is not necessary that the consideration for the payment should
have wholly failed: claims under section 1(2) are not limited to cases of total failure
of consideration, and cases of partial failure of consideration can be catered for by
a cross-claim by the defendant under section 1(2) or section 1(3) or both. There is
no discretion in the court in respect of a claim under section 1(2), except in respect
of the allowance for expenses; subject to such an allowance (and, of course, a
cross-claim) the plaintiff is entitled to repayment of the money he has paid. The
allowance for expenses is probably best rationalised as a statutory recognition of
the defence of change of position. True, the expenses need not have been
(a)
incurred by reason of the plaintiff’s payment; but they must have been incurred in,
or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract under which the plaintiff’s
payment has been made, and for that reason it is just that they should be brought
into account. No provision is made in the subsection for any increase in the sum
recoverable by the plaintiff, or in the amount of expenses to be allowed to the
defendant, to allow for the time value of money. The money may have been paid,
or the expenses incurred, many years before the date of frustration; but the cause
of action accrues on that date, and the sum recoverable under the Act as at that
date can be no greater than the sum actually paid, though the defendant may have
had the use of the money over many years, and indeed may have profited from its
use. Of course, the question whether the court may award interest from the date of
the accrual of the cause of action is an entirely different matter. …
(3)
 
Claims under section 1(3)
General. In contrast, where an award is made under section 1(3), the
process is more complicated. First, it has to be shown that the defendant
has, by reason of something done by the plaintiff in, or for the purpose of,
the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a
payment of money) before the time of discharge. That benefit has to be
identified, and valued, and such value forms the upper limit of the award.
Secondly, the court may award to the plaintiff such sum, not greater than
the value of such benefit, as it considers just having regard to all the
circumstances of the case, including in particular the matters specified in
section 1(3)(a) and (b). In the case of an award under section 1(3) there
are, therefore, two distinct stages—the identification and valuation of the
benefit, and the award of the just sum. The amount to be awarded is the
just sum, unless the defendant’s benefit is less, in which event the award
will be limited to the amount of that benefit. The distinction between the
identification and valuation of the defendant’s benefit, and the assessment
of the just sum, is the most controversial part of the Act. It represents the
solution adopted by the legislature of the problem of restitution in cases
where the benefit does not consist of a payment of money; but the solution
so adopted has been criticised by some commentators as productive of
injustice, and it certainly gives rise to considerable problems, to which I
shall refer in due course.
(b)
Identification of the defendant’s benefit. In the course of the argument
before me, there was much dispute whether, in the case of services, the
benefit should be identified as the services themselves, or as the end
product of the services. One example canvassed (because it bore some
relationship to the facts of the present case) was the example of
prospecting for minerals. If minerals are discovered, should the benefit be
regarded … simply as the services of prospecting, or … as the minerals
themselves being the end product of the successful exercise? Now, I am
satisfied that it was the intention of the legislature, to be derived from
section 1(3) as a matter of construction, that the benefit should in an
appropriate case be identified as the end product of the services. This
appears, in my judgment, not only from the fact that section 1(3)
distinguishes between the plaintiff’s performance and the defendant’s
benefit, but also from section 1(3)(b) which clearly relates to the product of
the plaintiff’s performance. Let me take the example of a building contract.
Suppose that a contract for work on a building is frustrated by a fire which
destroys the building and which, therefore, also destroys a substantial
amount of work already done by the plaintiff. Although it might be thought
just to award the plaintiff a sum assessed on a quantum meruit basis,
probably a rateable part of the contract price, in respect of the work he has
done, the effect of section 1(3)(b) will be to reduce the award to nil,
because of the effect, in relation to the defendant’s benefit, of the
circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract. It is quite plain
that, in section 1(3)(b), the word ‘benefit’ is intended to refer, in the example
I have given, to the actual improvement to the building, because that is
what will be affected by the frustrating event; the subsection therefore
contemplates that, in such a case, the benefit is the end product of the
plaintiff’s services, not the services themselves. This will not be so in every
case, since in some cases the services will have no end product; for
example, where the services consist of doing such work as surveying, or
transporting goods. In each case, it is necessary to ask the question: what
benefit has the defendant obtained by reason of the plaintiff’s contractual
performance? But it must not be forgotten that in section 1(3) the relevance
of the value of the benefit is to fix a ceiling to the award. If, for example, in a
building contract, the building is only partially completed, the value of 
the
partially completed building (i.e. the product of the services) will fix a ceiling
(c)
(d)
for the award; the stage of the work may be such that the uncompleted
building may be worth less than the value of the work and materials that
have gone into it, particularly as completion by another builder may cost
more than completion by the original builder would have cost. In other
cases, however, the actual benefit to the defendant may be considerably
more than the appropriate or just sum to be awarded to the plaintiff, in
which event the value of the benefit will not in fact determine the quantum
of the award. I should add, however, that, in a case of prospecting, it would
usually be wrong to identify the discovered mineral as the benefit. In such a
case there is always (whether the prospecting is successful or not) the
benefit of the prospecting itself, i.e. of knowing whether or not the land
contains any deposit of the relevant minerals; if the prospecting is
successful, the benefit may include also the enhanced value of the land by
reason of the discovery; if the prospector’s contractual task goes beyond
discovery and includes development and production, the benefit will include
the further enhancement of the land by reason of the installation of the
facilities, and also the benefit of in part transforming a valuable mineral
deposit into a marketable commodity.
I add by way of footnote that all these difficulties would have been avoided
if the legislature had thought it right to treat the services themselves as the
benefit. In the opinion of many commentators, it would be more just to do
so; after all, the services in question have been requested by the
defendant, who normally takes the risk that they may prove worthless, from
whatever cause. In the example I have given of the building destroyed by
fire, there is much to be said for the view that the builder should be paid for
the work he has done, unless he has (for example by agreeing to insure the
works) taken upon himself the risk of destruction by fire. But my task is to
construe the Act as it stands. On the true construction of the Act, it is in my
judgment clear that the defendant’s benefit must, in an appropriate case, be
identified as the end product of the plaintiff’s services, despite the difficulties
which this construction creates, difficulties which are met again when one
comes to value the benefit.
Apportioning the benefit. In all cases, the relevant benefit must have been
obtained by the defendant by reason of something done by the plaintiff.
Accordingly, where it is appropriate to identify the benefit with an end
(e)
product and it appears that the defendant has obtained the benefit by
reason of work done both by the plaintiff and by himself, the court will have
to do its best to apportion that benefit, and to decide what proportion is
attributable to the work done by the plaintiff. That proportion will then
constitute the relevant benefit for the purposes of section 1(3) of the Act.
Valuing the benefit. Since the benefit may be identified with the product of
the plaintiff’s performance, great problems arise in the valuation of the
benefit. First, how does one solve the problem which arises from the fact
that a small service may confer an enormous benefit, and conversely, a
very substantial service may confer only a very small benefit? The answer
presumably is that at the stage of valuation of the benefit (as opposed to
assessment of the just sum) the task of the court is simply to assess the
value of the benefit to the defendant. For example, if a prospector after
some very simple prospecting discovers a large and unexpected deposit of
a valuable mineral, the benefit to the defendant (namely, the enhancement
in the value of the land) may be enormous; it must be valued as such,
always bearing in mind that the assessment of a just sum may very well
lead to a much smaller amount being awarded to the plaintiff. But
conversely, the plaintiff may have undertaken building work for a substantial
sum which is, objectively speaking, of little or no value—for example, he
may commence the redecoration, 
to the defendant’s execrable taste, of
rooms which are in good decorative order. If the contract is frustrated
before the work is complete, and the work is unaffected by the frustrating
event, it can be argued that the defendant has obtained no benefit, because
the defendant’s property has been reduced in value by the plaintiff’s work;
but the partial work must be treated as a benefit to the defendant, since he
requested it, and valued it as such. Secondly, at what point in time is the
benefit to be valued? If there is a lapse of time between the date of the
receipt of the benefit, and the date of frustration, there may in the
meanwhile be a substantial variation in the value of the benefit. If the
benefit had simply been identified as the services rendered, this problem
would not arise; the court would simply award a reasonable remuneration
for the services rendered at the time when they were rendered, the
defendant taking the risk of any subsequent depreciation and the benefit of
any subsequent appreciation in value. But that is not what the Act provides:
section 1(3)(b) makes it plain that the plaintiff is to take the risk of
depreciation or destruction by the frustrating event. If the effect of the
frustrating event upon the value of the benefit is to be measured, it must
surely be measured upon the benefit as at the date of frustration. For
example, let it be supposed that a builder does work which doubles in value
by the date of frustration, and is then so severely damaged by fire that the
contract is frustrated; the valuation of the residue must surely be made on
the basis of the value as at the date of frustration. However, does this mean
that, for the purposes of section 1(3), the benefit is always to be valued as
at the date of frustration? For example, if goods are transferred and
retained by the defendant till frustration when they have appreciated or
depreciated in value, are they to be valued as at the date of frustration?
The answer must, I think, generally speaking, be in the affirmative, for the
sake of consistency. But this raises an acute problem in relation to the time
value of money. Suppose that goods are supplied and sold, long before the
date of frustration; does the principle that a benefit is to be valued as at the
date of frustration require that allowance must be made for the use in the
meanwhile of the money obtained by the disposal of the goods, in order to
obtain a true valuation of the benefit as at the date of frustration? This was
one of the most hotly debated matters before me, for the very good reason
that in the present case it affects the valuation of the parties’ respective
benefits by many millions of dollars. It is very tempting to conclude that an
allowance should be made for the time value of money, because it appears
to lead to a more realistic valuation of the benefit as at the date of
frustration; and, as will appear hereafter, an appropriate method for making
such an allowance is available in the form of the net discounted cash flow
system of accounting. But I have come to the conclusion that, as a matter
of construction, this course is not open to me. First, the subsection limits
the award to the value of the benefit obtained by the defendant; and it does
not follow that, because the defendant has had the money over a period of
time, he has in fact derived any benefit from it. Secondly, if an allowance
was to be made for the time value of the money obtained by the defendant,
a comparable allowance should be made in respect of expenses incurred
by the defendant, i.e. in respect of the period between the date of incurring
the expenditure and the date of frustration, and section 1(3)(a) only
contemplates that the court, in making an allowance for expenses, shall
(f)
(g)
have regard to the ‘amount of [the] expenses.’ Thirdly, as I have already
indicated, no allowance for the time value of money can be made under
section 1(2); and it would be inconsistent to make such an allowance under
section 1(3) but not under section 1(2) …
Finally, I should record that the court is required to have regard to the effect,
in relation to the defendant’s benefit, of the circumstances giving rise to the
frustration of the 
contract. I have already given an example of how this may
be relevant, in the case of building contracts; and I have recorded the fact
that this provision has been the subject of criticism. There may, however, be
circumstances where it would not be just to have regard to this factor—for
example if, under a building contract, it was expressly agreed that the work
in progress should be insured by the building-owner against risks which
include the event which had the effect of frustrating the contract and
damaging or destroying the work.
Assessment of the just sum. The principle underlying the Act is prevention
of the unjust enrichment of the defendant at the plaintiff’s expense. Where,
as in cases under section 1(2), the benefit conferred on the defendant
consists of payment of a sum of money, the plaintiff’s expense and the
defendant’s enrichment are generally equal; and, subject to other relevant
factors, the award of restitution will consist simply of an order for repayment
of a like sum of money. But where the benefit does not consist of money,
then the defendant’s enrichment will rarely be equal to the plaintiff’s
expense. In such cases, where (as in the case of a benefit conferred under
a contract thereafter frustrated) the benefit has been requested by the
defendant, the basic measure of recovery in restitution is the reasonable
value of the plaintiff’s performance—in a case of services, a quantum
meruit or reasonable remuneration, and in a case of goods, a quantum
valebat or reasonable price. Such cases are to be contrasted with cases
where such a benefit has not been requested by the defendant. In the latter
class of case, recovery is rare in restitution; but if the sole basis of recovery
was that the defendant had been incontrovertibly benefited, it might be
legitimate to limit recovery to the defendant’s actual benefit—a limit which
has (perhaps inappropriately) been imported by the legislature into section
1(3) of the Act. However, under section 1(3) as it stands, if the defendant’s
actual benefit is less than the just or reasonable sum which would
(h)
otherwise be awarded to the plaintiff, the award must be reduced to a sum
equal to the amount of the defendant’s benefit.
A crucial question, upon which the Act is surprisingly silent, is this: what
bearing do the terms of the contract, under which the plaintiff has acted,
have upon the assessment of the just sum? First, the terms upon which the
work was done may serve to indicate the full scope of the work done, and
so be relevant to the sum awarded in respect of such work … Secondly, the
contract consideration is always relevant as providing some evidence of
what will be a reasonable sum to be awarded in respect of the plaintiff’s
work. … Thirdly, however, the contract consideration, or a rateable part of it,
may provide a limit to the sum to be awarded … It is unnecessary for me to
decide whether this will always be so; but it is likely that in most cases this
will impose an important limit upon the sum to be awarded—indeed it may
well be the most relevant limit to an award under section 1(3) of the Act.
The legal basis of the limit may be section 2(3) of the Act; but even if that
subsection is inapplicable, it is open to the court, in an appropriate case, to
give effect to such a limit in assessing the just sum to be awarded under
section 1(3), because in many cases it would be unjust to impose upon the
defendant an obligation to make restitution under the subsection at higher
than the contract rate.
Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeal ([1981] 1 WLR 232) on various points and
the defendants further appealed to the House of Lords ([1983] 2 AC 352). The grounds
of appeal generally concerned issues with which we are not here concerned. But there is
one passage from the judgment of Lawton LJ in the Court of Appeal which is of
considerable 
significance. Its importance lies in the fact that it casts doubt upon the
analytical approach adopted by Robert Goff J, in particular, his attempt to analyse the
Act in terms of an underlying principle of the prevention of unjust enrichment. Lawton
LJ stated (at pp. 237–238 and 241–243):
The Act of 1943 was passed shortly after the decision of the House of Lords in 
Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna
 
v.
Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd
 
[1943] AC 32, which overruled 
Chandler
 
v. 
Webster
 
[1904] 1 KB 493.
The earlier case had been regarded as authority for the proposition that, on the occurrence of an event which
frustrates the performance of a contract, the loss lies where it falls and that money paid by one party to the
contract to the other party is to be retained by the party in whose hands it is. The object of the Act was to make
the operation of the law more fair when a contract governed by English law … has become impossible of
performance and the parties to it have for that reason been discharged from further performance. This was to be
done by adjusting the rights and liabilities of the parties in the ways set out: see section 1(1). …
Before the court can make an award under [section 1(3)] it must be satisfied that one party to a contract has
obtained a valuable benefit by reason of something done by the other. In this case the plaintiffs did a great deal
for the defendant and he obtained, before the frustrating events happened, a most valuable benefit from what
they had done for him, which was so great that it was incapable of any exact valuation. This part of the problem
presented no difficulties for the judge. What was difficult was the assessment of the sum which the court
considered just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case. Save for what is mentioned in paragraphs (a)
and (b), the subsection gives no help as to how, or upon what principles, the court is to make its assessment or
as to what factors it is to take into account. The responsibility lies with the judge: he has to fix a sum which he,
not an appellate court, considers just. This word connotes the mental processes going to forming an opinion.
What is just is what the trial judge thinks is just. That being so, an appellate court is not entitled to interfere
with his decision unless it is so plainly wrong that it cannot be just. The concept of what is just is not an absolute
one. Opinions among right thinking people may, and probably will, differ as to what is just in a particular case.
No one person enjoys the faculty of infallibility as to what is just. It is with these considerations in mind that we
approach this case.
The judge assessed the just sum on what can be described as a reimbursement basis, that is to say, by
ensuring as far as was practicable that the plaintiffs got back what they had paid out on the defendant’s behalf
before the frustrating events happened …
Mr Rokison, on behalf of the plaintiffs, accepted that there could be more than one way of assessing a just
sum. He pointed out that there was nothing in the Act to indicate that its purpose was to enable the judge to
apportion losses or profits, or to put the parties in the positions which they would have been in if the contract
had been fully performed or if it had never been made. This we accept. He submitted that the concept behind
the Act was to prevent unjust enrichment. This is what the judge had thought. We get no help from the use of
words which are not in the statute. … In our judgment, this court would not be justified in setting aside the
judge’s way of assessment merely because we thought that there were better ways. Mr Rokison tried to show
that the judge’s way was wrong and palpably wrong. … In our judgment, it cannot be said that the judge went
wrong, and certainly not palpably wrong, in assessing a just sum by reference to the concept of reimbursing the
plaintiffs.
Commentary
Applying the principles he had set out to the complex facts of the case, Robert Goff J
concluded that the ‘valuable benefit’ which Mr Hunt obtained as a result of the work
done by BP before the frustration of the contract was the ‘end product’ of BP’s services.
This Robert Goff J identified with the enhancement in the value of Mr Hunt’s
concession. When valuing that benefit Robert Goff J held that section 1(3)(b) required
him to take account of the circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract
which, on the facts, had the effect of reducing the value of the benefit to the value of the
oil which Mr Hunt had actually obtained from the oil field and the financial settlement
which he had reached with the Libyan government. In assessing the ‘just sum’ BP were
awarded the costs and expenses which they had incurred on Mr Hunt’s account plus the
‘farm-in’ contributions in cash and oil received by Mr Hunt less the reimbursement oil
which BP had received. In essence, the just sum was the reasonable value of the services
rendered and goods supplied by BP with counter-restitution being made for the value of
the oil received by BP.
Leaving to one side the complex facts of the case, three principal issues arise out of

The first relates to the principle which underpins the Act. Robert Goff J stated that the
principle was the prevention of unjust enrichment, whereas Lawton LJ stated,
somewhat dismissively, that the court derived ‘no help from the use of words which are
not in the statute’. This leaves the basis of the Act obscure. The analysis of Robert Goff J
does, however, seem to be the preferable one. The Act is not designed to provide a
flexible machinery for the adjustment of losses. Unlike legislation subsequently enacted
in other parts of the Commonwealth, the 1943 Act does not empower the court to
apportion losses between parties to the contract. While the Act does confer a discretion
upon the court, it is not a discretion that relates explicitly to the apportionment of
losses. In all cases the court must first identify the benefit which the defendant has
obtained at the expense of the claimant. The discretion given to the court relates only to
the proportion of that benefit which is recoverable by the claimant. It is a discretion
exercisable within a framework which seeks to prevent the unjust enrichment of one
party at the expense of the other.
The second point relates to the scope of section 1(2). This subsection was not directly in
issue on the facts of 
BP
 
v. 
Hunt
 
but it was nevertheless analysed in some detail by
Robert Goff J. Section 1(2) differs from 
Fibrosa
 
in two principal respects. First, the
entitlement of the payor to recover the money paid is not confined to cases in which
there has been a total failure of consideration. Money paid is recoverable even upon a
partial failure of consideration. Secondly, the proviso to section 1(2) gives to the court a
discretion to allow the payee to retain some or all of the prepayment that has been
made. Robert Goff J rationalized the proviso as a statutory recognition of the defence of
change of position. A rather different approach was, however, taken by Garland J in
Gamerco SA
 
v. 
ICM/Fair Warning (Agency) Ltd
 
[1995] 1 WLR 1226. A contract to
promote a rock concert was held to have been frustrated when the permit to hold the
concert at a sports stadium in Madrid was suddenly withdrawn because of safety fears

about the stadium. The plaintiff promoters had paid the defendant group the sum of
$412,500 prior to the frustration of the contract and both parties had incurred
expenditure in preparing for the concert. Garland J held that the plaintiffs were entitled
to the return of the prepayment which they had made under section 
1(2) of the Act and
that no deduction should be made under the proviso to that subsection. The plaintiffs
were therefore entitled to recover the $412,500. In so concluding Garland J stated (at
pp. 1236–1237):
Various views have been advanced as to how the court should exercise its discretion and these can be
categorised as follows:
Total retention
. This view was advanced by the Law Revision Committee in 1939 (Cmnd 6009) on the
questionable ground ‘that it is reasonable to assume that in stipulating for pre-payment the payee
intended to protect himself from loss under the contract’. As the editor of 
Chitty on Contracts
, 27th edn,
(1994) vol 1., 1141, para 23–060, note 15 (Mr EG McKendrick) comments: ‘He probably intends to
protect himself against the possibility of the other party’s insolvency or default in payment’. To this, one
can add: ‘and secure his own cash flow’.
[He then considered two passages from the judgment of Robert Goff J in 
BP
 
v. 
Hunt
 
set out at pp. 717–718,
earlier in the section, and continued]
I do not derive any specific assistance from the 
BP Exploration
 
case. There was no question of any change of
position as a result of the plaintiffs’ advance payment.
Equal division
. This was discussed by Professor Treitel in 
Frustration and Force Majeure
 
pp. 555–556
at paras 15–059 and 15–060 of his book. There is some attraction in splitting the loss but what if the
losses are very unequal? Professor Treitel considers statutory provisions in Canada and Australia but
makes the point that equal division is unnecessarily rigid and was rejected by the Law Revision
Commission in the 1939 report to which reference has already been made. The parties may, he suggests,
have had unequal means of providing against the loss by insurers, but he appears to overlook sub-
section (5). It may well be that one party’s expenses are entirely thrown away while the other is left with
some realisable or otherwise usable benefit or advantage. Their losses may, as in the present case, be
very unequal. Professor Treitel therefore favours the third view.
Broad discretion
. It is self-evident that any rigid rule is liable to produce injustice. The words, ‘if it
considers it just so to do in all the circumstances of the case’ clearly confer a very broad discretion.
Obviously the court must not take into account anything which is not ‘a circumstance of the case’ or fail
to take into account anything that is and then exercise its discretion rationally. I see no indication in the
Act, the authorities, or the relevant literature that the court is obliged to incline either towards total
retention or equal division. Its task is to do justice in a situation which the parties neither contemplated
nor provided for, and to mitigate the possible harshness of allowing all loss to lie where it has fallen.
I have not found my task easy. As I have made clear, I would have welcomed assistance on the true measure of
the defendants’ loss and the proper treatment of overhead and non-specific expenditure. Because the
defendants have plainly suffered some loss, I have made a robust assumption. In all the circumstances, and
having particular regard to the plaintiffs’ loss, I consider that justice is done by making no deduction under the
proviso.
We can see here the same approach as that adopted by the Court of Appeal in 
BP
 
v.
Hunt
, namely an emphasis on the discretion of the court and a refusal to confine that
discretion by seeking to articulate the principles upon which the exercise of the
discretion is based. One point which does, however, emerge with some clarity from
Gamerco
 
relates 
to the location of the onus of proof. Garland J stated that the onus of
proof was on the defendant. The significance of this can be seen from the case of 
Lobb
 
v.
Vasey Housing Auxiliary
 
[1963] VR 239. The defendants were paid £1,250 by Mrs
Smith for an exclusive licence to occupy a flat in a block of flats which they were
building. Mrs Smith died before her flat was completed. The defendants refused to
return the £1,250. Mrs Smith’s executrix sued to recover it. It was held that the death of
Mrs Smith frustrated the contract between the parties and that the onus of proof was on
the defendants to show that it was just in all the circumstances of the case for them to
retain any part of the prepayment. They were unable to do this. The trial judge stated
that in the typical case one would expect the defendants to sell the right to occupy the
flat to someone else and to recover their expenses in that way.
The third point relates to the construction of section 1(3). The most important point
here is Robert Goff J’s interpretation of ‘valuable benefit’. He concluded that, in ‘an
appropriate case’, the benefit is to be identified with the ‘end product’ of the claimant’s
services and not with the services themselves. This has unfortunate consequences where
the effect of the frustrating event is to destroy the work of the claimant. In such a case
there is no end product and so nothing to value. An example is provided by the old case
of 
Appleby
 
v. 
Myers
 
(1867) LR 2 CP 651. The plaintiffs contracted to make and erect
machinery in the defendant’s factory and to maintain the machinery for a period of two
years. After part of the machinery had been erected, an accidental fire destroyed the
factory and the machinery and so frustrated the contract. It was held that the plaintiffs
were not entitled to recover any payment in respect of the work done prior to the
frustration of the contract. The same result would appear to follow under section 1(3).
The result is an unfortunate one but here it must be recalled that the Act does not seek
to engage in loss apportionment as such. A claimant can only recover where the
defendant has received a benefit as a result of the work he has done and the
consequence of identifying the benefit with the end product of the work is to narrow the
concept of benefit that underpins the Act so that reliance expenditure which does not
result in an end product will not be recoverable under section 1(3). An example of this is
provided by 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
(
21.1
) itself. The claim brought by the plaintiffs was one
to recover the expenses they had incurred in advertising the concerts. It is unlikely that
such expenditure would generate a claim under the Act because it does not result in a
valuable benefit to the defendant.
A three-stage approach must be taken to any claim brought under section 1(3). First, the
benefit itself must be identified. The benefit will generally be the goods or, in the case of
the provision of services, the end product of these services. Secondly, the benefit must
be valued. Thirdly, the court must decide what is a ‘just sum’ on the facts of the case. The
‘just sum’ cannot exceed the value of the benefit conferred. In 
BP
 
v. 
Hunt
 
Robert Goff J
took a similar approach to that taken in a restitutionary claim and held that the just sum
was, essentially, the reasonable value of the services rendered. But the Court of Appeal
chose to place emphasis instead on the discretion of the judge at first instance. Thus
Lawton LJ stated that ‘what is just is what the trial judge thinks is just’ and that an
appellate court is not entitled to interfere with the finding of the just sum by the trial
judge unless it is ‘so plainly wrong that it cannot be just’. On this view the trial judge has
a substantial measure of discretion and it is extremely difficult to predict what will
constitute a ‘just sum’ in any case involving the provision of services prior to the
frustration of the contract. In this respect it is perhaps fortunate that a frustrated
contract is a comparative rarity in commercial practice. This being the case, the Act
rarely comes into play and so the deficiencies in the Act and in the reasoning of the
Court of Appeal in 
BP
 
v. 
Hunt
 
rarely come to light.
21.7
 
The Basis of Frustration
What is the basis of the doctrine of frustration? Given that the courts do not have the
power at common law to set aside a term on the basis that it is unreasonable, on what
basis can the courts claim to be entitled to set aside an entire contract on the ground
that the circumstances have turned out to be radically different from those which the
parties had in mind when they entered into the contract? Perhaps surprisingly, these
questions do not appear to have troubled the courts. The doctrine of frustration is well
established, albeit that its exact juridical basis remains uncertain. The different possible
bases for the doctrine of frustration were, however, discussed by the House of Lords in
National Carriers Ltd
 
v. 
Panalpina (Northern) Ltd
 
[1981] AC 675, alongside the
question of whether or not a lease can be frustrated. While the House of Lords decided
in clear terms that a lease could, in principle, be frustrated, they were less clear as to the
basis of the doctrine of frustration.
NATIONAL CARRIERS LTD V. PANALPINA (NORTHERN)
LTD
[1981] AC 675, House of Lords
National Carriers, the respondents, owned a warehouse on English Street,
Kingston-upon-Hull. By an agreement dated 12 July 1974 they leased the
warehouse to Panalpina, the appellants, for a ten-year term. Panalpina used the
warehouse for the commercial storage of goods. They agreed not to use the
warehouse other than for this purpose without the consent of National Carriers.
The only vehicular access to the warehouse was by Kingston Street. On 16 May
1979 the Kingston-upon-Hull City Council closed Kingston Street to allow the
demolition of a derelict building nearby. Kingston Street was closed for 20 months.
During this time Panalpina could not use the warehouse and stopped paying rent
to National Carriers. National Carriers brought an action for unpaid rent. In its
defence Panalpina claimed that the lease had been frustrated by the closure of
Kingston Street. The judge held that he was bound by authority to decide that a
lease could not be the subject of frustration. The House of Lords held that the
doctrine of frustration was in principle applicable to leases (Lord Russell 
dubitante
)
but that, on the facts, the lease in this case had not been frustrated.
Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC
The doctrine of frustration is of comparatively recent development …
It is generally accepted that the doctrine of frustration has its roots in the
decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench given by Blackburn J in 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
(1863) 3 B & S 826 …
At least five theories of the basis of the doctrine of frustration have been put
forward at various times, and, since the theoretical basis of the doctrine is clearly
relevant to the point under discussion, I enumerate them here. The first is the
‘implied term’ or ‘implied condition’ theory on which Blackburn J plainly relied in
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
, as applying to the facts of the case before him. To these it is
admirably suited. The weakness, it seems to me, of the implied term theory is that
it raises once more the spectral figure of the officious bystander intruding on the
parties at the moment of agreement. In the present case, had the officious
bystander pointed out to the parties in July 1974 the danger of carrying on the
business of a commercial warehouse opposite a listed building of doubtful stability
and asked them what they would do in the event of a temporary closure of
Kingston Street pending a public local inquiry into a proposal for demolition after
the lease had been running for over five years, I have not the 
least idea what they
would have said, or whether either would have entered into the lease at all. In
Embiricos
 
v. 
Sydney Reid & Co
 
[1914] 3 KB 45, 54 Scrutton J appears to make the
estimate of what constitutes a frustrating event something to be ascertained only at
the time when the parties to a contract are called on to make up their minds, and
this I would think to be right, both as to the inconclusiveness of hindsight which
Scrutton J had primarily in mind and as to the inappropriateness of the intrusion of
an officious bystander immediately prior to the conclusion of the agreement.
Counsel for the respondent sought to argue that 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
, 3 B & S
826, could as easily have been decided on the basis of a total failure of
consideration. This is the second of the five theories. But 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
was
clearly not so decided, and in any event many, if not most, cases of frustration
which have followed 
Taylor
 
v. 
Caldwell
 
have occurred during the currency of a
contract partly executed on both sides, when no question of total failure of
consideration can possibly arise.
In 
Hirji Mulji
 
v. 
Cheong Yue Steamship Co Ltd
 
[1926] AC 497, 510 Lord Sumner
seems to have formulated the doctrine as a ‘ … device [sic], by which the rules as
to absolute contracts are reconciled with a special exception which justice
demands’ and Lord Wright in 
Denny, Mott & Dickson Ltd
 
v. 
James B Fraser & Co
Ltd
 
[1944] AC 265, 275 seems to prefer this formulation to the implied condition
view. The weakness of the formulation, however, if the implied condition theory,
with which Lord Sumner coupled it, be rejected, is that, though it admirably
expresses the purpose of the doctrine, it does not provide it with any theoretical
basis at all.
Hirji Mulji
 
v. 
Cheong Yue Steamship Co Ltd
 
is, it seems to me, really an
example of the more sophisticated theory of ‘frustration of the adventure’ or
‘foundation of the contract’ formulation, said to have originated with 
Jackson
 
v.
Union Marine Insurance Co Ltd
 
(1874) LR 10 CP 125, compare also, for example,
per Goddard J in 
W J Tatem Ltd
 
v. 
Gamboa
 
[1939] 1 KB 132, 138. This, of course,
leaves open the question of what is, in any given case, the foundation of the
contract or what is ‘fundamental’ to it, or what is the ‘adventure’. Another theory, of
which the parent may have been Earl Loreburn in 
F A Tamplin Steamship Co Ltd
 
v.
Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co Ltd
 
[1916] 2 AC 397 is that the doctrine is
based on the answer to the question: ‘What in fact is the true meaning of the
contract?’: see p. 404. This is the ‘construction theory’. In 
Davis Contractors Ltd
 
v.
Fareham Urban District Council
 
[1956] AC 696, 729 Lord Radcliffe put the matter
thus, and it is the formulation I personally prefer:
‘ … frustration occurs whenever the law recognises that without default of either party a contractual
obligation has become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which performance
is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract.
Non haec in foedera veni
. It was not this that I promised to do.’
Incidentally, it may be partly because I look at frustration from this point of view that
I find myself so much in agreement with my noble and learned friends that the
appellants here have failed to raise any triable issue as to frustration by the purely
temporary, though prolonged, and in 1979 indefinite, interruption, then expected to
last about a year, in the access to the demised premises. In all fairness, however, I
must say that my approach to the question involves me in the view that whether a
supervening event is a frustrating event or not is, in a wide variety of cases, a
question of degree, and therefore to some extent at least of fact, whereas in your
Lordships’ House in 
Tsakiroglou & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Noblee Thorl GmbH
 
[1962] AC 93 the
question is treated as one at least involving a question of law, or, at best, a
question of mixed law and fact …
This discussion brings me to the central point at issue in this case which, in my
view, is whether or not there is anything in the nature of an executed lease which
prevents the doctrine of frustration, however formulated, applying to the subsisting
relationship between the 
parties. That the point is open in this House is clear from
the difference of opinion expressed in 
Cricklewood Property and Investment Trust
Ltd
 
v. 
Leighton’s Investment Trust Ltd
 
[1945] AC 221 between the second Lord
Russell of Killowen and Lord Goddard on the one hand, who answered the
question affirmatively, and Viscount Simon LC and Lord Wright on the other, who
answered it negatively, with Lord Porter reserving his opinion until the point arose
definitively for consideration. The point, though one of principle, is a narrow one. It
is the difference immortalised in HMS Pinafore between ‘never’ and ‘hardly ever’,
since both Viscount Simon and Lord Wright clearly conceded that, though they
thought the doctrine applicable in principle to leases, the cases in which it could
properly be applied must be extremely rare.
With the view of Viscount Simon and Lord Wright I respectfully agree. … I
conclude that the matter is not decided by authority and that the question is open
to your Lordships to decide on principle. In my view your Lordships ought now so
to decide it. Is there anything in principle which ought to prevent a lease from ever
being frustrated? I think there is not …
In the result, I come down on the side of the ‘hardly ever’ school of thought. No
doubt the circumstances in which the doctrine can apply to leases are, to quote
Viscount Simon LC in the 
Cricklewood
 
case, at p. 231, ‘exceedingly rare’. Lord
Wright appears to have thought the same, whilst adhering to the view that there
are cases in which frustration can apply, at p. 241. But, as he said in the same
passage: ‘ … the doctrine of frustration is modern and flexible and is not subject to
being constricted by an arbitrary formula’. To this school of thought I respectfully
adhere.
Lord Wilberforce
Various theories have been expressed as to [the] justification [for the doctrine of
frustration] in law: as a device by which the rules as to absolute contracts are
reconciled with a special exception which justice demands, as an implied term, as
a matter of construction of the contract, as related to removal of the foundation of
the contract, as a total failure of consideration. It is not necessary to attempt
selection of any one of these as the true basis: my own view would be that they
shade into one another and that a choice between them is a choice of what is most
appropriate to the particular contract under consideration … the doctrine can now
be stated generally as part of the law of contract; as all judicially evolved doctrines
it is, and ought to be, flexible and capable of new applications.
In my opinion … though such cases may be rare, the doctrine of frustration is
capable of application to leases of land. It must be so applied with proper regard to
the fact that a lease, that is, a grant of a legal estate, is involved. The court must
consider whether any term is to be implied which would determine the lease in the
event which has happened and/or ascertain the foundation of the agreement and
decide whether this still exists in the light of the terms of the lease, the surrounding
circumstances and any special rules which apply to leases or to the particular
lease in question.
Lord Simon of Glaisdale
A number of theories have been advanced to clothe the doctrine of frustration in
juristic respectability, the two most in favour being the ‘implied term theory’ (which
was potent in the development of the doctrine and which still provides a
satisfactory explanation of many cases) and the ‘theory of a radical change in
obligation’ or ‘construction theory’ (which appears to be the one most generally
accepted today). … My noble and learned friends who have preceded me have
enumerated the various theories … Of all the theories put forward the only one, I
think, incompatible with the application of the doctrine to a lease is that which
explains it as based on a total failure of consideration. Though such may be a
feature of some cases of frustration, it is plainly inadequate as an exhaustive
explanation: there are many cases of frustration where the contract has been
partly executed …
I can for myself see nothing about the fact of creation of an estate or interest in
land which repels the doctrine of frustration. … A fully executed contract cannot be
frustrated; and a sale of land is characteristically such a contract. But a lease is
partly executory: rights and obligations remain outstanding on both sides
throughout its currency. Even a partly executed contract is susceptible of
frustration in so far as it remains executory: there are many such cases in the
books. … My conclusion on the first issue is therefore that the doctrine of
frustration is in principle applicable to leases.
Lord Roskill
My Lords, I do not find it necessary to examine in detail the jurisprudential
foundation upon which the doctrine of frustration supposedly rests. At least five
theories have been advanced at different times. … At one time without doubt the
implied term theory found most favour, and there is high authority in its support.
But weighty judicial opinion has since moved away from that view. What is
sometimes called the construction theory has found greater favour. But my Lords,
if I may respectfully say so, I think the most satisfactory explanation of the doctrine
is that given by Lord Radcliffe in 
Davis Contractors
 
v. 
Fareham UDC
 
[1956] AC
696, 728. There must have been by reason of some supervening event some such
fundamental change of circumstances as to enable the court to say—‘this was not
the bargain which these parties made and their bargain must be treated as at an
end’—a view which Lord Radcliffe himself tersely summarised in a quotation of five
words from the Aeneid ‘
non haec in foedera veni
’. Since in such a case the crucial
question must be answered as one of law—see the decision of your Lordships’
House in 
Tsakiroglou & Co Ltd
 
v. 
Noblee Thorl GmbH
 
[1962] AC 93—by reference
to the particular contract which the parties made and to the particular facts of the
case in question, there is, I venture to think, little difference between Lord
Radcliffe’s view and the so-called construction theory.
Lord Russell of Killowen
 
concurred in the result but expressed his doubts about
the application of the doctrine of frustration to leases.
Commentary
Does the debate as to the jurisprudential basis of the doctrine of frustration matter?
Probably not a great deal. The issue is put as follows in H Beale (ed), 
Chitty on
Contracts
 
(34th edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2021), para 26–018 (footnotes omitted):
It is … difficult to discern any practical consequence which flows from the different tests because, as Lord
Wilberforce has stated, they appear to shade into each other. The courts have regard to the construction of the
contract, the effect of the changed circumstances on the parties’ contractual obligations, the intentions of the
parties (objectively construed) and the demands of justice in deciding whether or not a contract has been
frustrated. No one factor is conclusive: the court will balance these different factors in determining whether a
contract has been frustrated. On the other hand, it must be conceded that the basis of the doctrine is not
unimportant in jurisprudential terms. A test based on a fictitious or artificial assumption (such as the implied
term approach) may prevent a proper understanding of the function of 
the doctrine and of the role of the court
in applying it. And the literal application of one theory might lead to results which are incompatible with the
rules which presently make up the doctrine of frustration. For example, the implied term theory, literally
applied, may suggest that the question whether a contract is frustrated is one of fact, based on the intention of
the parties, but it is clear law that the question whether a contract has been frustrated is one of law. It is,
however, unlikely that a modern court would apply a theory where it led to a result which was incompatible with
the present rules and so it is submitted that no practical consequences flow from the debate as to the correct
conceptual basis of the doctrine of frustration.
The statement that it is unlikely that practical consequences flow from the debate as to
the correct conceptual basis of the doctrine plainly does not tell us what is the correct
conceptual basis. It could be a concern for the fairness of the bargain made by the
parties: in this sense it could be said that the courts are struggling to strike a balance
between a concern for the fairness of the bargain made by the parties and the desire to
hold people to the terms of their contract. On the other hand, it could be said that the
courts are primarily engaged in an interpretative exercise; that is to say they are
endeavouring to ascertain whether or not the parties have made provision for the event
which has occurred and, if they have not, to determine whether performance of the
bargain according to its terms in the changed circumstances would be something
radically different from the obligations which the parties had originally assumed under
their contract.
From a comparative perspective, one of the most striking features of the doctrine of
frustration in English law is the narrow scope within which it operates. There are two
points here. First, the doctrine is rarely invoked and, secondly, where it is applicable, its
effect is to discharge the contract. The courts are not given a power to adjust the
contract to meet the changed circumstances; they must either uphold the contract
according to its terms or set it aside. Parties who wish to adjust their contract must
insert an express term in the contract to this effect. In other legal systems the courts do
have broader powers to intervene and to adjust the contract. As far as English law is
concerned, it is for the parties to protect themselves against the consequences of an
improvident bargain by inserting an appropriately drafted force majeure clause or
hardship clause into the contract: they cannot rely on the courts to act as their saviour.
It can be argued that this approach unnecessarily increases the transaction costs of the
parties because it compels them to incur the cost of drawing up an appropriate clause.
On the other hand, the diversity and sophistication of the various force majeure and
hardship clauses currently in use demonstrates that these are complex issues and it can
be said with some justification that they are best dealt with by the parties and not by the
courts. Further, a cost of giving a power to the court to adjust contracts in a wider range
of circumstances is that it will generate uncertainty. The current English position may
be harsh on a party who has entered into a bad bargain, but it has the merit of being
clear. Once again we can see the tension between the demands of certainty and a
concern for fairness.
The narrow scope of the doctrine of frustration has been questioned by some lawyers in
the light of the current global pandemic. The 19 pandemic has had an enormous impact
on many businesses, particularly in the travel and leisure industries. Two cases have
thus far come before the English courts where the contract was one for the lease of
aeroplanes which were grounded as a consequence of the pandemic (see 
Salam Air
SAOC
 
v. 
LATAM Airlines Group plc
 
[2020] EWHC 2414 (Comm) and 
Wilmington Trust
SP Services (Dublin) Ltd
 
v. 
SpiceJet Ltd
 
[2021] EWHC 1117 (Comm)). In both cases it
was held that the contracts had not been frustrated. This was for two principal reasons.
First, the terms of the lease were held to show 
that the lessees had assumed the risk of
the unavailability of the aircraft and had accepted an extremely broad obligation to
continue to make payment notwithstanding their inability to use the aircraft. Second,
the duration of the leases was between six and 10 years and the unavailability of the
aircraft for approximately 18 months of that period was held to be insufficient to
frustrate the leases. Other jurisdictions have responded more flexibly to the pandemic
by utilizing doctrines such as a hardship doctrine or a doctrine of commercial
impracticability in order to adapt contracts to the changing circumstances (see generally
Klaus Peter Berger and Daniel Behn ‘Force Majeure and Hardship in the Age of Corona:
A Historical and Comparative Study’ (2019–2020) 6 
McGill Journal of Dispute
Resolution
 
78). As we have noted, English law has not gone down this route. If parties
wish to incorporate a hardship clause into their contract (on which see 
12.3.9
), they are
free do so and the courts should give effect to such clauses. But in the absence of such a
clause, a court has no power to adapt the contract to changing circumstances, even a
change of circumstances as extreme and unprecedented as the current pandemic. It may
be that the pandemic will cause English law to reconsider the scope of the doctrine of
1.
frustration (although that reconsideration could only be carried out, in an appropriate
case, by the Supreme Court or, more likely, by the Law Commission).
In this connection it is interesting to compare English law with the Vienna Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Principles of European
Contract Law. The Vienna Convention does not make any provision for hardship or
adjustment of the contract. Article 79 (extracted later) proved to be one of the most
controversial provisions in the Convention. Its scope is uncertain in that it is not clear
what constitutes an ‘impediment’ for the purposes of Article 79(1). Further, the effect of
force majeure is to protect a party against a liability in damages but it leaves other
remedies, such as termination, intact.
Both the Principles of European Contract Law (later in this section) and the Unidroit
Principles make provision for hardship as well as force majeure. Two comments can be
made here. First, it may not always be a straightforward matter to decide whether a
particular case falls within the hardship/change of circumstances provisions or whether
it falls within the force majeure/excuse provisions. Secondly, the hardship/change of
circumstances provisions are likely to generate some uncertainty. The commentary to
Article 6:111 of the Principles of European Contract Law states that ‘the mechanism
reflects the modern trend towards giving the court some power to moderate the rigours
of freedom and sanctity of contract’. This may be true. But in doing so it will generate
uncertainty. In many ways we are debating what is the most appropriate default rule.
English law in principle holds the parties to their bargain and so leaves it to the parties
to make their own provision for events which may make performance more onerous.
The Principles of European Contract Law, by contrast, confer broader powers on the
court, while leaving it open to the parties to exclude these powers should they wish to do
so. Striking the most appropriate balance between these competing considerations is a
difficult matter.
VIENNA CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE
INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS
Article 79
A party is not liable for a failure to perform any of his obligations if he
proves that the failure was due to an impediment beyond his control and he

could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into
account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or
overcome it or its consequences.
If the party’s failure is due to the failure by a third person whom he has
engaged to perform the whole or a part of the contract, that party is exempt
from liability only if:
he is exempt under the preceding paragraph; and
the person whom he has so engaged would be so exempt if the
provisions of that paragraph were applied to him.
The exemption provided by this article has effect for the period during which
the impediment exists.
The party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the
impediment and its effect on his ability to perform. If the notice is not
received by the other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails
to perform knew or ought to have known of the impediment, he is liable for
damages resulting from such non-receipt.
Nothing in this article prevents either party from exercising any right other
than to claim damages under this Convention.
PRINCIPLES OF EUROPEAN CONTRACT LAW
Article 6:111—Change of Circumstances
A party is bound to fulfil its obligations even if performance has become
more onerous, whether because the cost of performance has increased or
because the value of the performance it receives has diminished.
If, however, performance of the contract becomes excessively onerous
because of a change of circumstances, the parties are bound to enter into
negotiations with a view to adapting the contract or terminating it, provided
that:
the change of circumstances occurred after the time of conclusion of
the contract,

(c)

the possibility of a change of circumstances was not one which
could reasonably have been taken into account at the time of
conclusion of the contract, and
the risk of the change of circumstances is not one which, according
to the contract, the party affected should be required to bear.
If the parties fail to reach agreement within a reasonable period, the court
may:
terminate the contract at a date and on terms to be determined by
the court; or
adapt the contract in order to distribute between the parties in a just
and equitable manner the losses and gains resulting from the
change of circumstances.
In either case, the court may award damages for the loss suffered through a party
refusing to negotiate or breaking off negotiations contrary to good faith and fair
dealing.
Article 8:108—Excuse Due to an Impediment
A party’s non-performance is excused if it proves that it is due to an
impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably have been
expected to take the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion
of the contract, or to have avoided or overcome the impediment or its
consequences.
Where the impediment is only temporary the excuse provided by this article
has effect for the period during which the impediment exists. However, if the
delay amounts to a fundamental non-performance, the obligee may treat it
as such.
The non-performing party must ensure that notice of the impediment and of
its effect on its ability to perform is received by the other party within a
reasonable time after the non-performing party knew or ought to have
known of these circumstances. The other party is entitled to damages for
any loss resulting from the non-receipt of such notice.
